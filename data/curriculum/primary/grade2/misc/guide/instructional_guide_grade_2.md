Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 2 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                             4 
 
PREFACE 
 
 
To assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum, several strategies were employed.  The process 
began with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions.  These countries included 
Jamaica, the United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois) Canada and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 
guides).  The documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their 
rationale and philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as 
well as the Scope of Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa 
and several other countries were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of 
English and the Ministry of Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.    
 
Opportunities were also provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers 
throughout The Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen 
teachers throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students in order to get 
their feedback on what they wanted to learn about and the types of learning activities that they enjoyed.  Additionally, a 
focus group was conducted with members from the community that included business owners, parents and those who 
interact with students in after school clubs and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary teachers, one preschool teacher and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment 
Section.  Opportunities were also provided for several of the Family Island teachers to submit content and activities 
through the Education Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time 
engaged in research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction in order to meet the needs 
of their students.

BELIEF STATEMENTS   
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student centered; 
2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make decisions as well as to develop self- 
confidence and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme 
and should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing 
sixth grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our 
students receive at the primary level, lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that 
students are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on the communication skills.  During this particular period in our history, knowledge of the basic 
communication skills is essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and 
more people are being pushed to use on-line services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct 
banking transactions, to pay bills, to make travel arrangements, to access government services and so much more.   
Additionally, changes in technology demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Land lines, 
that only required listening and speaking skills for its use, have been replaced with smart phones and computers where 
we can communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the 
internet, buy tickets, post to Facebook, create blogs, Snapchat, conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the 
world and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be that confidence in our education system that students 
will be prepared to communicate effectively in spite of the changes that occur.  Recognizing that the Language Arts skills 
are the foundation of all learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on 
producing students who are not only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability 
to communicate effectively in a rapidly advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves 
creatively, to collaborate and to problem solve as we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which 
speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education for all...”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of 
Oracy, Reading and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that 
they will need to become life-long learners and to navigate successfully in an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM  
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, 
teachers should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area 
subjects and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual fieldtrips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centers, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level in order to provide teachers and parents with a guide 
for what students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This 
information should be used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also provides an 
indication of the level of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become 
proficient in a particular area, teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted in 
order to make them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the 
end of the course of study.  Teachers should be guided by the content which indicates what students should know 
or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading 
(Phonemic Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar and 
Composition Writing). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds 
on the previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided 
into three categories:  basic, intermediate and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can

access content and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to do so, in order to 
meet the needs of their students.   
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of 
opportunities should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with 
various audiences.  They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large 
group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative 
projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary 
safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with 
students.  Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  In order to avoid 
duplication in the curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best 
applied.  It is expected that once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the 
strands and that they can be assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught the Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This 
particularly refers to reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be 
highlighted.  Students are to be exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are 
taught through teacher read-alouds and independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade 
level. 
                     
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading and after reading. 
 
 


Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 2 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                             22 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening   
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in the area of reading still 
have opportunities to understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (through the use of pictures, video 
clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions    
as students connect skills to their everyday experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle  
the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing to see if students have mastered the skill is to have them  
incorporate it in a writing exercise.  This will give them an opportunity to apply what they have learnt.  Students who 
are able to apply reading skills, would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  Following this      
method of teaching the comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into  
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as 
ends in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and 
Handwriting; however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in 
the case of Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should 
only be scored for what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week the number of 
items on the checklist should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the 
checklist should be continually reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been 
generated.  Students should be aware of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to 
assess their own writing before it is even submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, 
mechanics and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three 
lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of 
grade two cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will 
be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, 
and words from the grade level word list included in the appendices of this document.

Sub-Goal 1:  Engage effectively in listening and speaking situations for different purposes and audiences, and 
communicate using a variety of media. 
 
Objective 1.1  Display the characteristics of a good listener.

It is important to listen attentively 
when someone is speaking.  
When we do not, we sometimes 
miss important information. 
A good listener: 
 sits upright in the chair with 
feet firmly on the floor; 
 looks at the person who is 
speaking; 
 does not raise his/her hand 
when someone is speaking. 
 has hands that are free of 
pencils, papers, toys or similar 
items that can distract; 
 does not speak while 
someone else is speaking; 
 focuses on what the speaker 
is saying; and 
 responds appropriately to 
questions. 
Basic:  Have students compare 
and contrast two volunteers who 
are demonstrating good and 
weak listening behaviours. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
work in pairs and practice 
attentive listening by taking turns 
making eye contact and 
demonstrating appropriate body 
language while they share about 
activities that they like to do. 
 
Advanced:  Have students, in 
small groups, design a “Wanted” 
poster that seeks to find a good 
listener.  Encourage them to 
include all the listening 
characteristics. Have them 
present their posters. 
Utilize a listening 
checklist.  Provide 
students with feedback on 
their performance.  
 copy paper and 
crayons

Needs - There are many needs that people 
have.  People need food to eat, clothes to 
wear, a place to live, to feel safe and 
love.  These needs are best met within the 
family circle. However, there are times when 
family members may not be around.  A 
teacher or another trusted adult can assist. 
Look up at the person when and speak 
loudly and clearly so that the person can 
understand your need(s).

open this jar for me, please?” 
Basic:  Ask students to 
introduce themselves making 
sure to give their full names, 
addresses, dates of birth and 
telephone numbers. 
 
Intermediate:  Have 
students discuss the topic, 
‘The Day I was Sick’.  Have 
them share experiences.  
Probe students to answer 
questions like ‘After you 
realized that you weren’t 
feeling well, what did you 
do?’  What should you have 
done? 
 
Advanced:  Invite a 
policeman as a guest 
speaker to provide students 
with information on how to

There should be a difference in the way 
things are said when speaking to family 
and friends as opposed to when 
speaking to a teacher in the classroom 
or an unfamiliar adult.  A more relaxed 
speech using Bahamian dialect is 
sometimes used with family and friends, 
while a more formal tone, using 
Standard English, is used with 
unfamiliar or unrelated adults.  
        
   Family and            Unrelated Adults    
     Friends               away from Home

Use Standard English  
 
in the classroom 
 
when speaking with an adult 
 
during assembly 
 
Use Bahamian dialect 
 
when playing with friends 
 
at home 
Basic: In an open area outside, 
draw a long line.  Have students 
stand on that line.  The left of the 
line should be labelled “Dialect” 
and the right of the line should be 
labelled “Standard English”.  Give 
several scenarios a child talking 
to his cousin or a student 
speaking with a teacher.  Have 
children jump to the left or the 
right of the line to indicate 
whether dialect or Standard 
English is appropriate. Discuss. 
 
Intermediate:  In small groups, 
have students find pictures of 
different places (beach, airport, 
government office, etc).  Ask 
them to label two columns on 
chart paper: Use Dialect and Use 
Standard English. Have them 
glue the pictures in the 
appropriate columns.  Discuss. 
  
Advanced:  Show video 
recordings of local Bahamian 
interviews, programmes or events 
where dialect is being spoken.  
Discuss. 
Provide different 
scenarios and have 
students indicate 
where it is 
appropriate to speak 
in dialect or Standard 
English.

When speaking, ensure that others can 
understand what is being said without 
having to strain to hear.   
 
To avoid mumbling, do the following: 
 Use lips, tongue and teeth when 
speaking.   
 Pronounce the words clearly. 
 Include all of the endings. 
 Slow down your words. 
 Keep breathing so that you do 
not run out of air. 
 
The volume used when speaking, 
should be suitable for the location. It is 
necessary to be silent, whisper, talk 
quietly, speak in a medium loud voice, 
speak loudly or scream, depending on 
location and the situation. 
 
For example, when at: 
Church - silence 
Funeral Parlour - whisper or talk 
quietly                        
Hospitals - use low volume 
Supermarket - medium loud voice 
Park - loud voice 
Being attached by a robber - scream 
Basic:  Have students do 
facial exercises that will assist 
with preparing their mouths for 
speech, such as:  opening the

Environmental print is everywhere in 
our world. It is the print seen in our 
immediate surroundings / natural 
environment and used in our everyday 
lives. The print is sometimes 
recognized because of the shapes, 
pictures and colours surrounding the 
print.  
These may include the following:   
 
Street Signs              Food Items

Letters and their various patterns are 
used to represent the sounds of 
spoken language.  This is known as 
the alphabetic principle.

Phoneme segmentation is isolating  
individual sounds in a word.  Each 
individual sound can be represented 
by tapping or clapping as the sounds 
are generated. 
 
Example: 
 
The word sock has three (3) individual 
sounds. 
 
/s /o/ /ck/ 
 
The word just has four (4) individual 
sounds: 
 
/j/ /u/ /s/ /t/ 
 
---------------------------------------------- 
Basic:  Model examples of 
segmenting by cutting words 
presented on word cards/strips or 
by separating letter tiles. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
participate in a beanbag or ball 
toss. Say a word and toss the 
bag or ball to a student to have 
him or her segment the word. 
That student then tosses the bag 
or ball to another student who 
then segments another word.  
 
Advanced:  Display picture 
cards. Segment the names of 
each picture. Have students find 
the picture for the word 
segmented.

Phoneme blending is listening to a 
sequence of separately spoken 
phonemes and then combining the 
phonemes to form a word. 
 
Example:  
The sounds /f/ /a/ /s/ /t/ make the 
word fast when blended. 
 
 
Basic:  Teacher sings the 
song ‘If you think you know this 
word, shout it out!’ (Sung to the 
tune of ‘If you’re happy and 
you know it’). After singing, the 
teacher segments a word and 
allows students to say the 
blended word. 
 
Intermediate: Distribute 
picture cards to students. Ask 
them to tell how many sounds 
are in their picture name. Have 
students blend the sounds for 
classmates to guess the name 
of the picture.  
 
Advanced:  Present students 
with a list of segmented words. 
Have students with a partner, 
blend phonemes to form the 
list of words.

Phoneme substitution is changing 
one word into a new word by 
changing any one of its sounds.  
 
Example: If the /t/ sound in the 
word ‘ten’ is changed to /m/, the 
new word is ‘men’. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students display 
True or False cards to indicate 
whether or not a phoneme 
substitution took place in two 
words called.  
Example: ‘book’ and ‘took’. Allow 
students to say where the 
substitution was and identify the 
sounds substituted.  
 
Intermediate:  Show selected 
words. Have students substitute 
the beginning/medial/final 
phoneme to form a new word. Ask 
students to draw a picture to 
represent the new words formed 
when letters are substituted. This 
activity can be completed digitally 
using Google Forms, Microsoft 
forms or it can be teacher-made.   
 
Advanced: Place students in 
groups. Distribute task cards. E.g. 
Task 1: Say the word make. Now 
change the /m/ to /t/. Say the new 
word) 
Have students work in groups to

Rhyme – The same, or very similar, 
final sounds in words. 
  
Words that usually rhyme have the 
same rime.  
Example: ‘ten’ and ‘men’. 
 
However, words with different rimes 
(endings) can rhyme, like ‘ate’ and 
‘eight’. 
  
Onset is the initial consonant or 
consonant blend of the word: 
(example: the /br/ in ‘brush’). 
  
The rime is the part of a one syllable 
word that contains the vowel and 
consonants that follow it: (example: 
the ‘ush’ in ‘brush’). 
 
Basic:  Read a poem that has 
rhyming words and actions. 
Have students repeat the lines 
and do the actions. Ask 
students to identify the 
rhyming words in the poem.  
  
Intermediate: Have students 
solve riddles. In order to solve 
a riddle, the onset changes, 
but not the rime.  
Examples; The word begins 
with /b/ and rhymes with ‘fall’ 
(‘ball’).  
It begins with /r/ and rhymes 
with ‘gain’ (‘rain’).

read a book with rhyming 
words from a Dr. Seuss book 
or ‘Cap, Snap Rap Contest’

Consonants are those letters in the 
alphabet that are not vowels. 
The consonants are: b, c, d, f, g, h, 
j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, 
and z. 
  
Consonants can appear at the 
beginning, in the middle or at the 
end of words. 
  
Consonants usually represent one 
sound. However, there are some 
consonants that have two sounds, 
like ‘g’, ‘c’ and ‘x’. 
                  
 
The consonants ‘w’ and ‘y’, when 
positioned at the beginning of a 
word say their consonant sounds. 
However, when they appear in the 
medial or final positions of a word, 
they behave as vowels. 
  
 
 
 
Basic:  Place the labels (initial, 
middle, final) on the board. 
Display a picture card, give a 
consonant sound heard in the 
picture name. Have students 
stand in front of the label that 
indicates where the consonant 
sound is heard in the picture 
name.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
find pictures in magazines, 
newspapers or online with given 
consonants at the beginning, in 
the middle or at the end of 
words. Students can create a 
consonant booklet with the 
labelled pictures. 
  
Advanced:  In groups, give 
students selected consonants. 
Have students write three words 
for each consonant given. The 
consonant should appear in 
different positions in each of the 
words:  beginning, middle and 
the end.  
 
 
Call a letter and then a 
word. Have students 
write where the 
consonant sound is 
heard in the word: at the 
beginning, in the middle 
or as a final sound.

A vowel is a speech sound which is 
produced without any closure or 
blocking of the vocal tract. 
The letters, ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’ and ‘u’ are 
vowels. 
  
Short Vowels  
CVC Pattern - CVC means 
consonant – vowel- consonant.         
A vowel is usually short when it 
appears between two consonants in a 
one syllable word.   
Examples: ‘cap', ‘fit’, ‘not’ 
  
VC Pattern - VC stands for vowel – 
consonant. When a single vowel letter 
in a word or syllable is followed by a 
consonant letter, digraph, or blend, it 
usually makes its short sound. 
Examples: ‘an’, ‘it’, ‘ask’ 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
a nursery rhyme or a familiar 
song. Have them identify 
words with short vowel 
sounds. 
  
Intermediate:  Give students 
letter cards to build and read a 
word such as ‘ten.’ Then have 
them replace the vowel ‘e’ with 
‘i’ and read the new word ‘tin.’ 
Follow the same procedure to 
create additional words with 
short vowel sounds.  
  
Advanced:  Have students 
create a short vowel word / 
picture dictionary. Ask them to 
label five sheets of paper with 
the letters ‘Aa’, ‘Ee’, ‘Ii’, ‘Oo’, 
and ‘Uu’. They can draw or 
use cut-out pictures of things 
that begin with short vowel 
letters. 
 
 
Call a list of words 
containing short vowel 
sounds.  Ask students to 
write the vowel sound 
they hear in each word.

Long Vowels: 
An open phoneme (speech sound) 
in which there is no obstruction by 
the tongue, lips, or teeth of air flow.  
 
CVCE Pattern- CVCE stands for 
consonant – vowel –consonant – 
final e. In a one syllable word that 
has the CVCE pattern, the first 
vowel is usually long and the ‘e’ is 
silent.   Examples: ‘tape’, ‘five’, 
‘cove’.  
 
CVVC Pattern -Two adjacent 
vowels- When two vowels appear 
together in a word, the first vowel 
usually gives its long sound and 
the vowel that follows is silent. 
Examples: ‘seat’, ‘feet’, ‘nail/’. 
 
CV Pattern Consonant – vowel    
In a one-syllable word, the vowel 
that follows the consonant is 
usually long.   
Examples: ‘go’, ‘be’, ‘no’. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students 
participate in the activity Musical 
Chairs. Tape words with long 
vowel sounds at the back of 
chairs. Play game as usual. 
When the music stops, students 
take a seat, then rise and read 
the word taped to their chair and 
then give another word that has 
the same long vowel sound. 
  
Intermediate:  Divide the class 
into five groups. Give each group 
a vowel. Have them create about 
five CVCE words by first creating 
CVC words and adding the silent 
‘e’ at the end. Ask them to share 
the words that they created with 
the class. 
 
Advanced:  Present students 
with a list of short vowel and long 
vowel words.  Have them circle 
the long vowel words and write 
next to each of them the pattern 
that gives them their long vowel 
sounds (CVCE, CVVC and CV). 
 
Call off a list of words 
containing short or long 
vowel sounds.  Ask 
students to write the 
vowel sound they hear in 
each word and whether it 
is long or short.

Long Vowels: 
Y as a vowel 
The letter ‘y’ can sometimes have 
a vowel sound instead of a 
consonant sound.  
  
In a one syllable word the letter ‘y’ 
at the end of the word makes the 
long ‘i’ sound. 
Examples: ‘by’, ‘my’, ‘sky’ 
  
When words with more than one 
syllable end with the letter ‘y’, the 
‘y’ represents the long ‘e’ sound.    
Examples: ‘candy’, ‘happy’, ‘baby’ 
 
Basic:  Place students in a 
circle. Say words that have ‘y’ 
at the end with the long ‘’' or 
long ‘e’ sound. As words are 
said, have students clap when 
the word ends with the long ‘i’ 
sound and hop on one foot 
when they hear a word with the 
long ‘e’ sound. 
  
Intermediate:  Place three 
bags / boxes at the front of the 
room labelled ‘Y’ as a 
Consonant, ‘Y’ as Long ‘ī’ 
and ‘Y’ as Long ‘ē’. Distribute 
picture / word cards to 
students. Have students say 
their picture name / word and 
then place the picture or word 
in the correct bag or box that 
represents the sound ‘y’ is 
making in the word or picture. 
  
Advanced:  Give students 
words with ‘y’ as long ‘ē’ or 
long ‘ī’. Have them write which 
vowel sound the ‘y’ is heard as 
in each word. 
Call a list of words.  Ask 
students to write the vowel 
sound the ‘y’ is making in 
each word.

Sight words and high frequency 
words, are words that are very 
common (encountered frequently) in 
print and used in writing. 
 
 
Basic:  Play ‘musical chairs’ 
using sight words. Place word 
cards on chairs and play game 
in the usual manner. When the 
music stops, students must 
say the word on their chair 
before they sit. If child is 
unable to say the word, the 
child is out. 
 
Intermediate:  Write one letter 
per card to spell sight words. 
Create a necklace for each 
letter card. Have students 
place their letter card around 
their necks. Say a sight word. 
Students with the letters to 
spell that word should come to 
the front of the class and 
arrange themselves to spell 
the word given.  
 
Advanced:  Record given 
sentences on audio tape. Give 
students recorded sentences. 
Have students listen to tape 
and then circle the sentence 
that has the words in the same 
order as read on the tape. 
Have students read 
sentences that include 
the sight words and high 
frequency words that 
have been studied and 
that are currently being 
taught.  Build on the 
sentences as new words 
are taught.

Words are made up of parts called 
syllables. Each syllable has a vowel 
sound. Knowing about syllables helps in 
the pronunciation of words and spelling 
of words. 
 
Syllabication Rules: 
 Words with one syllable, should never 
be divided.  (Example: hand)  
 
 When one consonant appears in the 
middle of two vowels in a word, the 
syllable is usually divided after the 
consonant if the initial vowel is short. 
(Example: vis-it) 
 
 When one consonant appears 
between two vowels in a word, divide 
the word before the consonant if the 
initial vowel is long. (Example: pi-lot)  
 
 When two or more consonants 
appear between two vowels in a 
word, divide the word between the 
two consonants that are together. 
(Example: trac/tor)  
 
 Divide a compound word between the 
words that make up the compound 
word. (Example: cup-cake) 
Basic:  Give students words 
to clap out the syllables. Have 
students tell how many 
syllables are in the given 
words. 
  
Intermediate:  Divide 
students into groups.  Present 
them with about ten word 
cards and rubber bands.  
Have them work together to 
place the rubber bands 
across the place where the 
words should be divided.  
Have groups present their 
cards.  Have them identify the 
rule they were following when 
they divided the words.   
  
Advanced:  Provide students 
with a list of words.  Have 
them divide the words 
according to the syllable 
rules.  Have them use this 
information to read the words. 
 
 
 
Have students divide 
given words into 
syllables and read 
them.

Assessment 
Resources 
 
The consonants ‘c’ and ‘g’ should 
be initially introduced separately.  
 
The letter ‘c’ can be pronounced as 
/k/ or /s/.  
 
‘C’ usually makes its hard sound /k/, 
when followed by ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’. 
Example: ‘cat’  
 
‘C’ usually makes its soft sound /s/, 
when followed by ‘e’, ‘i', or ‘y’.  
Example: ‘celery’  
 
The letter ‘g’ can be pronounced as 
/g/ or /j/.  
 
‘G’ usually makes its hard sound /g/, 
when followed by ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’. 
Example: ‘goat’  
 
‘G’ usually makes its soft sound /j/, 
when followed by e, i, or y. 
Example: ‘giraffe’ 
 
 
Basic:  Label board, boxes or 
paper bags: Soft C and Hard 
C. Distribute picture or word 
cards and have students sort 
words or pictures accordingly. 
Do the same with Soft G and 
Hard G 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
play charades. Place words 
with hard and soft c and g in a 
bag. A student takes a word 
out and silently reads the 
word. The child then states 
whether the word has soft or 
hard g and acts out the word 
for the other students to guess. 
 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
read a list of words that 
contain the hard and soft c and 
g sounds. 
Present students with 
passages that contain 
hard and soft c and g 
sounds.  Have students 
take turns reading the 
passages aloud.

A consonant digraph is two 
consonants together in a word that 
produce only one speech sound. 
Consonant digraphs can be found at 
the beginning, middle and end of 
words. 
 
Examples: 
 
Beginning 
/sh/ – ship, brush 
/th/ – three, think 
/wh/ – whale, what  
/ch/ – chin, chair 
  
Middle 
/sh/ - brushing, dishes 
/ch/ - riches, teaching 
/ck/ - kicking, clocking 
/th/ - clothing 
 
End 
/ch/ - rich, lunch 
/ck/ – black, chick 
/sh/ - wish, brush 
 
 
Basic:  Collect pictures of 
various objects that have a 
digraph in the initial, medial or 
final position. Print various 
digraphs on flash cards and 
distribute to groups of 
students. Show the class a 
picture. Instruct the group that 
has the digraph found in the 
name of the picture to stand up 
and show the digraph.   
  
Intermediate:   Distribute 
digraphs in initial and final 
positions to students. Have 
them brainstorm a list of words 
for each digraph.  Create a 
word wall of digraphs.

digraphs, present them 
with sentences that 
contain words with 
digraphs that have been 
previously studied and 
those that are currently 
being studied.  Have 
them read the sentences.  
Continue to add to the 
sentences as more 
digraphs are introduced.

Silent consonants are letters that  
appear in a word but do not represent 
themselves with a spoken sound. 
  
Examples:  
In words beginning with /kn/ as in 
‘knee’, the /kn/ borrows the /n/ sound 
and the ‘k’ is silent.  
  
In words beginning with /wr/ as in 
‘write’, /wr/ borrows the /r/ sound and 
the ‘w’ is silent.

silent consonants. Ladders can 
be formed using /wr/ and /kn/ 
words.

passage containing words with 
silent consonants. Have 
students circle or underline the 
words with silent consonants.

Alphabetical order is a listing of 
names following the sequence of 
the alphabet.  
  
When alphabetizing words, the 
second and sometimes third letter 
in the name or word would have to 
be observed to correctly order 
words. 
 
 
 
Basic: Present students with a list of 
words based on a given topic 
(examples: ‘food’, ‘animals’, ‘toys’ 
etc.).  Provide students with 
Alphaboxes (boxes labelled with 
letters of the alphabet). Have 
students write/cut and paste words in 
their appropriate alpha box. 
 
Intermediate: Following a walk-a-
bout of the school grounds, have 
students create an alphabetized list 
of all of the places, people or things 
that they have observed.  
 
Advanced: Dictate a list of random 
words, have students document the 
list of words as they are called. Have 
students then alphabetize the list of 
dictated words. 
 
*Adaptation: Allow those students 
who are unable to spell the words 
from the dictated list to draw pictures 
to represent the dictated words. 
Provide support in the spelling of the 
words, in an effort to complete the 
alphabetizing of the list.     
 
Have students organize a 
word list in alphabetical 
order.

A dictionary can be a book or electronic 
resource that lists the words of a 
language (typically in alphabetical 
order) and gives their meanings.  The 
dictionary shows how to say the word, 
provides its meaning and may even use 
the word in a sentence and tell the part 
of speech.    
 
(Oxford Dictionary) 
 
Example:  ‘pigeon’ 
 
Pronunciation:  (pijon)  
 
Definition:   A bird with fat body and flat  
                   head 
 
Example Sentence: The pigeon flew  
                                 on the roof. 
Function: noun 
 
Plural form: pigeons 
 
 
Basic: Have students use a 
picture dictionary to locate 
information. 
 
Intermediate:  Play a game of 
Draw Swords. A group of 
students will stand at the back 
of the room with dictionaries 
held high; when a word is called 
the students will search the 
dictionary, find the word and 
read the meaning. Have 
particular locations identified in 
the room so that when a 
student is the first to find the 
word and read its meaning, 
he/she can advance to another 
position.  The student who 
reaches the identified “end 
position” in the room first, wins.   
 
Advanced:  Have students use 
dictionaries to complete word 
maps where students must 
document the literal meaning of 
words along with using the 
words in context.   
Have students solve 
riddles using the 
dictionary definitions of 
words.

A contraction is a shortened form of two 
words that have been placed together.  
An apostrophe (‘) is used to indicate the 
letters that have been removed.   
 
Examples:  
  
we   +   are  =  we’re  
they  +  are  =  they’re  
there  +  is   =  there’s      
I  +  have  =  I've  
you  +  are  =  you’re   
we  +  are  =  we’re   
that  +  is  =  that’s   
they  +  will  =  they’ll   
can  +  not  =  can’t  
is  +  not  =  isn’t  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:   Display a clothesline 
with contraction word cards. 
Distribute word cards for the 
contractions to students. Have 
students pin the correct cards to 
the contractions. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
complete an online game like 
“Kahoot!” where they have to 
use contractions.  
  
Advanced:  Give three to four 
sentences with word pairs that 
can be replaced with 
contractions. Have students 
rewrite the sentences using the 
contractions.

A base word is the simplest form of a 
word. It is also a word to which a prefix 
or suffix can be added to form a new 
word.  
 
Examples: ‘Tell’ and ‘happy’ are words to 
which a prefix and a suffix can be added. 
  
A prefix is a syllable added to the 
beginning of a word that changes the 
word’s meaning. 
 
Prefix Examples:  
‘re’ (prefix) + ‘tell’ (base word) = ‘retell’ 
 
The prefix ‘re’ means ‘again’.  The word 
‘retell’ means to tell again. 
 
‘un’ (prefix) + ‘happy’ (base) = ‘unhappy’ 
  
The prefix ‘un’ means ‘not’.  The word 
‘unhappy’ means not happy. 
 
A suffix is a syllable joined to the end of 
a word that changes its definition. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Write base words with 
prefixes on cards. Cut words 
between the base word and 
the prefix. Give each student a 
card. Have students walk 
around the room and find their 
match / partner. Have partners 
stand together and share their 
word once everyone has 
found his / her match. 
 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
sort words as base words, 
prefixes and suffixes. 
 
Advanced:  Using a 
worksheet, have students 
match prefix and base word 
with their combined meanings.  
They can do the same with 
suffixes. 
Have students create 
words using cards with 
base words, prefixes and 
suffixes.

Suffix Examples: 
‘Quick’ and ‘care’ are examples of words 
to which a suffix can be added. 
 
The suffix ‘ly’ tells how something is 
being done.   
 
‘quick’ (base word) + ‘ly’ (suffix) = 
‘quickly 
  
This means that something happened 
very fast. 
 
The suffix ‘ful’ can sometimes tell how 
something is being tended to. 
 
‘care’ (base word) + ‘ful’ (suffix) = 
‘careful’ 
 
This means that measures are being 
taken to be safe and to protect.

Objective:   2.30   Add inflectional endings (with or without) spelling changes. 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
An inflectional ending is a letter or group 
of letters added to a base word to change 
its meaning. 
-ing 
The ending ‘ing’ tells about something 
that is happening now. 
e.g. The birds are singing. 
  
-ed 
When ‘ed’ is added to the end of a word it 
tells of something that happened in the 
past. 
 e.g. The girl jumped over the rope. 
 
Whenever a short vowel word ends with 
one consonant, the last consonant is 
usually doubled before adding an ending 
that begins with a vowel. (examples: -ed / 
-ing). 
Example: hop 
hopped   hopping 
 
In a one syllable word with a long vowel 
sound and a final ‘e’, the final ‘e’ is 
dropped before adding the ending –ing. 
Examples: 
save  - save - saving 
make – make - making 
Basic:  Distribute cards that 
contain words with inflectional 
endings. Ask students to say 
their word, tell what 
inflectional ending is added 
and what it means. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
read a passage with words 
with inflectional endings. Ask 
students to underline the 
words, then, sort words 
underlined using headings: 
Now / Past. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students 
with a list of base words in 
one column and the 
inflectional ending to be 
added in another column.  In 
the third column have 
students combine the two 
using the rules provided, to 
produce the correct spelling.   
Dictate sentences to 
students with words that 
have inflectional endings.  
Assess their spelling of 
these words.

There are specific punctuation marks 
that give cues as to how a particular 
sentence should be read. 
 
Period/Full Stop – Pause and take a 
breath before reading the next 
sentence. 
Example: Today is the first day of 
school.  I just made two new friends. 
 
Comma – Give a slight pause after the 
comma.  Reading too fast or too slowly 
can change the meaning of a sentence. 
Example:. Ms. Smith, my new teacher, 
sent me to the office to get some paper. 
 
Question Mark – Raise your voice at 
the end of a sentence, when there is a 
question mark. This indicates that a 
response may be required. 
Example: Do you like your new school?

have students identify the 
common punctuation 
marks/signals and state what 
they mean.

It is important when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at which 
you are reading, the rise and fall of your 
voice and expression. 
 
Pace – Refers to how fast or how 
slowly someone is speaking.  Be 
careful not to speak so slowly that 
listeners lose interest. Do not read too 
quickly, otherwise the words may not 
be clear and the listeners may find it 
difficult to follow. 
 
Intonation – The rise and fall of the 
voice to reflect what is happening in the 
reading piece. 
 
Vocal Expression – The tone of the 
reader should reflect the mood of the 
piece.  
Examples: 
Sad Mood - Read slowly, lower the 
voice. 
Angry Mood – Loud, booming voice 
Happy Mood – Light, medium fast voice  
 
Pitch of Voice - Refers to the loudness 
or softness of the voice. 
Basic:   Have students listen to 
a radio drama.  Have them 
discuss the pace, intonations 
and vocal expressions utilized 
by the actors. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide 
students with the same 
sentence to read.  Place 
different emotions on slips of 
paper in a bag.  Have students 
take turns selecting a slip.  
Have them read the line in such 
a way as to portray that 
emotion.  They should use 
intonations, variations in pace 
and expression to capture the 
mood.  Have students identify 
the mood that is being 
portrayed. 
 
Advanced:  Have students take 
turns reading a passage.  
Remind them to pay attention to 
the pacing and their 
expressions.  Allow students to 
give feedback on their reading. 
Have students complete a 
fluency assessment.  Use 
a rubric to score their 
efforts.

In order to make stories interesting, 
authors include characters, setting, 
plot and a theme.  These are 
called story elements. 
 
Character: The people or animals 
in a story are the characters. 
Stories can tell what characters 
look like, what they think, how they 
feel and what they say and do. 
 
Setting: Where a story takes place 
and the time of day that it takes 
place, is called the setting. The 
setting can be a real or a make-
believe place. 
  
Plot: The plot has a beginning, 
middle, and end. It is usually made 
up of the most important events of 
the story. Short stories usually 
have one plot or event. 
 
Theme(s): The theme is the main 
message. 
Basic:  Select students to act as 
characters for an interview during a talk 
show. The host of the talk show can ask 
the characters questions such as:  
1. Who are you?     
2. What did you do? 
3. Where were you when you did it? 
4. What were some of the important things that  
    happened? 
  
Intermediate:  Have students read a text 
at the appropriate reading level.  
Construct a visual diagram and have 
students record the elements of the story 
on the diagram in a group, in pairs or 
individually. 
 Who?    Did What?   When?  
 Where?   How?       Why? 
  
Advanced: Have students work in pairs 
to identify the elements of a story. 
Setting: Tell where the story takes place. 
Character(s): Tell the names of the 
characters and if they are good, bad, 
helpful, mean, funny, etc. 
Problem: Tell what the problem is. 
Solution: Tell how the problem was 
solved. 
 
Read a story and 
have students 
identify the various 
story elements.

Context clues help the reader figure out 
the meaning of unfamiliar words while 
reading. Context clues may be in the 
same sentence as the unknown words.  
There are several ways to figure out 
their meanings. 
 
1. Examples – Clues about the 
meanings of words can be found in 
the examples that are given 
following the unfamiliar words. The 
word is often followed by “like” or 
“such as”.   
Example:  Insects, like ants or flies, 
                 like to be near food.  
 
2. Synonyms – Sometimes authors 
use words that are similar in 
meaning to the unfamiliar words to 
explain them. 
      Example:  The dense fog was thick  
                       and heavy. 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students read 
rebus sentences where 
examples and synonym clues 
are provided. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
read sentences where example 
clues are given.  Have them 
use this information to explain 
the meanings of the words. 
 
Advanced: Have students read 
sentences that utilize examples 
and synonyms as context clues.  
Have them use these clues to 
explain the meanings of the 
words. 
 
Have students complete a 
worksheet where they 
have to use the clues 
provided in order to 
understand the meaning 
of unfamiliar words.

When making predictions, think about 
clues the author has given, along with 
what you already know, to make a good 
guess as to what will happen next.  
Predictions may change as new 
information is provided. 
 
 
Basic:  Show pictures of a child 
doing something naughty like 
walking in puddles with his 
good shoes.  Have students 
predict what will happen when 
the child gets home.  Have 
students give reasons for their 
responses.  Relate this to 
making predictions when we 
read.

The main idea of a paragraph is the 
one idea to which all the other 
sentences in that paragraph are 
related.  Having a main idea helps 
to keep the paragraph organized. 
The sentences which tell about the 
main idea are called detail 
sentences. 
 
Basic:  Explain to students that at 
home, at school or in an office, 
properly kept files help to keep 
things organized.  Tell them that 
they are going to help you file 
things away.  Give students the 
names of five (5) folders. For 
example, My Family, School, 
Recipes.  etc. Have students place 
items in the correct folders. Relate 
this to the function of the Main Idea

When reading or writing paragraphs 
and stories, events must be placed 
in the correct order to understand 
what is being read.   We refer to this 
as the sequence of events. 
  
The sequence of events is also 
important when following directions.  
When we follow a recipe, for 
example, we need to follow the steps 
so that the item we are making is 
done correctly. 
  
Clue words such as first, next, 
then, after that, and last help the 
reader to understand the order in 
which certain events happened.   
  
Words such as morning, night and 
evening also tell the order in which 
events happened. 
Basic:  Place sentences from a nursery 
rhyme on sentence strips.  Have 
students place them in the correct 
order. 
  
Intermediate:  Gather comic strips from 
a newspaper. Cut them apart.  Glue the 
separate panels on a stiffer piece of 
paper, then laminate.  
(Put the correct number on the back of 
each piece to show sequence.)  
Have students take turns putting the 
panels in the correct order. 
  
Advanced: Place footprints around the 
classroom at designated spots, for 
example: next to supplies that have 
been knocked off a desk, a desk that 
has been tipped over and next to a book 
in the reading corner.     
Have students follow the footprints and 
observe what took place at each stop. 
Ask students to write about the order in 
which the person moved around the 
classroom, using sequencing words. 
 
 
Have students read a 
simple story.  Have 
students number 
sentences to indicate 
the order in which the 
events took place in 
the story.

Authors sometimes use their 
imaginations to help them write 
interesting stories.  Stories about 
fairies, talking animals and objects 
are not real.  We call these types of 
stories make-believe or fiction. 
  
Books that give us information about 
a person’s life, things that actually 
happened and places that people can 
actually go and visit are considered 
real life or non-fiction. 
 
 
Basic:   Read various scenarios. 
Have the children hold up an ‘M’ 
card for Make-believe and an ‘R’ 
card for Real Life. The teacher 
can ask individual students to 
explain why they held up the 
cards that they did. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
work in pairs or a group to read a 
given passage.  Have them 
determine whether the passage is 
fiction or non-fiction.  Give 
students an opportunity to explain 
their reasoning. 
  
Advanced:  Have students write 
statements that are fiction or non-
fiction.  Place them in a bag.  
Have students take turns

A fact is a statement that can be proven 
true or false.  This may be done 
through further reading or by asking an 
adult. 
 
Example: 
Christmas Day is on a Monday this 
year. 
 
This is a statement of fact.  It can be 
proven true or false by checking the 
calendar.   
 
An opinion tells how someone thinks or 
feels about a particular topic.  As a 
result, it cannot be proven true or false. 
 
Words that tell how someone feels 
such as thinks or likes, can be used to 
tell opinions.   
 
Example:  Cookies and Cream is the 
best ice cream in the world. 
 
This is an opinion because it expresses 
how this person feels about Cookies 
and Cream ice cream. 
 
Basic: Read a variety of 
sentences. Have the students 
display the ‘F’ card for Fact and 
the ‘O’ card for Opinion. The 
teacher can call on individual 
students to explain why they held 
up the card that they did. 
  
Intermediate:  During guided 
reading, have students go on a 
fact hunt. As they find the facts, 
they can list them on a group 
chart. Each group can then share 
their facts with the class.   
  
Advanced: Have each individual 
select five sentences from a bag 
from the centre of their group.  
Provide them with a Fact and 
Opinion chart. Have them write the 
sentences in the correct column. 
In the third column, ask them to 
explain the reason for their 
answer. 
 
 
Provide students with a 
worksheet where they 
have to determine 
whether or not 
statements are factual 
or statements of 
opinions.

small groups.  Give each group 
a bag.  Each bag should have 
items related to a particular 
sport.  Example: ‘bat’, ‘ball’, 
‘uniform’, etc.  Have students 
use the clues to guess the 
sport.  (If actual items cannot be 
located, pictures can also be 
used.)

experiences to decide if something is 
right/wrong, good/bad, 
pleasant/unpleasant or fair/unfair. 
 
 
Basic: Discuss issues relevant 
to classroom life with students 
such as the fairness or 
unfairness of students jumping 
the line, a bully taking 
someone’s lunch money etc.  
Connect this to making 
judgments when reading.

 Explain commonly used proverbs.  
Content

Resources 
 
A proverb is a common saying or 
phrase that is used to give advice or 
explain what is believed to be true, 
based on experience.  Some common 
proverbs are: 
 
Actions speak louder than words. 
People watch what we do more than 
listen to what we say.   
 
Idle hands are the Devil’s workshop. 
If we do not keep ourselves busy, then 
we might easily get into trouble. 
 
A stitch in time saves nine. 
We should deal with problems and 
issues right away so that they do not 
build up and become difficult to handle. 
 
Don’t judge a book by its cover. 
Some books may not have a very 
appealing cover but they can still be 
very interesting.  Sometimes we miss 
out on knowing people and 
opportunities because they may not 
appear to be interesting at first.  We 
should avoid doing this. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students discuss an 
event that happened in their lives 
when one of the proverbs might 
have applied. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
match the proverbs with certain 
fairy tales or other stories. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
Aesop’s Fables and discuss the 
meaning of the proverbs.  Have 
them identify other stories to which 
the proverbs might apply. 
 
Have students match 
specific proverbs with 
situations presented.  
Have them explain why 
they paired the two.

A sentence is a group of words that 
express a complete idea or 
thought.    
Example: We like to play in the 
park.  
 
Sentences should begin with a 
capital letter and end with an end 
mark. There are three different end 
marks: period (.), question mark (?) 
and exclamation point/mark (!). 
 
A fragment is a group of words that 
do not express a complete thought, 
although the first word might be 
capitalized and a punctuation mark 
follows at the end.   
Example: The day he came

Resources 
 
There are four types of sentences.  
A statement, called a telling 
sentence, tells something. The end 
mark used for telling sentences is the 
period/full stop (.). 
Example:  I live in a green house. 
 
A question, called an asking 
sentence, asks something. Questions 
end with a question mark (?).  
Questions usually begin with special 
words such as: would, should, why, 
who, what, when, where, how, is, are 
and will. 
Example:  What is the colour of your 
house? 
 
An exclamatory sentence shows 
strong feelings. It begins with a capital 
letter and ends with an exclamation 
point(!) . 
Example:  Yikes, I lost my homework 
again! 
 
A command sentence gives an order. 
It ends with a period/full stop. 
Example: Give Nate his pencil. 
Basic:  Have students play the 
game, “Tag that Sentence”.  
Read various types of 
sentences and then have 
students raise their hashtag 
cards to indicate the type of 
sentence read.  
Example: Would you be more 
comfortable on the couch? 
  #statement             
#question 
 
Intermediate:  In pairs, have 
students dictate and record

A run-on sentence is made up of two 
or more sentences that have been 
joined incorrectly. These types of 
sentences can sometimes go on and 
on.  
 
Example: 
Byron got up late he missed the bus. 
 
Run-on sentences can be corrected 
by placing the conjunction and between 
the sentences. 
 
Byron got up late and he missed the 
bus.  
 
Run-on sentences can also be 
corrected by separating them into two 
different sentences.  
 
Byron got up late. He missed the bus. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students take 
turns picking a sentence from a 
bag. Have them tell if the 
sentence is a run-on sentence. 
 
Intermediate: Using sentence 
strips, have students add 
punctuation marks and capital 
letters in the run-on sentence in 
order to make it two sentences. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
complete a worksheet where 
they will have to correct run-on 
sentences.   
Have students divide run-
on sentences into simple 
sentences by inserting 
periods and capital letters 
at the correct points in the 
run-on sentences.

Nouns, also called naming words, 
are words that name a person, place, 
animal or thing.  
 
Common nouns do not name a 
particular person, place, animal or 
thing. 
Examples: 
Person:   father 
Place:      island 
Animal:   bird          
Thing:     airplane 
 
Proper nouns name a special 
person, place, animal or thing. Proper 
nouns begin with a capital letter. 
Days of the week, months of the year 
and holidays are proper nouns. 
Examples: 
Person:   Sam Kemp 
Place:      Inagua 
Animal:   Polly          
Thing:     Bahamasair 
 
 
 
 
Basic: Students will play a game 
called Concentration. In this 
game, each student will give a 
noun for the selected category 
when called upon.  
Example: 
Name of a person = Mary 
Name of a place = Nassau  
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
play the game Noun Storm.  
When given a particular letter, 
students will have ten seconds to 
brainstorm as many nouns as 
they can think of that begin with 
that letter.     
 
Advanced:  Students will work in 
groups of four to identify nouns in 
a poem or another kind of writing. 
They will state if they are 
common or proper nouns.   
Have students circle the 
nouns in a given list of 
sentences.  Have 
students determine if the 
circled nouns are 
common or proper nouns.

A singular noun names one person, 
place, animal or thing. 
Nouns that name two or more people, 
places, animals or things are called 
plural nouns. 
Some nouns add ‘s’ to name more than 
one.  
 
Add ‘es’ to words that end with: ‘ch’, 
‘sh’, ‘ss’, ‘x’ and  ‘z’ to name more 
than one person, place, animal or thing. 
 
Examples: 
witch       witches 
bush        bushes 
glass       glasses 
box          boxes 
quiz         quizzes 
Basic:  Have students compile 
and illustrate a book that 
contains singular and plural 
nouns.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
play the game, “Teacher May 
I?”.  For this game, give 
students different nouns.  Have 
them decide whether to 
add ‘s’ or ‘es’ to the noun to 
form the plural name.  Students 
will then ask, “Teacher may I?”  
Once the teacher says, “Yes, 
you may” students will proceed 
to write the noun on the board 
and add the appropriate 
ending.  
Examples: 
book = books  
fox = foxes.  
  
Advanced:  Have students 
match the singular nouns with 
the correct plural nouns. Have 
students write sentences using 
the plural forms of the nouns.   
 
Have students illustrate 
then write sentences 
about each picture to 
show one or more than 
one.

A possessive noun shows ownership. 
 
Most singular possessive nouns are 
formed by adding an apostrophe (‘) 
and the letter ‘s’ to the noun. 
 
Example: The horse’s tail is black. 
 
If a plural noun ends with the letter ‘s’, 
the possessive noun is formed by 
adding only an apostrophe (‘) after 
the ‘s’. 
 
Example:  These are the girls’ dolls.

Pronouns are words that are used 
in place of nouns. The words ‘I’, 
‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘they’, ‘we’, ‘our’, 
‘us’, and ‘it’ are examples of 
pronouns. 
 
Example: 
Mary and Jan like ice-cream. 
They like ice-cream. 
The pronoun ‘they’ replaces the 
nouns Mary and Jan. 
 
Use ‘I’ and ‘me’ to talk about 
yourself.  ‘I’ is always capitalized 
when it stands alone as a word.  
When talking about yourself and 
someone else, always say the 
other person’s name first. 
Example: 
Jerry and I are going to the park.  
 
The pronoun ‘me’ is used after an 
action verb.

The lizards jumped on Jan and 
me.

A word that shows action is called a 
verb and is sometimes referred to as 
an action word.  
Examples: jump, jog, hit, swim 
 
Some verbs help the action verb or 
main verb by telling when something 
happened. They are called helping 
verbs.  Helping verbs can be singular 
or plural. 
 
Singular             Plural 
is                          are 
was                      were 
am 
has                       have 
had 
does                     do 
 
The helping verb ‘have’ is used with the 
pronouns ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’ and ‘they’.  
 
Personal Singular 
‘I’  
Use ‘am’ when the subject is ‘I’, in the 
present tense.  
 
Singular Pronouns 
‘he’, ‘she’ and ‘it’  
Use ‘is’ when the subject is a singular  
Basic:  Have students listen to a 
poem and follow the instructions to 
complete the actions. Ask them to 
identify action verbs from the poem.  
Example: 
Hands 
I have two hands that clap and tap 
When I’m tired, I lay them in my 
lap. 
My hands bend, wave and clip, 
They can use scissors to snip, snip, 
snip

Intermediate:  Have students play 
Word Theatre. Place verbs in a 
bag. Have a student blindly select a 
word from the bag and then 
demonstrate/act-out the verb 
chosen without any spoken cues. 
Another student will guess the verb 
being demonstrated until the 
correct word is called.

There are special ways to say or write 
verbs to tell when something happens.  
For actions that are happening now, the 
present tense is used. For actions that 
have already happened, the past tense 
is used. For actions that are still to 
happen the future tense is used.  
 
Present Tense: 
If the noun is singular (representing one) 
an ‘s’ is added to the verb. 
Example: Ben sings in church.  
When using the pronouns, ‘he’, ‘she’ and 
‘it’, add an ‘s’ to the verb to indicate the 
present tense.  
Example: She jumps into the water. 
 
If the noun is plural, no ‘s’ is added to 
the verb.      
Example: They jump into the water.    
 
Present Tense      
The suffix,‘ing’ can also be added to a 
verb to tell that something is happening 
now.   
Example: Jan is playing in the band. 
 
 
Basic: On the chart provided, fill in 
the missing form of the verb.  
 
Subject 
Present Tense 
Past Tense 
Ryann

Intermediate: Present students with 
sentence strips and three clothespins 
labelled ‘s’, ‘ed’ and ‘ing’. Have 
students add the appropriate ending 
to the verb in each sentence. 
 
Advanced:  Present students with a 
group of sentences on a worksheet. 
Have students provide the correct 
tense of the verb to make the 
sentence complete. 
 
Example: Sarah ____ through the 
window. 
Verb: jump 
Have students work 
individually to 
complete sentences 
using the correct 
verb tense.

are used to tell how something 
looks, feels, tastes, sounds or 
smells.

When writing, how the story or piece 
begins is very important.  The writer 
should try to grab the attention of the 
person who is reading the piece right 
away. This can be done in several 
ways. 
 
 Begin with a question.  Have you 
ever fallen out of bed? 
 
 Start with lots of action.  Mr. Rolle 
held tightly on to his line.  Suddenly, 
the fish gave a big jerk and pulled 
the line out of Mr. Rolle’s hands. 
 
 Use sound words.  Clip-clop, clip-
clop went the horse as it pulled the 
carriage filled with tourist down 
Shirley Street. 
 
 Begin with words that sound 
alike.  Hungry, hot and hurt, the 
man sat quietly on the rock 
 
 
Basic:  Have students make a 
collection of sound words that 
they can easily access when 
they are writing.  Have them 
draw a picture on one side of 
the card and the word 
representing the sound made, 
on the other side of the card. 
Ask leading questions like, 
“What does the duck say?”  
Have them select an 
appropriate sound word to 
begin a piece of writing.  
 
Intermediate:  Ask students to 
write about the Needs of Living 
Things or another Social 
Science topic.  Have them 
begin the piece with a question. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
watch a movie clip that begins 
with a lot of action.  Have them 
capture the beginning in their 
writing. 
 
Have students write a 
paragraph with an 
interesting introduction.

When writing, it is important to 
sound interested in what is being 
written.   
 
Stories should be written like they 
are being told to a friend. Be funny 
if it suits what is being said.  If it is 
something sad being said, use 
words that would make the reader 
feel sad. 
 
Be as detailed as possible.  Be 
sure to use the senses in 
describing people, places and 
things.   
 
Be clear when writing.  Give good 
explanations when sharing the 
steps to complete something. 
 
Give strong reasons to support 
any opinions you are sharing.  
Keep it serious so that the reader 
pays attention to what is being 
said. 
 
 
 
Basic:   Have students sing and 
demonstrate the “Voice Song” (sung 
to the tune of “If You’re Happy and 
You Know It”).  Use the reference 
below or write your own.

Classroom K-2 p. 57 
 
Intermediate: Give students a line of 
text to read and a descriptor. Ask 
student to read the line out loud in 
that voice. Let the other students 
guess the voice or a synonym for it.    
 
Advanced:  Have students select an 
emoticon out of a bag.  Have them 
write sentences/paragraph to reflect 
that emotion.  Have them share their 
writing.  Ask the students to 
determine the emoticon that had 
been selected. 
 
Have students complete a 
piece of writing.  Assess it 
using a rubric for the 
Voice trait.

Many people can tell the same story 
about an experience but it will be 
different for each of them because they 
all looked at what happened in different 
ways. 
 
Use words such as: ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’ and 
‘we’ to tell a story about you. 
 
Use words such as: ‘you’ and ‘yours’ to 
tell the story as if someone else is 
watching what happens. 
 
Use ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’ and’ they’ when you 
are watching the story unfold. 
 
Sometimes the writer can pretend to be 
an animal or object to tell their side of 
the story. 
 
 
Basic:  Have a student hold a 
camera in front and video tape 
himself walking along the 
sidewalk.  Then have another 
student videotape him walking 
down the same sidewalk.  
Share both views with the class.  
Discuss any similarities and 
differences.  Relate it to writing. 
 
Intermediate:  Read the Seven 
Blind Mice by Ed Young or a 
similar story.  The Mice 
discover something mysterious 
by the pond.  Each feels a 
different part of the object and 
comes up with his own theory 
as to what it is.  Relate this to 
having different viewpoints in 
writing. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
imagine that they are a mango 
tree with lots of mangoes next 
door to a school. Ask them to 
write about the experiences that 
the tree would have. 
 
 
Have students complete a 
piece of writing from a 
specific perspective.  Use 
a rubric to assess their 
writing.

Poems are a fun way of expressing our 
ideas and thoughts.  They can come in 
many different forms.  
Rhyming Poems  
In rhyming poems, the words at the end 
of line pairs rhyme. There should be 
about the same number of words in the 
line pairs that rhyme so that the flow of 
the poem is consistent.  
  
Cinquains  
The Cinquain (/ˈsɪŋkeɪn/ is a five-line 
poem. Each line has a specific number 
of words as well as type of words.  
Line One –    1 word (noun)  
Line Two –    2 words (adjectives that   
                      describe the noun in line 1)  
Line Three – 3 words (action)  
Line Four –   4 words (longer description)  
Line Five –    1 word (noun that relates to the  
                      noun in line 1)  
 
List Poems  
List poems are written as lists.  They 
may simply have a list of words or there 
may be a common phrase in each 
line.  All of the lines refer to the person 
or thing that the poem is about.  
 
Basic:  Have students make a 
class poem.  The teacher can 
provide the stem of the poem 
and have students provide the 
rhyming words at the end.  
Intermediate: Provide students 
with stimulating pictures such 
as a delicious chocolate cake or 
an ice cream topped with a 
variety of toppings.  Have 
them write a Cinquain poem 
about the picture.  
Advanced:   Have 
students write a list poem about 
a current Science or Social 
Studies topic.  
 
Have students write a 
poem.  Use a rubric to

Writing stories is a way of telling about 
something that happened.  Stories 
should have a beginning, middle and 
an end.   
 
Stories should tell about animals or 
people that are included in the events. 
These are called story characters.  
What did they say?  How did they look?  
Where did they go? 
 
Stories should also give an idea of 
where the events are happening...in 
school? at the fair? on Crooked Island?  
This is called the setting or the place 
where the stories are taking place. 
 
Stories should give a problem and 
explain how it is solved.  This is called 
the plot. 
 
 
Basic: Have students listen to a 
simple song that tells a story.  
Have them identify the 
characters, setting and plot.   
 
Intermediate:  Ask students to 
write a story about a big 
surprise.  Have students first 
draw pictures of the characters 
in their stories.  Have them use 
details from their pictures to tell 
more about the characters in 
their writing pieces. 
 
Advanced:  Have students look 
at pictures from a magazine, 
calendar or on the internet to 
pick a setting for their stories.  
Let them take a little time to 
write about what it looks like.  
Have them incorporate these 
descriptions in their stories.

In descriptive writing it is important to 
describe people, animals, places, 
items etc. in such detail that readers 
can picture them in their minds as 
they read.  
Using the senses to help build 
descriptions is key.  Include what you 
can see, feel, taste, smell or hear.  
Comparing one thing to another is 
another way of helping with 
descriptions.  
Example; The dog’s bark was as 
sharp as a whistle. 
 
 
Basic: Select a simple paragraph 
that is particularly rich in sensory 
detail. Present a copy of the 
paragraph to each child. Read 
through the paragraph together 
and have the students identify 
(circle) the describing words. 
  
Intermediate: Select a simple 
paragraph from a basal reader. 
Create a cloze paragraph by 
adding or leaving blank spaces 
where adjectives were or could be 
added. Have the students read 
and then write their own describing 
words to complete the paragraph. 
  
Advanced:  Give each child a 
paragraph frame with a topic 
sentence describing an animal or 
thing.  Examples: My dog is very 
funny. or Oranges are very juicy. 
Have the students write two or 
three more descriptive sentences 
to support the topic sentence. 
 
 
Have students write a 
descriptive piece.  Use a 
rubric to assess.

In addition to writing stories and 
describing events or people, there is a 
type of writing that just gives directions 
or provides information. We call this 
type of writing, expository writing.  
 
Examples of expository writing are: 
 
 Classroom Rules 
 Textbooks 
 Instructions 
 Book Reports 
 Recipes 
 Flyers 
 Invitations 
 
When explaining how to do something, 
begin with a sentence that tells what 
you will be writing about. Use sequence 
words to help order the steps. End with 
a sentence that tells what was just 
done, but in another way. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
examples of expository writing 
from the radio.  Discuss their 
purpose.  Have students 
identify examples of expository 
writing in their environment. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide 
students with excerpts from 
narrative, descriptive and 
expository pieces.  Have them 
identify the expository ones. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
write information about their 
school to share with a friend 
who is interested in attending. 
 
 
 
Have students write an 
expository piece.  Use a

Friendly letters are written to provide our 
family and friends information about what is 
happening in our lives. Friendly letters 
should include:  
The Heading - This includes the date. It is 
normally written in the right-hand corner and 
tells when the letter was written.  
Salutation or Greeting - This is the way to 
identify the person to whom you are writing.  
It usually begins with “Dear” and is written 
on the left side of the paper. 
The Body of the Letter – This is considered 
the main part of the letter where you may 
include all of the interesting details about 
your family and friends and write about what 
you have been doing, your hobbies etc.   
The Closing – This is a way of ending the 
letter or signing off.  “Love” and “Your best 
friend” are examples that are used.  The first 
word in the closing is always capitalized.  
Signature – This identifies by name the 
person who is writing the letter. 
 
Basic:  Present students with a 
chart showing a friendly letter.  
Have the names for different 
parts of a friendly letter written 
on small cards.  Using velcro or 
tape, have students place them 
on the correct parts.

The Reading Block 
 
The Reading Block for lower primary refers to the 90-minute double period dedicated exclusively for the teaching of 
reading.  This daily instructional block encourages the integration of the five components of reading: phonemic 
awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension.  Within this block, time should be allocated for guided 
reading, where teachers hear students read in small groups as well as individually.   
 
Useful Information about the Teaching of Reading 
 
 
READING LEVELS 
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% 
comprehension rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the 
information with at least 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate. 
 
 
Basal Readers 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-leveled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-
appropriate reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, 
comprehension skills and vocabulary skills.

Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
  
The Language Experience Approach 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on 
the board or on chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the 
language arts components (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and helps the children to see relationships: “What I 
can think about, I can talk about. What I can say, I can read. What I can read, I can write.” 
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Guided Reading: 
Guided Reading refers to teachers working with students in small groups to provide support in reading and 
comprehending designated texts.     
 
Oral Reading: 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
As the teacher listens to and observes the students read orally, the checklist can be used as guide to assess students’ 
oral reading abilities. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The 
checklist also helps the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.

Sample Checklist for Oral Reading 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings in relation to the content subjects and 
daily living experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in 
Social Studies, Science and Arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, 
the more demand for reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for 
pleasure. Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  Lifetime interest 
in good books comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational 
reading, the teacher must know children’s books, know the students’ ability and interests and be ready to help students 
find the right books at the right time.  Students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide 
gradation of difficulty that can be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting 
classroom libraries and encourage students to visit their school libraries.

Important Phonics Rules 
  
 
1. The letter ‘c’ has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /k/ or /s/.  It is pronounced /k/ when it is followed by a, o or 
u as in words like ‘can’, ‘cough’ and ‘cut’.  ‘C’ makes its soft sound /s/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words 
like ‘cent’, ‘city’ and ‘cycle’. 
 
2. The letter ‘g’ has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /g/ or /j/.  It makes its hard sound /g/ when it is followed by 
a, o or u as in words like ‘gate’, ‘goat’ or ‘got’.  ‘G’ makes its soft sound /j/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in 
words like ‘gem’, ‘gills’ or ‘gym’.  There are some exceptions to this rule as in words like ‘get’, ‘give’ and ‘gift’. 
 
3. The CVC pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel and then another consonant.  When 
this happens, the vowel usually gives its shorts sound.  Examples are words like ‘bed’, ‘man’ and ‘hat’.  
 
4. The Final ‘e’ or CVCE pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel, another consonant and 
a final e.  In instances where this occurs, the first vowel gives its long sound (says its name) and the e is silent.  
Examples of words that follow this pattern are ‘made’, ‘hole’, ‘cube’ and ‘date’. 
 
5. The CV pattern refers to words that only have one syllable.  In these two-letter words, the vowel normally gives its 
long sound as in words like ‘go’ and ‘me’.  Some one-syllable words do not follow this pattern as in words like ‘to’ 
and ‘do’. 
 
6. R-Controlled vowels refer to vowels that are followed by the letter ‘r’.  When this happens, the sound of the ‘r’ 
usually dominates the vowel sound, and the sound that the vowel makes is neither a short or a long sound.  Words 
like ‘cart’, ‘far’ and ‘for’ are examples of the r-controlled sounds. 
 
7. When ‘gh’ follows ‘i’, the ‘i’ gives its long sound and the ‘gh’ is silent.  ‘Thigh’ and ‘right’ are examples of this rule. 
 
8. In words that begin with ‘kn’ and ‘wr’, only the sound for the second letter is heard.  In the words ‘knot’ and ‘wreck’ 
the ‘n’ and ‘r’ sounds are heard. 
                                                                                                                                                    Adapted from Language Arts by Gail Tompkins

Vowel Generalizations 
 
The following are some of the most common vowel generalizations. 
 
a. In one syllable words containing two vowel letters (one of which is a final e) the first vowel usually represents a long 
vowel sound, the e is silent. (e.g. kite, bite). 
b. In a one-syllable word that ends with a vowel, the vowel that follows the consonant is usually long (e.g. he, go – 
open syllable). 
c. A vowel is usually short when it appears between two consonants in a one-syllable word (e.g. hat, fox, dig – closed 
syllable). 
d. When i is followed by gh, nd,  or ld, the i usually represents its long sound (e.g. find, child, light). 
e. The vowel o followed by –ld usually has a long sound (e.g. old).  
f. If the only vowel in a word or syllable is an a followed by w, ll and u, the sound of the a is usually that of a short o 
(e.g. wall).  
g. When two vowels appear together in a word, the first vowel usually gives its long sound and the vowel that follows 
is silent. This rule is usually consistent with ai, oa, ee and ay combinations. 
h. Each vowel letter may represent the soft schwa sound often heard in the unaccented syllable (e.g. disappear, 
telegram). 
Y functions as a vowel when it concludes words of more than one syllable (e.g. dad/dy) and it follows a vowel (e.g.)

Writing Instruction 
 
Daily Written Composition 
The timetable for the Lower Primary Grades provides daily periods for Written Composition instruction with a total of five 
(5) periods weekly.  In some instances, a daily allotment of 30 minutes for written composition may not be feasible; hence, 
the time allotment for instruction is five periods per week.  According to research and best practices being currently used, 
composition writing should follow a balanced literacy approach.    
 
Instructional Strategy: 10 Day Writing Plan   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
The “Ten Day Writing Plan” is a pilot writing model developed to support the daily teaching of written composition. This 
plan can be adapted for use at all primary grades.  It is research based and contains the following components of good 
writing instruction: 
 
· Mentor Texts 
· Enriching Experiences to Build Background Knowledge 
· Vocabulary Building Activities 
· The Writing Process 
· Writing Instructional Strategies 
- Modelled Writing 
- Interactive Writing 
 
The W.A.V.E is an acronym that is used to indicate what should be included a good piece of writing.  The letters refer to: 
Wonderful Introduction 
Add a Topic Sentence 
Very Specific Details 
Exciting Ending

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 –  2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 


xi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection. 
 
MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS GRADES 1 – 12 
A DISCUSSION 


xii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example, Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics. 
 
Concepts 
 
 
 
Scheme or plan for Mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and fractions,  
 
Content Standards   
            Cover what students are to learn in various subject areas, such as Mathematics and Science.  
 
Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three.

The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


xvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

BENCHMARKS: GRADES 1 - 3

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at  
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended. 
 
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE 


xxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.  
 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 


xxii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested. 
BEST PRACTICES IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS 


xxv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1 - 6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students. 
 
 Teach to the needs of each group of students during guided mathematics activities. 
 
 Integrate mathematics across the curriculum. 
 
 Give tests at the end of a concept or unit.  This will identify students learning and the effectiveness of teacher strategies/practices. 
 
 Give post-test at the end of the school year to determine students’ successes.  
 
 Record results from the assessments in teachers’ Mark Book, portfolios, and formal reports. 
 
 Host Mathematics competitions to give students the opportunity to compete with their peers and solidify skills and concepts taught. 
 
 Teacher training/upgrading in mathematics instruction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 


xxvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 
Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES 


xxvii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
 
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of comprehension than those under Understand. 
 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 
Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
 putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
 production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three distracters.  
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, 
or a multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical thinking 
skills.  Furthermore, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in working with 
timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various components of the 
examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques and timed tests/ 
quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently write National 
Examinations. 
 
 CREATE…………..originate, predict, and design

In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                 
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful by relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life; 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


xxx 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
1. Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The  next day, 
discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
2. Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
3. Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
4. Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
5. Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
6. Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the most points?) 
and 
 
7. Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY (POD) 


xxxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can: 
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do.  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed.  
 
delete extraneous information.  
 
identify the parts in the question.  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best.  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved.  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information.  
 
share student-generated questions.  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers.   
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
*NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

ASSESSMENT 
1. Read and write the 
numbers 0 to 100 on a 
number line. 
 Number Line  
A line that has equally spaced 
points named by numbers. 
Example:  
 
   
              0   1  2   3   4   5   6 
 Arrange number cards on a number line in 
ascending order i.e. 0,1, 2, 3, … 20 
 
 Have students identify numbers on the number 
line which matches their age, the number of 
cookies in their lunch box, the number of windows 
in the classroom, etc. 
 
 Use Velcro to attach numbers to the number line. 
Have some students close their eyes while you 
remove a number. Point out the secret number to 
the children whose eyes are opened. Have the 
children whose eyes were closed tell what number 
is missing. Do this for several numbers.

3. Arrange numbers in 
ascending and descending 
order. 
 Numbers are said to be in ascending order 
when they are arranged from the smallest to 
the largest number. 
For example: 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21 are 
arranged in ascending order. 
 
 Numbers are said to be in descending order 
when they are arranged from the largest to 
the smallest number. 
   For example 25, 21, 17, 13 and 9 are 
arranged in descending order. 
 Use number cards to tell where 
come numbers in relation to the 
position of other numbers.  i.e.     
- before: in front of (27, 28) 
- after: following in place (632, 633) 
- between: the number  
between two numbers  
   (541, 542, 543)

 Addition Facts: The addition of two single-digit 
addends producing sums to 18. 
For example: 7 + 9 = 16s 
 
Addend: a number to be added to another. 
 When zero is added to a second number, the answer 
is the second number. For example, 0 + 20= 20.  
 Adding one is just like counting by one.  
 Subtraction facts are facts you should know just by 
thinking, not counting. Once you know these facts, 
you can subtract any number easily. 
 Show the relationship between the addition and 
subtractions facts. 
 For example: 15 – 8 = 7. Ask students to think 
about what goes with 8 to make 15. The students 
use a known addition fact 
    8 + 7 = 15 to solve the subtraction fact. 
 Use flash cards and allow students 
to identify addition facts in less 
than 3 seconds. This indicates 
mastery of the fact. 
 
i. Place these cards in the “I 
know” stack. Review with 
students the facts that are easily 
retrieved. The cards that are left 
become the “I want to know” 
stack. As cards from this stack 
are learned they become the “I 
learned” stack.

14. Explain strategies used to 
arrive at sums and 
differences. 
Strategies 
  Adding 10 to a number: Adding 10 to a number 
does not require any counting. For example, 
10 + 2 =                  8 + 10 = 
10  + 5 =                 7 + 10 = 
10 + 9 =                  3 + 10 = 
 
 
Think Addition Strategy: This strategy 
demonstrates how students can use their 
knowledge of adding facts to find the answers to 
subtraction equations. For example 
 
Example: For 10-6, students should look at the 
number and think “6 plus what equals 10?’ and 
determine the missing addend. 
 
 The Count Back Strategy: If students have to 
subtract 1, 2, or even 3 from a number, they 
could employ a counting back strategy with or 
without visualizing jumping back on a number 
line. 
 Use file folder games where 
students match the sums to the 
equations. 
 
 Provide one group of students 
with addition and subtraction 
problems. Write them on 
greeting card size construction 
paper and hang them around the 
students’ neck. Give another 
group the answers to the addition 
and subtraction facts. Write them 
on greeting card size 
construction paper and hang 
them around their necks. After 
giving a signal have students 
‘find their partners’.

 
Teacher flashes 
subtraction and addition 
fact cards to students. All 
fact cards should be 
random addition and 
subtraction of 1, 2, and 3 
(adding 10 to a number, 
think addition, count 
back) 
 i. Students look at cards and 
verbally count back, add 
10, or think addition to 
determine the solution. 
 
 ii. Evaluate students’ answers 
to determine whether they 
used the correct strategy. 
 
 iii. Evaluate students’ 
answers to the sum and 
differences and keep track 
of right and wrong 
answers by sorting them 
as you flash.

15. Create and explain fact 
families using addition 
and subtraction skills to 
show the relationship 
between addition and 
subtraction. 
 Fact families: A fact family is a group of related 
facts using the same numbers. Example 
       4 + 3 = 7             7 – 3 = 4, 
      3 + 4 = 7             7 – 4 = 3.  
 Fact families are a very powerful tool for mastering 
facts; once you know one fact in a family, you can 
work out the other facts in the same family.  
 Fact families are also useful for solving problems 
with missing addends, such as 4 + __ = 7 
Make a Triangle: 
 On the points of the triangle write 
the digits in the fact family: 
For example:2,3, 5.  
 
 On the triangle, have the child 
write the 2 addition and 2 
subtraction facts for that family. 
You could duplicate many 
triangles, with lines for the facts. 
Then you can "customize" each 
triangle!

16.  Find the sums of 2 two-
digit numbers using a 
variety of methods 
(Continued). 
 
 Addition of two-digit numbers is developed 
sequentially, beginning by finding the sums of 
numbers that are multiples of 10.  
 
  For example: To add 40 plus 50, a child may think of 
the basic addition fact, 4 + 5 = 9, and then affix a 
zero to the five to get the sum, 90. When children do 
this, the important point to emphasize is that they are 
not really adding 4 and 5, but rather 4 tens and 5 
tens. 
Hundred Board Sums 
 Have students in cooperative 
groups cut numbers from the 
hundred board to create addition 
problems. Students then find the 
sums of the problems.

16.  Find the sums of 2 two-
digit numbers using a 
variety of methods. 
  
 Addition algorithm is based on the base-ten 
positional numeration system, and so when adding 
two-digit numbers, place value must be 
acknowledged. For example, 34 + 52.  
 
 The first digit from the left is in the tens place, and 
the second digit from the left is in the ones place. 
34 + 52 can be written in the following way: 
 
                          34        30   + 4 
                             +52    + 50   + 2 
         86        80   + 6 = 86 
 
 Adding 34 and 52 is equivalent to finding the sum 
of 3 tens (30) and 5 tens (50), and then adding to 
this result the sum of 4 ones and 2 ones. 
 Give students copies of the local 
newspaper. In pairs they will

21. Subtract two-digit 
numbers with renaming. 
 
When subtracting two-digit numbers, begin 
with the ones place. If the minuend is smaller 
than the subtrahend, first rename in the tens 
place. To rename means to change 1 ten into 
ten ones. Next, add the ten ones to the 
minuend in the ones place. This will rename 
the tens digit and the ones digit. Then, subtract 
(from ones column, first). 
 
 
Example: 82 – 29 =? 
 Come to the Shop! In cooperative 
learning groups, students purchase 
items from their “mini grocery 
stores”. Each group member takes 
turns being the cashier. The cashier 
must determine how much change 
each person will receive (using 
subtraction with renaming) and the 
group members must also calculate 
the “bills” to confirm that the cashier 
is correct.

 Remember that multiplication is repeated 
addition. 
Example: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15 
                5 groups of 3      = 15 
                   5 x 3 = 15 
 
 
This means that there are 5 groups of 3, 
which total 15 
 
Example: 1 bird has 2 legs 5 birds   
          
 
 In groups using manipulatives, 
students explore multiplication as 
repeated addition. 
 
Example: Solving Problems around 
the School Using Repeated Addition 
Take students on a tour around the 
school. Have them solve problems like 
counting the number of desks and chairs 
in a classroom, computers in the 
computer lab, number of juice in a box 
sold by the lunch vendor, etc. Explain to 
them that if the desks and chairs are set 
up in rows and columns it is easier to 
multiply to find the total number, instead 
of counting each item separately.

 Division is sharing or splitting into equal parts. It 
is the process of calculating the number of times 
one number is contained in another one. It can be

 When using repeated subtraction begin with the 
largest number and take away the smaller number 
until you arrive to zero.

 Use the number line to assist students with 
estimation. 
 
 Given a number, find the two numbers that come 
before and after (counting in tens) that number. 
Example: The number is 34. Between which two 
numbers (counting in tens) does this number fall? 
Answer: 30 and 40. 34 is closest to which number, 
30 or 40? It is closer to 30. Then, 34 is estimated to 
30.  
 
 Add the numbers. 
Example:  
    4 5                 5 0 
 + 7 2              +7 0 
                       1 2 0 
a. 45 is between the numbers 40 and 50. 45 is closer to 
50. Therefore, 45 is estimated to 50. 
a. 72 is between the numbers 70 and 80. 72 is closer 
to 70. Therefore, 72 is estimated to 70. 
 
 The estimated sum is 120 
For subtraction, the rule remains the same. After 
estimation, you subtract instead of add. 
 
Use flash card and allow student 
to estimate sums and differences

1. Estimate and measure 
objects to the nearest 
metre, centimetre, or 
decimeter, feet, inches, 
yards and miles. 
 To estimate measurement, give a guess that 
comes as close as possible to the actual 
measurement of an object. To check the accuracy 
of the guess, we use a ruler to get the exact 
measurement. 
 
 Metre (m)- basic unit of measuring length in the 
metric system. 
 
 Centimetre (c) – a smaller unit of measuring 
length in the metric system. It takes 100 
centimetres to make 1 metre 
 
 Decimetre - 1/10 of a metre or 10 decimetre = 1 
metre. 
 
 
Customary Units of Length 
12 inches = 1 foot 
 3 feet = 1 yard 
1760 yards = 1 mile 
 Give each child/group an object 
and allow them to make 
reasonable estimates as to the 
length of each object based on the 
unit being used. Have them 
measure it, and write the length as 
closely as possible to its actual 
measurement e.g. which string is 
about 3cm?   
(check estimates by measuring)

3. Estimate, measure and 
then compare the mass or 
weight of objects using 
standard units. 
 Mass is how much space an object takes 
up. Weight tells how heavy or light 
something is. 
 
 In the metric system, grams (g) and 
kilograms (kg) are used to measure 
mass. 1000 grams equals 1 kilogram. 
 
 In the customary system, ounces (oz.) 
and pounds (lbs.) are used to measure 
weight. 16 oz. equals 1 pound. 
 
 
 Heavier means having more weight than 
another object. On a balance scale, the 
heavier object will lower the pan. 
 
 Light means having less weight than 
another object. On a balance scale, the 
lighter object will be on the higher pan. 
 
 To be balanced means to have the same 
weight as another. On a balance scale, 
both pans will be at the same level.  
 
 On a standard scale, you read the weight 
of an object by looking at the number 
where the marker stops. 
 Place an object on either side of a balance in the 
pans, then observe to see which is heavier (lower 
pan) or lighter (higher pan)  
 
 
 
 
  E.g. 
 
Draw objects on a sheet of paper under the 
headings. 
 
‘Heavier or lighter’    Example: 
Heavier                      Lighter 
                    
   
(ball)               
 
 Have students estimate the mass/weight of 
items, place them on the scale one at a time and 
read the scale. They will then compare the 
mass/weight of items                                     
(feather). 
 
 Play a game called “We balance” where 
students try to choose objects that are the same 
weight and place them on a scale to see if they 
balance or not.

 Place frozen or cold potatoes in 
bags (1 per bag) also place 
hot/warm potatoes in other bags. 
First child chooses a bag and tries 
to guess; by touch, whether the 
potato is hot or cold. After 
guessing, other members of the 
group decide if the potato is hot or 
cold. If the guess is correct, the 
first child gets a counter, and the 
bag is returned to the group and 
mixed with the other bags.

13. Count, compare, and 
make change using a 
collection of coins 
(Bahamian and US) of 
amounts to $10.00 or 
less. 
 Count groups of coins which are 
either of the same value or mixed 
values to a total of $10.00, or less For 
example, all pennies or pennies and 
dimes  
 
 Decide whether one group of coins is 
worth more or less than another. e.g. 
 
                                                     
   less        less       less                   more 
 
 Use appropriate strategies to deduce 
how much money is left when some 
has been spent and create change. 
 E.g.  
                                     
 
 
 
       25¢ - 14¢ = 11¢ 
 
 
 
  
 
 Play a ‘shopping’ game using tagged 
items to sell. Give customers (students) 
a specific amount of money. E.g. 50¢. 
Cashier (student) must give the 
customer the correct change once he or 
she has made a ‘purchase’. 
 
Example:           
costs 26¢ 
 
     Change = 24¢.

4. Differentiate between plane 
and solid shapes using 
words, pictures, or objects. 
 Flat surface on solid shapes are plane 
shapes. 
 Construct plane and / or solid 
shapes using a variety of 
materials - E.g. play dough, 
toothpicks, blocks, pipe-
cleaners, etc., and then compare 
them.

 Materials for constructing plane 
shapes and solid figures 
 
Pair plane shapes with solid 
shapes which have like flat 
surfaces. 
     Example 
                             
 
 
 
 
Create a model of their 
community using plane and 
solid shapes (it is 
recommended to use recycled 
materials.) 
5. Identify and apply slide, 
flip, and turn to plane 
figures (Continued). 
 Plane figures can slide, flip, and turn.  
 
a. Slide is a movement of a figure to a new 
position without turning or flipping. A shape 
can slide right, left, up, down or diagonally 
and won’t change. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Geometric Slide: Students will 
do a geometric slide dance. They 
will start with one hand out to the 
left to imitate a shape. They will 
then use their bodies to show 
slide, flip, and turn.

b. Flip is a movement that involves going over an 
imaginary line. A shape can flip from left to right 
as well as from up to down. When it flips, it faces 
the opposite direction. 
 
 
 
 
 
c. Turn is a movement that involves rotating in a 
circular motion around a point. When a shape turns 
it changes direction.

6. Identify and draw lines of 
symmetry.  
 A line of symmetry is an imaginary line that 
divides a shape into 2 equal parts that are the same 
shape and size. 
 
Lines of symmetry can be drawn from left to 
right or top to bottom on a shape. 
Example  
  
                            
                          line of symmetry  
 
If you fold the picture of a figure along the line of 
symmetry, both sides of the line should be the 
same. 
 
 
Some shapes have one line of symmetry. Some 
shapes have more than one.  
Examples:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fold pre-cut plane shapes or 
objects to create 2 equal 
congruent parts, then trace or 
draw the line of symmetry. 
 
 
 
 
 
Trace common objects and state 
whether the objects have one, 
more than one or no lines of 
symmetry.

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

Some of the things that 
scientists look for 
when deciding which 
group to put an animal 
in, are the animals’ 
body parts, what 
materials cover the 
animals’ body, and 
how the animal moves. 
 
Some animal body 
coverings and parts 
include birds with 
feathers and wings, 
fish with scales, fins 
and a tail, dogs with 
hair and legs, bears

weather affects 
people 
● People who predict what 
the weather will be like in 
the future are called 
Weather Forecasters. 
● Weather can change over a 
period of time. The kinds 
of weather can affect what 
we do, the kinds of 
activities we take part in 
and the clothes we wear. 
We use sunglasses, hats 
and umbrellas to protect us 
from the sun, raincoats and 
umbrellas to protect us 
from rain. People have 
made all of these things to 
solve problems related to 
the weather. 
● Some workers who depend 
on weather forecasters are 
pilots, sea captains, truck 
drivers and farmers. 
1a. Dress Up for the 
Weather Role Play 
Before the Activity: Collect 
various clothes so you can 
create a Weather Dress-Up 
area in your classroom. Have 
children work in small 
groups. Explain to children 
that each group will have a 
turn dressing up for different 
kinds of weather. Once 
children are dressed up, have 
them describe the type of 
weather. Have them pretend 
to play in the weather. 
Continue with each group.

explain changes in 
the moon 
● The moon orbits or 
moves around the 
Earth. As it does this, 
its shape appears to 
change because the sun 
shines on and off one 
side of the moon.. This 
is why the moon 
appears to have 
different shapes at 
different times of the 
month. These shapes 
are called the phases of 
the moon. 
● Some phases of the 
moon are: 
new moon - the moon 
is between the Earth 
and sun. We cannot see 
the Moon at all. 
first-quarter moon - 
after a week, the moon 
orbits one quarter of the

things and to make 
them move. 
● A source is a place 
where something 
comes from. Three 
sources of energy are 
the sun, wind and

● The sun is the most 
important source of 
energy for the earth. 
Energy from the sun 
is called solar 
energy. It comes in 
the form of light and 
heat. 
● Observing 
● Recording

There are many uses of 
energy. For example, 
energy is used by cars, 
toys, to make fires, fly 
kites, watch television 
etc.

 
Heat energy can be 
used for a number 
of things including 
cooking, ironing, 
baking and 
changing water into 
steam. 
 
People use air in many 
ways. Moving air is 
wind. Wind energy can 
be changed into 
electricity. A windmill 
or wind turbine does 
this. People use air to 
make things fly (e.g. a 
kite, airplane and hot air 
balloon). 
1c. Make a simple Pinwheel 
Step #1: 
Take your piece of paper and 
cut it into a perfect square. An 
easy way to do this is fold 
the paper into a triangle, 
taking one corner and lining 
it up to the other side. This 
will leave excess on one side 
that, once cut, gives you a 
square. 
Step #2: 
Fold the paper diagonally so it 
turns into a triangle and crease 
it lightly. Repeat this for the 
opposite direction as 
well. You will then unfold 
and have a creased "X" on 
the 
page.

halfway to the middle of the 
paper. Be sure not to cut all 
the way. 
Step #4: 
Bend each corner into the 
middle. Make sure to bend 
and not fold. Once all 4 
corners are in the middle push 
the push pin through them all 
as well as the straw or eraser.

We waste natural resources 
in many ways in our homes 
by using more than we need

Wasting natural resources 
is not good for the 
environment. 
Resources such as ground 
water can be depleted. 
Because The Bahamas has 
no rivers, most of its water 
for our homes come from 
the ground. Salt water can 
be changed into fresh 
usable water, but it is very 
expensive. In the Bahamas 
the usable fresh water sits 
on top of the saltwater in 
the ground. If we waste 
water, we will use up all of 
fresh water supply. 
They should provide tips on things 
that they should not do. 
"Closed Classroom" Experiment. 
Tell students that for the next week, 
the trash in their classroom will not

they are going to have to be careful 
about what they throw away. 
Explain that at the end of the week, 
they'll check to see how much trash 
they have and if anything didn't 
need to be thrown away. 
Conduct a Litter Experiment. 
Before students enter the classroom, 
scatter various litter items around 
the room. Do not mention the litter. 
Watch students' reactions and 
behaviours. Eventually, ask students 
how they feel about having their 
environment littered. Discuss the 
problems litter can cause.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method 
❖ 
Cooperative Learning Technique

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
 Provide guidance for the students. 


 
  
 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

SCIENCE PROCESS

BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps:

HYPOTHESIS 
PREDICTIONS 
TEST OF PREDICTIONS

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere. 


332 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and 
teachers. As the internet is constantly changing, some websites may become non-functional, outdated or unsuitable.

Journals and Logs: Science, Conversation, and Writing 
This article from Perspectives in Education and Deafness describes different types of logs and journals and includes ideas for how they can be used in the science classroom. 


 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

I. “OWL STRATEGY” 
Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic.

VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.

SOCIAL STUDIES
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit


 
10 | P a g e  
 
SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief systems, such 
as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and beliefs? What does 
language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, sociology and anthropology, 
as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one to 
develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? How has 
the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme typically appears in 
courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things located? 
Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have for people? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to adulthood? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are maintained or 
changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by institutions? How do 
institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with sociology, 
anthropology, psychology, political science and history.  
 
 
 


 
11 | P a g e  
 
 
Power, Authority  
Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is power? What 
form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, structured, maintained 
and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing 
with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of the 
factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic concepts 
and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is new 
technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which is 
unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people benefit 
from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural and physical 
sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, civics and 
government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme typically 
appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. Students 
confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the balance 
between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world community? How can I 
make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, cultural anthropology and 
fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

as shallow waters and the darker 
areas as deep water. The Tongue

The Bahamas. 
 
Maps are used to give directions. 
Aviators can use a map to locate 
airports and identify the 
settlements on the island.  Special 
symbols are placed on the map to 
help us find this information.  A 
four-point compass is a tool used 
to show directions.   If you are on 
one island, the four-point compass 
can tell you which islands are 
north, south, east and west of that 
island.

In The Bahamas, the most 
dangerous weather condition that 
threatens our country each year is 
a hurricane or hurricanes 
depending on whether or not the 
season is very active. 
 
A hurricane is a dangerous storm 
with strong winds and heavy rain 
that can last for hours or even 
days.   
 
These winds often destroy homes 
and the rain causes flooding in the 
community.  It is important to

Things that are used in the 
environment are called resources.  
Some resources come from nature.  
These are called natural resources.  
 
In The Bahamas, we use the natural 
resources of sun, sand and sea to 
attract visitors from all over the 
world.  We use straw from the 
native palm trees to create beautiful 
baskets, hats, bags and mats for the 
tourists to purchase and take home 
as souvenirs. A souvenir is a thing 
that is kept as a reminder of a 
person, place or event. 
 
Many Bahamian use fish and conch 
from the sea for food.   
 
Nature has provided us with these 
resources and we use them to make 
money and survive.   We must 
preserve our environment and 
natural resources.  Preservation is to 
keep in a good condition, preserve.

4. Discuss ways in which we can 
conserve or preserve our 
natural resources. 
 
 
We should try to use these 
resources wisely.  If we do not 
preserve them, then we will lose 
them.  
 
Litter is an easy way to destroy our 
natural resources.  Cans, bottles 
and plastic of any form can find 
their way in our waters and kill our 
reef. This causes the fish to move 
away.  
 
Visitors to our country love the 
clean beaches and beautiful plant 
and animal life.  Litter takes away 
from that beauty.  It also creates a 
health risk in our communities as 
the rat, roaches, flies and mosquito 
population will increase.

the rules that they should follow. 
All leaders depend on helpers to 
get the job done.  At school, the 
leader is the principal. The 
principal has many helpers. These 
are the teachers, nurse, counselors, 
janitors and security guards.  
 
These helpers each have a job to

4. Discuss how these nation 
builders keep us safe. 
 
5. Define national heroes 
 
Nation builders are community 
helpers.   Police officers, defence 
force officers and firemen all keep 
our country safe. 
 
The Royal Bahamas Police 
Officers see that we follow the rule 
of our country on land.   
While the Royal Bahamas Defence 
Force Officers keep the laws of the 
sea.   
 
All countries have heroes.  These 
are people who fought to change 
rules that seem unfair to some. 
After they die, members of the 
community remember them for the 
brave job they did to create and 
change rules.

5. Sequence the day in the life 
of a fisherman.  
First, fishermen load their boats 
with wire traps or nets used to 
catch fish.  Then they sail out to 
their favourite spot and drop the 
nets or traps. 
 
Later, they return to the spot and 
pull the net and traps back on the 
boat.  The traps are filled with 
fish.  Then, the fisherman returns 
to the main land to sell his catch. 
Farmers and Fishermen who sell 
products for money are called 
vendors.

2. Discuss the importance of 
showing appreciation for 
cultural songs and stories. 
 
 
Culture is what makes us different 
from other people in the world.  It 
makes us Bahamians.  Bahamian 
culture can only be seen through 
the life of another Bahamian. 
 
Ring plays are little rhymes we use 
to sing and dance to. 
 
Folktales are stories passed down 
from mother to child over the 
years.  It usually teaches a lesson, 
or tells a tale. 
 
It is important to pass on songs 
and stories of our culture.  This 
helps to preserve our culture and 
to give us an identity.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas. Mary Ingraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 


 
xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirations and feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

During the 70s the game declined, 
Because teachers did not know the game. 
They taught track and field and other sports, 
Which buried the cricket name.

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies should be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.   
 
 
The following example indicates how the curriculum objectives are number: 
Example: 1.1.A.1.1

1.1. B.2.1. Explain why 
Christians refer to God 
as Father 
 
In the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus 
taught us to address God as 
“Our Father” (Matt. 6:9).  
The Bible tells us that 
through faith individuals can 
become children of God and 
can refer to Him as “Abba” 
or Father (Rom. 8:15).  God 
is called Father because He 
cares and provides for His 
children.

As Christians, we should 
be grateful that Jesus 
Christ came to earth to die

express thanks in worship, 
prayer and singing. We 
can give Him thanks by 
obeying His commands. 
Psalm

states, 
“They must thank the Lord 
for His constant love, for

speaks to individuals when 
they pray.  We must be still 
and silent before God so that 
He can speak to our hearts 
and minds. Sometimes God 
may speak in an audible 
voice like He did with the boy 
Samuel (1 Sam. Chap. 3).

The Bible teaches us what is 
right and what is wrong. In the 
Old Testament, God gave the 
Israelites or the Jews, rules or 
laws 
called 
the 
Ten 
Commandments.  These laws 
are found in Exodus Chapter 
20.  It is right to worship God, 
honour 
our 
parents 
and 
respect others.  It is wrong to 
worship idols or false gods, tell 
lies, kill someone and steal.  
 
Other scriptures also teach us 
to do what is right such as:  
Eph. 6:1-2; 1 John 4:7-8; Eph. 
4:32 
Concepts: laws, 
commandments

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip 
them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They are 
respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as that state of well-
being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human development. 
This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration with Government 
Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will include sensitization and training 
for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit will 
coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, substance abuse 
prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be conducted to 
address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles through 
training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in learning, 
the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the development of individuals 
and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many important social, cultural and health issues 
in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown that confident, well-informed and well-supported 
young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the lifelong 
acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In order for 
individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address issues and 
risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 
HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse and drug dealing, negative 
sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, Sexuality 
and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is interrelated and has been 
developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary methods. 
Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of accurate knowledge, skills development and exploration of values and attitudes. Health and Family Life classes 
afford students opportunities to build competencies for healthy self-development to deal with the challenges of life as well as make positive contributions 
to national, regional and international development. 
 
Finally, the activities and ideas presented in this document are not exhaustive.  You may be able to find many more to match the lesson topics and the 
specific objectives.  Please feel free to do this and share your ideas with other teachers for the enrichment of the programme and the development of our 
children.

Knowing how to get along with people is important in preventing 
conflicts and promoting peace at home, school and in communities. 
 
A conflict between two or more people often occurs in relationships e.g. 
sibling rivalry, parents and children, friends, classmates, husband and 
wife, gang members.   
 
Reasons for conflicts in relationships:  
Poor communication; changes in the family structure; jealously;

they don’t want to be touched They should tell an adult (police, teacher, 
nurse, guidance counselor or parent) if someone touches them 
inappropriately. (Review Grade 1, Standard 2.2: Appropriate and 
Inappropriate Touches.) 
 
If children feel uncomfortable when someone touches them they should 
say ‘no”, get away from the situation, “go” and “tell” a trusted adult 
what happened.  
 
If someone touches them and tells them to keep it a secret, they should 
always tell an adult anyway. 
 
Children should not talk to or give out information to strangers, 
especially when they are home alone. They should not take short cuts 
especially in wooded areas.

The environment is made up of living and non-living things. 
  
Living things in the environment include: plants, animals and people. 
 
Non-living things in the environment are water, air, land, sunlight, 
man-made products (roads, buildings, places where people live, work, 
shop, exercise and play). 
 
Benefits of the Living Environment  
- Magnificent species the earth has to offer 
- Animals provide food, clothes, shelter, companionship and 
transportation  
- Wood from trees is used to make many different things  
- Plants take carbon dioxide out of the air and produce oxygen. This 
enables us to have oxygen to breathe and reduces the effect of carbon 
dioxide which has been blamed for global warming as it traps the heat 
from the sun in that atmosphere. 
- Forest, trees and other natural ecosystems reduce the risk of 
catastrophic climate change impacts like floods and droughts

TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices, and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, values and 
attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. However, 
teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit grades which will 
contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. (sharing 
thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills)

APPENDIX III 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will be time 
for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, role play, 
games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication, 
negotiation, assertiveness and cooperation. 
 
12. Ensure that grades are recorded in the mark book for the topics taught (date, topic, and number grade) 
 
13. Establish interactive learning centres in the classroom which should include current teaching aids and samples of students’ activities.  
 
14. Create instructional and motivational bulletin boards/charts that reflect the concepts and skills being taught e.g. family patterns, body parts, hygiene, 
drug abuse prevention, conflict resolution, HIV, AIDS STIs,  nutrition, environment issues, self-esteem, teamwork, etc.

TEACHING GOOD VALUES AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP 
 
 
Dr. Marian Bock, Director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle’s Virtues Project, defines virtues as universal positive character traits. She defines 
values as agreements, rules, principles, codes and beliefs about how to practice these virtues. Bock recommends integrating fifty-two universal virtues 
into appropriate family life classes by encouraging students to recognize them in themselves and others.

HFLE was designed to 
address the needs of students 
and to empower them with 
skills and attitudes required 
for personal development 
and for active participation in 
society. 
 
The rationale to implement 
HFLE curriculum in schools 
was based on the high rate of 
teenage pregnancy along 
with other related social 
problems in the society.  
 
The curriculum was 
Designed to address issues 
and as well as promote 
values and appropriate 
behaviours. 
 
The rationale for

in addressing sexual issues 
and to address the limited 
learning about health 
issues such as sexuality, 
eating and fitness and 
interpersonal relationships. 
 
The curriculum was 
designed to prepare 
children and young people 
for the challenges of 
adolescence and adulthood. 
 
It also provided awareness 
among children and young 
people about the 
relationship between their 
health and the choices they 
make in everyday life. 
 
The Personal and Social 
Curriculum focused on 
developing the personality 
in its entire dimension: 
physically, intellectual and 
emotional. 
 
The curriculum was designed 
to address the following: 
 
Students’ knowledge, 
understanding and skills. 
 
Risks factors and re-
emerging diseases and the 
emergence of relatively new 
diseases.

PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
 
The new direction of Physical Education at Primary level is to provide all students with a safe, enjoyable and nurturing environment where physical activity and the 
development of motor skills will be enhanced.  Each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her potential through the acquisition of knowledge, and skills 
that will transfer to a healthy lifestyle and lifelong sports.  The base of the Physical Programme is Body Management Competence, which gives focus to the development of 
fundamental skills that lead into specialized skills training.  Primary students will also participate in the core sports such as Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, Soccer 
and Track and Field.   Interschool competitions take place in all of the “core sports” aforementioned including, Mini- tennis.  It is the responsibility of the New Providence 
Primary School Sports Association in collaboration with the Department of Education and the various Sports Factions to organize and conduct the competitions, 
reinforcing the principles of fair play, sportsmanship and self-control.

CONTENT STANDARDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
1. Demonstrates competency and proficiency in movement forms. 
The intent of this standard is to develop competence and proficiency in movement.  In preparation for adulthood, students should have acquired the basic skills to 
participate in a wide variety of leisure and work- related physical activities and advance in at least two or three areas. 
 
2. Apply movement concept and principles to learning and development of motor skills. 
This standard concerns the ability of the learner to use cognitive information to understand and enhance motor skills.  By graduation the student should have developed 
sufficient knowledge and ability to independently use their learned behavior to acquire new skills while continuing to refine existing ones. 
 
3. Exhibits physically active lifestyles. 
The intent of this standard is to establish patterns of regular participation in meaningful physical activity.  This standard should connect what was done in physical 
education classes with the lives of students outside of class. 
4. Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 
This standard is for the student to achieve a health-enhancing level of physical fitness.  Student should be encouraged to develop higher levels of basic fitness and 
physical competence as needed for many work situations and active leisure participation.  Students should have both the ability and the willingness to accept 
responsibility for personal fitness leading to an active, healthy lifestyle. 
 
5. Demonstrates responsible personal and social behaviors in physical activity settings. 
Achievement of this standard includes safe practices, adherence to rules and procedure, etiquette, cooperation and teamwork, and positive social interaction. 
 
6. Show respect for differences among people in physical activity settings. 
The intent of this standard is to develop respect for individual similarities and differences through positive interaction among participants in physical activity.  
Similarities and differences include characteristics of culture, ethnicity, motor performance, disabilities, physical characteristics (strength, size, and shape), gender, race 
and socioeconomic status.  
 
7. Recognize that physical activity opportunities are for enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. 
As a result of these intrinsic benefits of participation, students will begin to actively pursue lifelong physical activities that meet their own needs.

2. Keep the ball close. The ball should be on the 
ground directly below the head as it is contacted: 
eyes look forward. Keep the ball within two to 
four feet while dribbling. 
3. Move with the ball. The soccer dribble is a 
movement activity and should be performed at a 
speed faster than a walk.

By the end of  Grades  1  - 2  
the students will be able to: 
 
- 
Demonstrate the 
different starting 
positions. 
 
- 
Display proper 
running Techniques. 
 
- 
Demonstrate the 
difference between 
running, sprinting, 
walking, striding and 
jogging. 
 
SPRINTS 
- 
Sprinting ranges from the 50 meters the 
400 meters.  Sprinting consists of two 
basic principles: stride length and stride 
speed.  There are three parts of effective 
sprinting: the start, efficient running form, 
and the finish.  Each of these basic parts of 
the total sprint effort has essential 
demands.  Sprinting form is a very 
individual matter because of differences in 
body builds. However, fundamental 
running movements can be portrayed in 
general terms of correct foot placement, 
arm action, shoulder and head angles, body 
alignment, and leg and knee action. 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Emphasize the toes pointing straight 
ahead, as opposed to in or out, for efficient 
running. 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms are used for balance 
- 
Thumbs should be relaxed 
- 
The arm moves driving the elbow forward 
and back, never passing higher than the 
armpit on the forward swing and never 
further than six inches beyond the hips. 
- 
Arms never cross the midline of the body.

- 
The shoulder should be relaxed with little 
or no rotation. 
 
HEAD 
- 
The head should be straight ahead with 
eyes focused on the finish line. 
- 
The face (jaws and facial muscles) should 
be relaxed. 
 
BODY ALIGNMENT 
- 
The student should rise up on his or her 
toes and lean forward to where a position 
of balance is barely maintained, that is the 
correct body angle.  Forward angle is best 
when accelerating. 
 
LEG ACTION AND KNEE LIFT 
- 
Knees should come up close to parallel and 
straight ahead. Do not permit knees to 
rotate in or out. 
- 
The sprinter should run on the balls of the 
foot, using a pushing action to get drive 
against the surface of the track. 
- 
Maintain stride length regardless of 
fatigue; run relaxed. 
 
THE FINISH 
- 
When finishing, run through the finish 
line with a straight body; lean in the last 
stride. 
- 
Leap, land on balls of the feet.  
 
 
Strengthen opposite muscles to prevent 
injury.

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them with the 
necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an independent, ever-changing world. 
Visual Arts Unit 
Vision 
We envision an art education programme in which all students in The Bahamas are guided toward literacy, an appreciation of Artists, craft persons, and Bahamian 
culture. We also envision an art education programme that is comprehensive and will nurture the spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, creative, imaginative, aesthetic, 
social and physical wellbeing of the child. 
Mission Statement 
Our mission is to advance art education through appropriate curriculum, teacher development programmes, stimulating environments, the provision of materials and 
relevant information. By doing so, we provide students with learning experiences that focus on their creative development, aesthetic appreciation, critical thinking and 
cultural awareness as well as inter-disciplinary integration. 
Belief Statement 
Art education is beneficial to all students regardless of social, ethnic, economic or educational background. Art is an integral part of the overall educational development 
of the student as it compliments and unites other disciplines while promoting visual literacy skills, imaginative thinking and visual communication. 
We further believe that: 
• Art education provides students with the means to think critically, experience, and understand the world around them in unique ways. 
• Art enables students to become self-directed and lifelong learners. 
• Art provides learning opportunities of varying abilities. 
• Art education enhances the ability to interact in society by developing creative problem solving, inquiry, and communication skills, and by providing an avenue 
for self-expression and multiple points of view. 
• Students develop attitudes of appreciation, self-worth, joy in the creation of artworks, and in viewing the works of other students and artists.

• Art is a way to appreciate the beauty and value of the environment and the preservation of our heritage. 
• Art provides opportunities to exhibit in classrooms, schools, art centres and museums, sharing the art curriculum with the community, teachers, students, and 
examiners. 
• Art education increases awareness of career possibilities, promotes entrepreneurial skills and highlights our community’s visual resources. 
• Art education reflects and influences the cultural, social, political and economic aspirations and concerns of our society. 
• Art is a way to appreciate differences and promotes cultural, social and ethnic similarities.

between the 
lightness and 
darkness of colours 
in art and nature. 
• Compare and 
contrast the range of 
hues  
• Produce work with a 
variety of tints and 
shades. 
Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a colour 
can be.  Add white to a colour to make it 
light and add black to a colour to make 
it dark. When black is added to a colour 
it creates a SHADE. When white is 
added to a colour you create a TINT. 
White is the lightest value; black is the 
darkest. Value is important to drawing 
and painting, value changes are what 
creates contrast. Contrast helps us 
understand 2-D artworks.  
• Mix the secondary colours then darken each by 
adding black 
• Make 3 values of each primary colour, light, 
medium and dark 
• Paper collage different colour values together in 
fun shapes and designs

• Use stamp pads to create value scales 
• Students examine similarities and differences in 
colour eg. Light blue, dark blue 
• Paint pictures using exclusively light or dark 
colours 
• Nature walk for leaves with different values of 
green 
Informal: 
Tell how you show value in 
your artwork. Which part 
has more white in the

shells and lots more. 
These are created by repeating lines, 
shapes and colours. The part 
that is repeated is called a 
motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.

Texture  
Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough. 
Tactile Texture can be touched and 
seen. Visual Texture is a texture that 
can be seen in a picture rather than felt.

Cave Art 
Cave paintings are paintings on cave 
walls and ceilings. These paintings 
were made in prehistoric times. Most 
cave paintings date from 10,000 to 
20,000 years ago. The oldest is from 
about 32,000 years ago,  
It is not known why these paintings 
were made. Most people think they may 
have had a function for rituals. They 
may also have been a way to 
communicate; to tell other people about 
something. It could also be a form of 
hunting magic, which is meant to 
increase the number of animals. Most 
paintings are in caves that are difficult 
to access.  
 
Today, there are about 350 caves 
known which have paintings in them. 
Many are in France and Spain.  
 
Most often, animals or hunting scenes 
were painted. Sometimes hands are 
there too, there are also more abstract 
patterns.

apple or a car. 
Negative 
This is the space that is left empty. It is 
the space around and between objects.

Henri Matisse 
Henri Matisse, born in 1869, began his 
working life doing administrative tasks 
for a court. As a gift, his mother gave 
him his first art supplies and he fell in 
love with painting. 
He studied art in Paris where he 
painted mostly landscapes and still 
lifes. He was successful at this and the 
state even bought five of his paintings. 
In 1898, he discovered impressionism. 
A friend and fellow painter, John Peter 
Russell introduced him to the work of 
the impressionists including van Gogh 
who was still unknown and Gauguin. 
Matisse’s style changed completely

• Identify the focal 
point in the 
artwork; 
• Compare and 
contrast the works 
of art and describe 
them, using the 
appropriate 
vocabulary. 
 
following this discovery and colour took 
centre stage in his paintings. 
This love of colour evolved into 
Fauvism, in which natural scenes are 
portrayed in unnatural, usually 
extremely bright, colours. 
By the end of his life Matisse was 
thoroughly interested in patterns and 
from this interest came his collages. 
Made from boldly hand-painted paper 
cut into shapes, Matisse’s collages were 
usually large works of simplicity.  
Andy Warhol 
He was a painter and sculptor. 
Warhol was born on August 6th 1928in 
Pennsylvania U.S.A. 
His dad was a construction worker. 
Warhol was sick at age 8 with the liver 
disease during this time his mother 
taught him to draw. 
When he was 14 his dad died from liver 
disease. 
His dad considered him the smartest of 
all the children so he saved money for 
Warhol to attend college. 
After graduating college in 1959 he 
moved to New York to become an artist. 
In 1961 he created the style of Pop Art. 
He is famous for his Campbell’s Soup 
Cans. In one of his paintings, he had 
200 soup cans that he repeated over
