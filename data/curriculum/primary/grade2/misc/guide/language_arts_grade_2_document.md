PREFACE 
 
 
To assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum, several strategies were employed.  The process 
began with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions.  These countries included 
Jamaica, the United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois) Canada and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 
guides).  The documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their 
rationale and philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as 
well as the Scope of Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa 
and several other countries were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of 
English and the Ministry of Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.    
 
Opportunities were also provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers 
throughout The Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen 
teachers throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students in order to get 
their feedback on what they wanted to learn about and the types of learning activities that they enjoyed.  Additionally, a 
focus group was conducted with members from the community that included business owners, parents and those who 
interact with students in after school clubs and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary teachers, one preschool teacher and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment 
Section.  Opportunities were also provided for several of the Family Island teachers to submit content and activities 
through the Education Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time 
engaged in research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction in order to meet the needs 
of their students.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
The revision of the 2022-2027 Curriculum Guidelines would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication 
of a number of committed teachers, officers, administrators, and community stakeholders.  The Language Arts Unit is 
especially grateful to the Curriculum Team members who worked long hours to ensure that this document was completed.  
Special acknowledgement is given to the late Verona Seymour, who served as an Assistant Director of Education for the

BELIEF STATEMENTS   
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student centered; 
2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make decisions as well as to develop self- 
confidence and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme 
and should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing 
sixth grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our 
students receive at the primary level, lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that 
students are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on the communication skills.  During this particular period in our history, knowledge of the basic 
communication skills is essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and 
more people are being pushed to use on-line services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct 
banking transactions, to pay bills, to make travel arrangements, to access government services and so much more.   
Additionally, changes in technology demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Land lines, 
that only required listening and speaking skills for its use, have been replaced with smart phones and computers where 
we can communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the 
internet, buy tickets, post to Facebook, create blogs, Snapchat, conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the 
world and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be that confidence in our education system that students 
will be prepared to communicate effectively in spite of the changes that occur.  Recognizing that the Language Arts skills 
are the foundation of all learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on 
producing students who are not only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability 
to communicate effectively in a rapidly advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves 
creatively, to collaborate and to problem solve as we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which 
speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education for all...”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of 
Oracy, Reading and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that 
they will need to become life-long learners and to navigate successfully in an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM  
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, 
teachers should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area 
subjects and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual fieldtrips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centers, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level in order to provide teachers and parents with a guide 
for what students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This 
information should be used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also provides an 
indication of the level of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become 
proficient in a particular area, teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted in 
order to make them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the 
end of the course of study.  Teachers should be guided by the content which indicates what students should know 
or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading 
(Phonemic Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar and 
Composition Writing). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds 
on the previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided 
into three categories:  basic, intermediate and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can 


Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 2 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                             21 
 
access content and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to do so, in order to 
meet the needs of their students.   
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of 
opportunities should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with 
various audiences.  They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large 
group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative 
projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary 
safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with 
students.  Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  In order to avoid 
duplication in the curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best 
applied.  It is expected that once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the 
strands and that they can be assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught the Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This 
particularly refers to reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be 
highlighted.  Students are to be exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are 
taught through teacher read-alouds and independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade 
level. 
                     
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading and after reading. 
 
 


Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 2 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                             22 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening   
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in the area of reading still 
have opportunities to understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (through the use of pictures, video 
clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions    
as students connect skills to their everyday experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle  
the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing to see if students have mastered the skill is to have them  
incorporate it in a writing exercise.  This will give them an opportunity to apply what they have learnt.  Students who 
are able to apply reading skills, would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  Following this      
method of teaching the comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into  
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as 
ends in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and 
Handwriting; however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in 
the case of Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should 
only be scored for what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week the number of 
items on the checklist should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the 
checklist should be continually reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been 
generated.  Students should be aware of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to 
assess their own writing before it is even submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, 
mechanics and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three 
lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of 
grade two cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will 
be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, 
and words from the grade level word list included in the appendices of this document.

Sub-Goal 1:  Engage effectively in listening and speaking situations for different purposes and audiences, and 
communicate using a variety of media. 
 
Objective 1.1  Display the characteristics of a good listener. 
Content

It is important to listen attentively 
when someone is speaking.  
When we do not, we sometimes 
miss important information. 
A good listener: 
 sits upright in the chair with 
feet firmly on the floor; 
 looks at the person who is 
speaking; 
 does not raise his/her hand 
when someone is speaking. 
 has hands that are free of 
pencils, papers, toys or similar 
items that can distract; 
 does not speak while 
someone else is speaking; 
 focuses on what the speaker 
is saying; and 
 responds appropriately to 
questions. 
Basic:  Have students compare 
and contrast two volunteers who 
are demonstrating good and 
weak listening behaviours. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
work in pairs and practice 
attentive listening by taking turns 
making eye contact and 
demonstrating appropriate body 
language while they share about 
activities that they like to do. 
 
Advanced:  Have students, in 
small groups, design a “Wanted” 
poster that seeks to find a good 
listener.  Encourage them to 
include all the listening 
characteristics. Have them 
present their posters. 
Utilize a listening 
checklist.  Provide 
students with feedback on 
their performance.  
 copy paper and 
crayons

Personal Information – name, names of 
parents, name of school, street address, 
telephone number, age, gender and 
birthday. 
 
Needs - There are many needs that people 
have.  People need food to eat, clothes to 
wear, a place to live, to feel safe and 
love.  These needs are best met within the 
family circle. However, there are times when 
family members may not be around.  A 
teacher or another trusted adult can assist. 
Look up at the person when and speak 
loudly and clearly so that the person can 
understand your need(s).   
 
Examples of needs and what can be said to tell 
others about that need. 
1. Use the bathroom – “May I use the 
bathroom, please?” 
2. Sick – My stomach/head is hurting. 
3. Bathroom Accident – “My clothes are dirty; 
may I have another shirt or pants, please?” 
4. Crossing the Street – “Would you help me 
across the street, please?” 
5. Help with Opening Something – “Can you 
open this jar for me, please?” 
Basic:  Ask students to 
introduce themselves making 
sure to give their full names, 
addresses, dates of birth and 
telephone numbers. 
 
Intermediate:  Have 
students discuss the topic, 
‘The Day I was Sick’.  Have 
them share experiences.  
Probe students to answer 
questions like ‘After you 
realized that you weren’t 
feeling well, what did you 
do?’  What should you have 
done? 
 
Advanced:  Invite a 
policeman as a guest 
speaker to provide students 
with information on how to 
keep safe.  Have students 
take turns providing personal 
information to the police or 
an authoritative figure that 
they would give if they ever 
got lost. 
 Have students 
state what they 
would say if 
they found 
themselves in 
particular 
situations

It is important to display good manners 
when speaking. 
 
Speaking Tips: 
 Greet adults and others with 
salutations such as “good morning”, 
“good afternoon”, and “good night”.  
 Look the person in the eyes. If a 
question is asked, answer the 
question politely. 
 Say “yes” or “no ma’am” or use the 
person’s name. Do not shake your 
head to indicate “yes” or “no”. 
 Say “please”, “thank you” or “no thank 
you”.    
 Say “pardon me” or “excuse me” 
when you are walking by someone or 
you make inappropriate bodily noises. 
 “May I” should be used when asking 
permission to do something. 
 
When introducing yourself to others: 
 Say your name clearly and loudly. 
 If the adult extends his/her hand, you 
may extend your right hand and 
shake it firmly. 
 Look the person in the eye. 
 Listen and respond to questions. 
 
Basic:  Read a book to students 
about having good manners.  
Discuss the book with students. 
Example:  Richard Scarry’s 
Please and Thank You Book and 
May I Please Have a Cookie? by 
Jennifer Morris.  
 
Intermediate:  Invite one or two 
administrators to your class. 
Provide a rubric for them to rate 
your students on how they 
introduce themselves and their 
handshakes.  
 
Advanced:  Provide various 
scenarios to which students can 
respond.  e.g. 
1. You are going to a movie. 
You are given your ticket. 
What should you say? 
2. A person at the concession 
stand serves you a drink and 
popcorn.  
3. You are asked if you need 
anything else, what should 
you say? 
  
Use a rubric to provide 
oral feedback to 
students on their 
speech: 
 Eye contact 
 Posture 
 Volume 
 Clarity 
 
 Please and Thank 
You

There should be a difference in the way 
things are said when speaking to family 
and friends as opposed to when 
speaking to a teacher in the classroom 
or an unfamiliar adult.  A more relaxed 
speech using Bahamian dialect is 
sometimes used with family and friends, 
while a more formal tone, using 
Standard English, is used with 
unfamiliar or unrelated adults.

When speaking, ensure that others can 
understand what is being said without 
having to strain to hear.   
 
To avoid mumbling, do the following: 
 Use lips, tongue and teeth when 
speaking.   
 Pronounce the words clearly. 
 Include all of the endings. 
 Slow down your words. 
 Keep breathing so that you do 
not run out of air. 
 
The volume used when speaking, 
should be suitable for the location. It is 
necessary to be silent, whisper, talk 
quietly, speak in a medium loud voice, 
speak loudly or scream, depending on 
location and the situation. 
 
For example, when at: 
Church - silence 
Funeral Parlour - whisper or talk 
quietly                        
Hospitals - use low volume 
Supermarket - medium loud voice 
Park - loud voice 
Being attached by a robber - scream 
Basic:  Have students do 
facial exercises that will assist 
with preparing their mouths for 
speech, such as:  opening the 
mouth really wide and then 
closing it really small, moving 
their tongues from side to side 
and then stretching out of the 
mouth. 
 
Intermediate:  In pairs have 
students take turns reading 
stories, tongue twisters or 
nursery rhymes to each other.  
 
Advanced:  Identify a 
particular phrase for students 
to say.  Provide them with a 
location.  Have them say the 
phrase using the proper 
volume for that location.  
 
 Have students recite 
a poem.  Use a 
checklist to provide 
feedback on their 
recitations.

Letters and their various patterns are 
used to represent the sounds of 
spoken language.  This is known as 
the alphabetic principle.

Phoneme segmentation is isolating  
individual sounds in a word.  Each 
individual sound can be represented 
by tapping or clapping as the sounds 
are generated. 
 
Example: 
 
The word sock has three (3) individual 
sounds. 
 
/s /o/ /ck/ 
 
The word just has four (4) individual 
sounds: 
 
/j/ /u/ /s/ /t/ 
 
---------------------------------------------- 
Basic:  Model examples of 
segmenting by cutting words 
presented on word cards/strips or 
by separating letter tiles. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
participate in a beanbag or ball 
toss. Say a word and toss the 
bag or ball to a student to have 
him or her segment the word. 
That student then tosses the bag 
or ball to another student who 
then segments another word.  
 
Advanced:  Display picture 
cards. Segment the names of 
each picture. Have students find 
the picture for the word 
segmented.

Phoneme blending is listening to a 
sequence of separately spoken 
phonemes and then combining the 
phonemes to form a word. 
 
Example:  
The sounds /f/ /a/ /s/ /t/ make the 
word fast when blended. 
 
 
Basic:  Teacher sings the 
song ‘If you think you know this 
word, shout it out!’ (Sung to the 
tune of ‘If you’re happy and 
you know it’). After singing, the 
teacher segments a word and 
allows students to say the 
blended word. 
 
Intermediate: Distribute 
picture cards to students. Ask 
them to tell how many sounds 
are in their picture name. Have 
students blend the sounds for 
classmates to guess the name 
of the picture.  
 
Advanced:  Present students 
with a list of segmented words.

Phoneme substitution is changing 
one word into a new word by 
changing any one of its sounds.  
 
Example: If the /t/ sound in the 
word ‘ten’ is changed to /m/, the 
new word is ‘men’. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students display 
True or False cards to indicate 
whether or not a phoneme 
substitution took place in two 
words called.  
Example: ‘book’ and ‘took’. Allow 
students to say where the 
substitution was and identify the 
sounds substituted.  
 
Intermediate:  Show selected 
words. Have students substitute 
the beginning/medial/final 
phoneme to form a new word. Ask

Rhyme – The same, or very similar, 
final sounds in words. 
  
Words that usually rhyme have the 
same rime.  
Example: ‘ten’ and ‘men’. 
 
However, words with different rimes 
(endings) can rhyme, like ‘ate’ and 
‘eight’. 
  
Onset is the initial consonant or 
consonant blend of the word: 
(example: the /br/ in ‘brush’). 
  
The rime is the part of a one syllable 
word that contains the vowel and 
consonants that follow it: (example: 
the ‘ush’ in ‘brush’). 
 
Basic:  Read a poem that has 
rhyming words and actions. 
Have students repeat the lines 
and do the actions. Ask 
students to identify the 
rhyming words in the poem.  
  
Intermediate: Have students 
solve riddles. In order to solve 
a riddle, the onset changes, 
but not the rime.  
Examples; The word begins 
with /b/ and rhymes with ‘fall’ 
(‘ball’).  
It begins with /r/ and rhymes 
with ‘gain’ (‘rain’). 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
read a book with rhyming 
words from a Dr. Seuss book 
or ‘Cap, Snap Rap Contest’ 
from Junka and Noo and 
record the rhyming words. 
 
 
Have students write two 
rhyming words for given

Consonants are those letters in the 
alphabet that are not vowels. 
The consonants are: b, c, d, f, g, h, 
j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, 
and z. 
  
Consonants can appear at the 
beginning, in the middle or at the 
end of words. 
  
Consonants usually represent one 
sound. However, there are some 
consonants that have two sounds, 
like ‘g’, ‘c’ and ‘x’. 
                  
 
The consonants ‘w’ and ‘y’, when 
positioned at the beginning of a 
word say their consonant sounds. 
However, when they appear in the 
medial or final positions of a word, 
they behave as vowels. 
  
 
 
 
Basic:  Place the labels (initial, 
middle, final) on the board. 
Display a picture card, give a 
consonant sound heard in the 
picture name. Have students 
stand in front of the label that 
indicates where the consonant 
sound is heard in the picture 
name.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
find pictures in magazines, 
newspapers or online with given 
consonants at the beginning, in 
the middle or at the end of 
words. Students can create a 
consonant booklet with the 
labelled pictures. 
  
Advanced:  In groups, give 
students selected consonants. 
Have students write three words 
for each consonant given. The 
consonant should appear in 
different positions in each of the 
words:  beginning, middle and 
the end.  
 
 
Call a letter and then a 
word. Have students 
write where the 
consonant sound is 
heard in the word: at the 
beginning, in the middle 
or as a final sound.

A vowel is a speech sound which is 
produced without any closure or 
blocking of the vocal tract. 
The letters, ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’ and ‘u’ are 
vowels. 
  
Short Vowels  
CVC Pattern - CVC means 
consonant – vowel- consonant.         
A vowel is usually short when it 
appears between two consonants in a 
one syllable word.   
Examples: ‘cap', ‘fit’, ‘not’ 
  
VC Pattern - VC stands for vowel – 
consonant. When a single vowel letter 
in a word or syllable is followed by a 
consonant letter, digraph, or blend, it 
usually makes its short sound. 
Examples: ‘an’, ‘it’, ‘ask’ 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
a nursery rhyme or a familiar 
song. Have them identify 
words with short vowel 
sounds. 
  
Intermediate:  Give students 
letter cards to build and read a 
word such as ‘ten.’ Then have 
them replace the vowel ‘e’ with 
‘i’ and read the new word ‘tin.’ 
Follow the same procedure to 
create additional words with 
short vowel sounds.  
  
Advanced:  Have students 
create a short vowel word / 
picture dictionary. Ask them to 
label five sheets of paper with 
the letters ‘Aa’, ‘Ee’, ‘Ii’, ‘Oo’, 
and ‘Uu’. They can draw or 
use cut-out pictures of things 
that begin with short vowel 
letters. 
 
 
Call a list of words 
containing short vowel 
sounds.  Ask students to 
write the vowel sound 
they hear in each word.

Long Vowels: 
An open phoneme (speech sound) 
in which there is no obstruction by 
the tongue, lips, or teeth of air flow.  
 
CVCE Pattern- CVCE stands for 
consonant – vowel –consonant – 
final e. In a one syllable word that 
has the CVCE pattern, the first 
vowel is usually long and the ‘e’ is 
silent.   Examples: ‘tape’, ‘five’, 
‘cove’.  
 
CVVC Pattern -Two adjacent 
vowels- When two vowels appear 
together in a word, the first vowel 
usually gives its long sound and 
the vowel that follows is silent. 
Examples: ‘seat’, ‘feet’, ‘nail/’. 
 
CV Pattern Consonant – vowel    
In a one-syllable word, the vowel 
that follows the consonant is 
usually long.   
Examples: ‘go’, ‘be’, ‘no’. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students 
participate in the activity Musical 
Chairs. Tape words with long 
vowel sounds at the back of 
chairs. Play game as usual. 
When the music stops, students 
take a seat, then rise and read 
the word taped to their chair and 
then give another word that has 
the same long vowel sound. 
  
Intermediate:  Divide the class 
into five groups. Give each group 
a vowel. Have them create about 
five CVCE words by first creating 
CVC words and adding the silent 
‘e’ at the end. Ask them to share 
the words that they created with 
the class. 
 
Advanced:  Present students 
with a list of short vowel and long 
vowel words.  Have them circle 
the long vowel words and write 
next to each of them the pattern 
that gives them their long vowel 
sounds (CVCE, CVVC and CV). 
 
Call off a list of words 
containing short or long 
vowel sounds.  Ask 
students to write the 
vowel sound they hear in 
each word and whether it 
is long or short.

Long Vowels: 
Y as a vowel 
The letter ‘y’ can sometimes have 
a vowel sound instead of a 
consonant sound.  
  
In a one syllable word the letter ‘y’ 
at the end of the word makes the 
long ‘i’ sound. 
Examples: ‘by’, ‘my’, ‘sky’ 
  
When words with more than one 
syllable end with the letter ‘y’, the 
‘y’ represents the long ‘e’ sound.    
Examples: ‘candy’, ‘happy’, ‘baby’ 
 
Basic:  Place students in a 
circle. Say words that have ‘y’ 
at the end with the long ‘’' or 
long ‘e’ sound. As words are 
said, have students clap when 
the word ends with the long ‘i’ 
sound and hop on one foot 
when they hear a word with the 
long ‘e’ sound. 
  
Intermediate:  Place three 
bags / boxes at the front of the 
room labelled ‘Y’ as a 
Consonant, ‘Y’ as Long ‘ī’ 
and ‘Y’ as Long ‘ē’. Distribute 
picture / word cards to 
students. Have students say 
their picture name / word and 
then place the picture or word 
in the correct bag or box that 
represents the sound ‘y’ is 
making in the word or picture. 
  
Advanced:  Give students 
words with ‘y’ as long ‘ē’ or 
long ‘ī’. Have them write which 
vowel sound the ‘y’ is heard as 
in each word. 
Call a list of words.  Ask 
students to write the vowel 
sound the ‘y’ is making in 
each word.

Sight words and high frequency 
words, are words that are very 
common (encountered frequently) in 
print and used in writing. 
 
 
Basic:  Play ‘musical chairs’ 
using sight words. Place word 
cards on chairs and play game 
in the usual manner. When the 
music stops, students must 
say the word on their chair 
before they sit. If child is 
unable to say the word, the 
child is out. 
 
Intermediate:  Write one letter 
per card to spell sight words. 
Create a necklace for each 
letter card. Have students 
place their letter card around 
their necks. Say a sight word. 
Students with the letters to 
spell that word should come to 
the front of the class and 
arrange themselves to spell 
the word given.  
 
Advanced:  Record given 
sentences on audio tape. Give 
students recorded sentences. 
Have students listen to tape 
and then circle the sentence 
that has the words in the same 
order as read on the tape. 
Have students read 
sentences that include 
the sight words and high 
frequency words that 
have been studied and 
that are currently being 
taught.  Build on the 
sentences as new words 
are taught.

Words are made up of parts called 
syllables. Each syllable has a vowel 
sound. Knowing about syllables helps in 
the pronunciation of words and spelling 
of words. 
 
Syllabication Rules: 
 Words with one syllable, should never 
be divided.  (Example: hand)  
 
 When one consonant appears in the 
middle of two vowels in a word, the 
syllable is usually divided after the 
consonant if the initial vowel is short. 
(Example: vis-it) 
 
 When one consonant appears 
between two vowels in a word, divide 
the word before the consonant if the 
initial vowel is long. (Example: pi-lot)  
 
 When two or more consonants 
appear between two vowels in a 
word, divide the word between the 
two consonants that are together. 
(Example: trac/tor)  
 
 Divide a compound word between the 
words that make up the compound 
word. (Example: cup-cake) 
Basic:  Give students words 
to clap out the syllables. Have 
students tell how many 
syllables are in the given 
words. 
  
Intermediate:  Divide 
students into groups.  Present 
them with about ten word 
cards and rubber bands.  
Have them work together to 
place the rubber bands 
across the place where the 
words should be divided.  
Have groups present their 
cards.  Have them identify the 
rule they were following when 
they divided the words.   
  
Advanced:  Provide students 
with a list of words.  Have 
them divide the words 
according to the syllable 
rules.  Have them use this 
information to read the words. 
 
 
 
Have students divide 
given words into 
syllables and read 
them.

Assessment 
Resources 
 
The consonants ‘c’ and ‘g’ should 
be initially introduced separately.  
 
The letter ‘c’ can be pronounced as 
/k/ or /s/.  
 
‘C’ usually makes its hard sound /k/, 
when followed by ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’. 
Example: ‘cat’  
 
‘C’ usually makes its soft sound /s/, 
when followed by ‘e’, ‘i', or ‘y’.  
Example: ‘celery’  
 
The letter ‘g’ can be pronounced as 
/g/ or /j/.  
 
‘G’ usually makes its hard sound /g/, 
when followed by ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’. 
Example: ‘goat’  
 
‘G’ usually makes its soft sound /j/, 
when followed by e, i, or y. 
Example: ‘giraffe’ 
 
 
Basic:  Label board, boxes or 
paper bags: Soft C and Hard 
C. Distribute picture or word 
cards and have students sort 
words or pictures accordingly. 
Do the same with Soft G and 
Hard G 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
play charades. Place words 
with hard and soft c and g in a 
bag. A student takes a word 
out and silently reads the 
word. The child then states 
whether the word has soft or 
hard g and acts out the word 
for the other students to guess. 
 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
read a list of words that 
contain the hard and soft c and 
g sounds. 
Present students with

A consonant digraph is two 
consonants together in a word that 
produce only one speech sound. 
Consonant digraphs can be found at 
the beginning, middle and end of 
words. 
 
Examples: 
 
Beginning 
/sh/ – ship, brush 
/th/ – three, think 
/wh/ – whale, what  
/ch/ – chin, chair 
  
Middle 
/sh/ - brushing, dishes 
/ch/ - riches, teaching 
/ck/ - kicking, clocking 
/th/ - clothing 
 
End 
/ch/ - rich, lunch 
/ck/ – black, chick 
/sh/ - wish, brush 
 
 
Basic:  Collect pictures of 
various objects that have a 
digraph in the initial, medial or 
final position. Print various 
digraphs on flash cards and 
distribute to groups of 
students. Show the class a 
picture. Instruct the group that 
has the digraph found in the 
name of the picture to stand up 
and show the digraph.   
  
Intermediate:   Distribute 
digraphs in initial and final 
positions to students. Have 
them brainstorm a list of words 
for each digraph.  Create a 
word wall of digraphs.  
 
Advanced:  Present students 
with a list of words that contain 
various diagraphs.  Have them 
decode the words. 
 
 
 
Have students complete 
words by filling in the 
blanks with the correct 
digraph. 
 
As students are 
introduced to the various 
digraphs, present them 
with sentences that 
contain words with 
digraphs that have been 
previously studied and 
those that are currently 
being studied.  Have 
them read the sentences.  
Continue to add to the 
sentences as more 
digraphs are introduced.

/oi/ in ‘soil’ 
/oy/ in ‘joy’ 
/ou/ in ‘house’  
/ow/ in ‘flower’  
  
A vowel digraph is 
two adjacent vowels that 
represent one speech sound. 
  
Examples:  
/oo/ in ‘cook’  
/ea/ in ‘ear’  
/ue/ in ‘blue’ 
 
 
Basic:   Place three chairs at the front 
of the classroom. Put the words: 
‘beginning’, ‘middle’ and ‘end’ in each 
chair. Give volunteers words containing 
diphthongs/vowel digraphs in each 
position. Have students say their word 
and sit in the appropriate chairs. 
  
Intermediate:  Set up a bus scene in 
the classroom by making two rows of 
chairs with an aisle in the middle. Give 
boarding passes to students. The 
‘boarding passes’ have 
diphthongs/vowel digraphs written on 
them. In order to get a seat on the bus 
students will have to show their 
boarding passes and say a word 
according to the position of the 
diphthong.  
  
Advanced:  Have students write 
dictated words with the diphthongs and 
vowel digraphs.

Silent consonants are letters that  
appear in a word but do not represent 
themselves with a spoken sound. 
  
Examples:  
In words beginning with /kn/ as in 
‘knee’, the /kn/ borrows the /n/ sound 
and the ‘k’ is silent.  
  
In words beginning with /wr/ as in 
‘write’, /wr/ borrows the /r/ sound and 
the ‘w’ is silent.  
 
 
 
Basic: Have students build 
ladders with words that have 
silent consonants. Ladders can 
be formed using /wr/ and /kn/ 
words.

Alphabetical order is a listing of 
names following the sequence of 
the alphabet.  
  
When alphabetizing words, the 
second and sometimes third letter 
in the name or word would have to 
be observed to correctly order 
words. 
 
 
 
Basic: Present students with a list of 
words based on a given topic 
(examples: ‘food’, ‘animals’, ‘toys’ 
etc.).  Provide students with 
Alphaboxes (boxes labelled with 
letters of the alphabet). Have 
students write/cut and paste words in 
their appropriate alpha box. 
 
Intermediate: Following a walk-a-
bout of the school grounds, have 
students create an alphabetized list 
of all of the places, people or things 
that they have observed.  
 
Advanced: Dictate a list of random 
words, have students document the 
list of words as they are called. Have 
students then alphabetize the list of 
dictated words. 
 
*Adaptation: Allow those students 
who are unable to spell the words 
from the dictated list to draw pictures 
to represent the dictated words. 
Provide support in the spelling of the 
words, in an effort to complete the 
alphabetizing of the list.     
 
Have students organize a 
word list in alphabetical 
order.

A dictionary can be a book or electronic 
resource that lists the words of a 
language (typically in alphabetical 
order) and gives their meanings.  The 
dictionary shows how to say the word, 
provides its meaning and may even use 
the word in a sentence and tell the part 
of speech.    
 
(Oxford Dictionary) 
 
Example:  ‘pigeon’ 
 
Pronunciation:  (pijon)  
 
Definition:   A bird with fat body and flat  
                   head 
 
Example Sentence: The pigeon flew  
                                 on the roof. 
Function: noun 
 
Plural form: pigeons 
 
 
Basic: Have students use a 
picture dictionary to locate 
information. 
 
Intermediate:  Play a game of 
Draw Swords. A group of 
students will stand at the back 
of the room with dictionaries 
held high; when a word is called 
the students will search the 
dictionary, find the word and 
read the meaning. Have 
particular locations identified in 
the room so that when a 
student is the first to find the 
word and read its meaning, 
he/she can advance to another 
position.  The student who 
reaches the identified “end 
position” in the room first, wins.   
 
Advanced:  Have students use 
dictionaries to complete word 
maps where students must 
document the literal meaning of 
words along with using the 
words in context.   
Have students solve 
riddles using the 
dictionary definitions of 
words.

A contraction is a shortened form of two 
words that have been placed together.  
An apostrophe (‘) is used to indicate the 
letters that have been removed.   
 
Examples:  
  
we   +   are  =  we’re  
they  +  are  =  they’re  
there  +  is   =  there’s      
I  +  have  =  I've  
you  +  are  =  you’re   
we  +  are  =  we’re   
that  +  is  =  that’s   
they  +  will  =  they’ll   
can  +  not  =  can’t  
is  +  not  =  isn’t

A base word is the simplest form of a 
word. It is also a word to which a prefix 
or suffix can be added to form a new 
word.  
 
Examples: ‘Tell’ and ‘happy’ are words to 
which a prefix and a suffix can be added. 
  
A prefix is a syllable added to the 
beginning of a word that changes the 
word’s meaning. 
 
Prefix Examples:  
‘re’ (prefix) + ‘tell’ (base word) = ‘retell’ 
 
The prefix ‘re’ means ‘again’.  The word 
‘retell’ means to tell again. 
 
‘un’ (prefix) + ‘happy’ (base) = ‘unhappy’ 
  
The prefix ‘un’ means ‘not’.  The word 
‘unhappy’ means not happy. 
 
A suffix is a syllable joined to the end of 
a word that changes its definition. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Write base words with 
prefixes on cards. Cut words 
between the base word and 
the prefix. Give each student a 
card. Have students walk 
around the room and find their 
match / partner. Have partners 
stand together and share their 
word once everyone has 
found his / her match. 
 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
sort words as base words, 
prefixes and suffixes. 
 
Advanced:  Using a 
worksheet, have students 
match prefix and base word 
with their combined meanings.  
They can do the same with 
suffixes. 
Have students create 
words using cards with 
base words, prefixes and 
suffixes.

Suffix Examples: 
‘Quick’ and ‘care’ are examples of words 
to which a suffix can be added. 
 
The suffix ‘ly’ tells how something is 
being done.   
 
‘quick’ (base word) + ‘ly’ (suffix) = 
‘quickly 
  
This means that something happened 
very fast. 
 
The suffix ‘ful’ can sometimes tell how 
something is being tended to. 
 
‘care’ (base word) + ‘ful’ (suffix) = 
‘careful’ 
 
This means that measures are being 
taken to be safe and to protect.

Objective:   2.30   Add inflectional endings (with or without) spelling changes. 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
An inflectional ending is a letter or group 
of letters added to a base word to change 
its meaning. 
-ing 
The ending ‘ing’ tells about something 
that is happening now. 
e.g. The birds are singing. 
  
-ed 
When ‘ed’ is added to the end of a word it 
tells of something that happened in the 
past. 
 e.g. The girl jumped over the rope. 
 
Whenever a short vowel word ends with 
one consonant, the last consonant is 
usually doubled before adding an ending 
that begins with a vowel. (examples: -ed / 
-ing). 
Example: hop 
hopped   hopping 
 
In a one syllable word with a long vowel 
sound and a final ‘e’, the final ‘e’ is 
dropped before adding the ending –ing. 
Examples: 
save  - save - saving 
make – make - making 
Basic:  Distribute cards that 
contain words with inflectional 
endings. Ask students to say 
their word, tell what 
inflectional ending is added 
and what it means. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
read a passage with words 
with inflectional endings. Ask 
students to underline the 
words, then, sort words 
underlined using headings: 
Now / Past. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students 
with a list of base words in 
one column and the 
inflectional ending to be 
added in another column.  In 
the third column have 
students combine the two 
using the rules provided, to 
produce the correct spelling.   
Dictate sentences to 
students with words that 
have inflectional endings.  
Assess their spelling of 
these words.

There are specific punctuation marks 
that give cues as to how a particular 
sentence should be read. 
 
Period/Full Stop – Pause and take a 
breath before reading the next 
sentence. 
Example: Today is the first day of 
school.  I just made two new friends. 
 
Comma – Give a slight pause after the 
comma.  Reading too fast or too slowly 
can change the meaning of a sentence. 
Example:. Ms. Smith, my new teacher, 
sent me to the office to get some paper. 
 
Question Mark – Raise your voice at 
the end of a sentence, when there is a 
question mark. This indicates that a 
response may be required.

It is important when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at which 
you are reading, the rise and fall of your 
voice and expression. 
 
Pace – Refers to how fast or how 
slowly someone is speaking.  Be 
careful not to speak so slowly that 
listeners lose interest. Do not read too 
quickly, otherwise the words may not 
be clear and the listeners may find it 
difficult to follow. 
 
Intonation – The rise and fall of the 
voice to reflect what is happening in the 
reading piece. 
 
Vocal Expression – The tone of the 
reader should reflect the mood of the 
piece.  
Examples: 
Sad Mood - Read slowly, lower the 
voice. 
Angry Mood – Loud, booming voice 
Happy Mood – Light, medium fast voice  
 
Pitch of Voice - Refers to the loudness 
or softness of the voice. 
Basic:   Have students listen to 
a radio drama.  Have them 
discuss the pace, intonations 
and vocal expressions utilized 
by the actors. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide 
students with the same 
sentence to read.  Place 
different emotions on slips of 
paper in a bag.  Have students 
take turns selecting a slip.  
Have them read the line in such 
a way as to portray that 
emotion.  They should use 
intonations, variations in pace 
and expression to capture the 
mood.  Have students identify 
the mood that is being 
portrayed. 
 
Advanced:  Have students take 
turns reading a passage.  
Remind them to pay attention to 
the pacing and their 
expressions.  Allow students to 
give feedback on their reading. 
Have students complete a 
fluency assessment.  Use 
a rubric to score their 
efforts.

In order to make stories interesting, 
authors include characters, setting, 
plot and a theme.  These are 
called story elements. 
 
Character: The people or animals 
in a story are the characters. 
Stories can tell what characters 
look like, what they think, how they 
feel and what they say and do. 
 
Setting: Where a story takes place 
and the time of day that it takes 
place, is called the setting. The 
setting can be a real or a make-
believe place. 
  
Plot: The plot has a beginning, 
middle, and end. It is usually made 
up of the most important events of 
the story. Short stories usually 
have one plot or event. 
 
Theme(s): The theme is the main 
message. 
Basic:  Select students to act as 
characters for an interview during a talk 
show. The host of the talk show can ask 
the characters questions such as:  
1. Who are you?     
2. What did you do? 
3. Where were you when you did it? 
4. What were some of the important things that  
    happened? 
  
Intermediate:  Have students read a text 
at the appropriate reading level.  
Construct a visual diagram and have 
students record the elements of the story 
on the diagram in a group, in pairs or 
individually. 
 Who?    Did What?   When?  
 Where?   How?       Why? 
  
Advanced: Have students work in pairs 
to identify the elements of a story. 
Setting: Tell where the story takes place. 
Character(s): Tell the names of the 
characters and if they are good, bad, 
helpful, mean, funny, etc. 
Problem: Tell what the problem is. 
Solution: Tell how the problem was 
solved. 
 
Read a story and 
have students 
identify the various 
story elements.

Context clues help the reader figure out 
the meaning of unfamiliar words while 
reading. Context clues may be in the 
same sentence as the unknown words.  
There are several ways to figure out 
their meanings. 
 
1. Examples – Clues about the 
meanings of words can be found in 
the examples that are given 
following the unfamiliar words. The 
word is often followed by “like” or 
“such as”.   
Example:  Insects, like ants or flies, 
                 like to be near food.  
 
2. Synonyms – Sometimes authors 
use words that are similar in 
meaning to the unfamiliar words to 
explain them. 
      Example:  The dense fog was thick  
                       and heavy. 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students read 
rebus sentences where 
examples and synonym clues 
are provided. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
read sentences where example 
clues are given.  Have them 
use this information to explain 
the meanings of the words. 
 
Advanced: Have students read 
sentences that utilize examples 
and synonyms as context clues.  
Have them use these clues to 
explain the meanings of the 
words. 
 
Have students complete a 
worksheet where they 
have to use the clues 
provided in order to 
understand the meaning 
of unfamiliar words.

When reading or writing paragraphs 
and stories, events must be placed 
in the correct order to understand 
what is being read.   We refer to this 
as the sequence of events. 
  
The sequence of events is also 
important when following directions.  
When we follow a recipe, for 
example, we need to follow the steps 
so that the item we are making is 
done correctly. 
  
Clue words such as first, next, 
then, after that, and last help the 
reader to understand the order in 
which certain events happened.   
  
Words such as morning, night and 
evening also tell the order in which 
events happened. 
Basic:  Place sentences from a nursery 
rhyme on sentence strips.  Have 
students place them in the correct 
order. 
  
Intermediate:  Gather comic strips from 
a newspaper. Cut them apart.  Glue the 
separate panels on a stiffer piece of 
paper, then laminate.  
(Put the correct number on the back of 
each piece to show sequence.)  
Have students take turns putting the 
panels in the correct order. 
  
Advanced: Place footprints around the 
classroom at designated spots, for 
example: next to supplies that have 
been knocked off a desk, a desk that 
has been tipped over and next to a book 
in the reading corner.     
Have students follow the footprints and 
observe what took place at each stop. 
Ask students to write about the order in 
which the person moved around the 
classroom, using sequencing words. 
 
 
Have students read a 
simple story.  Have 
students number 
sentences to indicate 
the order in which the

Authors sometimes use their 
imaginations to help them write 
interesting stories.  Stories about 
fairies, talking animals and objects 
are not real.  We call these types of 
stories make-believe or fiction. 
  
Books that give us information about 
a person’s life, things that actually 
happened and places that people can 
actually go and visit are considered 
real life or non-fiction. 
 
 
Basic:   Read various scenarios. 
Have the children hold up an ‘M’ 
card for Make-believe and an ‘R’ 
card for Real Life. The teacher 
can ask individual students to 
explain why they held up the 
cards that they did.

work in pairs or a group to read a 
given passage.  Have them 
determine whether the passage is 
fiction or non-fiction.  Give

A fact is a statement that can be proven 
true or false.  This may be done 
through further reading or by asking an 
adult. 
 
Example: 
Christmas Day is on a Monday this 
year. 
 
This is a statement of fact.  It can be 
proven true or false by checking the 
calendar.   
 
An opinion tells how someone thinks or 
feels about a particular topic.  As a 
result, it cannot be proven true or false. 
 
Words that tell how someone feels 
such as thinks or likes, can be used to 
tell opinions.   
 
Example:  Cookies and Cream is the 
best ice cream in the world. 
 
This is an opinion because it expresses 
how this person feels about Cookies 
and Cream ice cream. 
 
Basic: Read a variety of 
sentences. Have the students 
display the ‘F’ card for Fact and 
the ‘O’ card for Opinion. The 
teacher can call on individual 
students to explain why they held 
up the card that they did. 
  
Intermediate:  During guided 
reading, have students go on a 
fact hunt. As they find the facts, 
they can list them on a group 
chart. Each group can then share 
their facts with the class.   
  
Advanced: Have each individual 
select five sentences from a bag 
from the centre of their group.  
Provide them with a Fact and 
Opinion chart. Have them write the 
sentences in the correct column. 
In the third column, ask them to 
explain the reason for their 
answer.

statements are factual

When summarizing, give only 
the main idea of a story or 
passage and one or two 
details that will explain what it 
is all about. 
 
 
Basic:   Have students choose a book 
to read.  Ask them to select three (3) 
items that were in the story to help them 
re-tell the story in three sentences.  If 
possible, the items can be physically 
brought to the class so that they can be

One thing may make another thing 
happen.  The reason why it happened 
is called the cause. The words 
because and since may be used to 
signal a cause. What happened is 
called the effect. The words therefore 
and as a result may be used to signal 
an effect.   
 
Basic:  Give students five 
picture cards showing cause 
and effect. Have them play a 
concentration game in which 
they match the cause to the 
correct effect. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
find the cause and effect 
relationships in popular nursery 
rhymes like Little Miss Muffet. 
  
Advanced: Read a nonfiction 
text and with the assistance of 
the students, write the causes 
of a particular problem and 
effect on a fishbone Graphic 
Organizer. The effects will be 
written on the backbone while 
the causes will be written on the 
bones branching out from the 
backbone.

Authors do not always tell everything in 
a story or in an article.  However, the 
reader can combine several clues 
along with what they already know to 
figure out what is happening. The clues 
may be pictures or words.            
 
 
 
Basic:  Divide students into 
small groups.  Give each group 
a bag.  Each bag should have 
items related to a particular 
sport.  Example: ‘bat’, ‘ball’, 
‘uniform’, etc.  Have students 
use the clues to guess the 
sport.  (If actual items cannot be 
located, pictures can also be 
used.) 
  
Intermediate: Show students a 
short clip from a movie.   Ask 
students to tell what is 
happening based on clues and 
their experiences.  Ask them to 
put the clues and facts together 
to draw a conclusion about the 
clip.

A proverb is a common saying or 
phrase that is used to give advice or 
explain what is believed to be true, 
based on experience.  Some common 
proverbs are: 
 
Actions speak louder than words. 
People watch what we do more than 
listen to what we say.   
 
Idle hands are the Devil’s workshop. 
If we do not keep ourselves busy, then 
we might easily get into trouble. 
 
A stitch in time saves nine. 
We should deal with problems and 
issues right away so that they do not 
build up and become difficult to handle. 
 
Don’t judge a book by its cover. 
Some books may not have a very 
appealing cover but they can still be 
very interesting.  Sometimes we miss 
out on knowing people and 
opportunities because they may not 
appear to be interesting at first.  We 
should avoid doing this. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students discuss an 
event that happened in their lives 
when one of the proverbs might 
have applied. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
match the proverbs with certain 
fairy tales or other stories. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
Aesop’s Fables and discuss the 
meaning of the proverbs.  Have 
them identify other stories to which 
the proverbs might apply. 
 
Have students match 
specific proverbs with 
situations presented.  
Have them explain why 
they paired the two.

A sentence is a group of words that 
express a complete idea or 
thought.    
Example: We like to play in the 
park.  
 
Sentences should begin with a 
capital letter and end with an end 
mark. There are three different end 
marks: period (.), question mark (?) 
and exclamation point/mark (!). 
 
A fragment is a group of words that 
do not express a complete thought, 
although the first word might be 
capitalized and a punctuation mark 
follows at the end.   
Example: The day he came 
 
Basic:  Have students play the “Jump 
on It” game where they will have to 
differentiate between sentences and 
fragments. Tape/place sentence strips 
or sentence cards throughout the 
classroom and have students, 3 at a 
time, hop on all sentences/fragments. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students work in 
pairs to create simple sentences, 
using word cards and punctuation 
cards. 
 
Advanced: Present students with a 
group of sentences and fragments. 
Have them read each group of words; 
writing “F” (fragment) if the group of 
words is a fragment or “S” if the group 
of words is a sentence. 
 
Present students with 
a list of phrases and 
sentences and ask 
them to categorize 
them as sentences or 
fragments

There are four types of sentences.  
A statement, called a telling 
sentence, tells something. The end 
mark used for telling sentences is the 
period/full stop (.). 
Example:  I live in a green house. 
 
A question, called an asking 
sentence, asks something. Questions 
end with a question mark (?).  
Questions usually begin with special 
words such as: would, should, why, 
who, what, when, where, how, is, are 
and will. 
Example:  What is the colour of your 
house? 
 
An exclamatory sentence shows 
strong feelings. It begins with a capital 
letter and ends with an exclamation 
point(!) . 
Example:  Yikes, I lost my homework 
again! 
 
A command sentence gives an order. 
It ends with a period/full stop. 
Example: Give Nate his pencil. 
Basic:  Have students play the 
game, “Tag that Sentence”.  
Read various types of 
sentences and then have 
students raise their hashtag 
cards to indicate the type of 
sentence read.  
Example: Would you be more 
comfortable on the couch? 
  #statement             
#question 
 
Intermediate:  In pairs, have 
students dictate and record 
exclamatory sentences and 
commands about given pictures 
or items.  
                                              
Advanced:  Present students 
with random pictures. Have 
students compose a minimum 
of four sentences for each of 
the two sentence types 
(command and exclamatory). 
Have students complete 
sentences by choosing 
the correct punctuation 
mark.

A run-on sentence is made up of two 
or more sentences that have been 
joined incorrectly. These types of 
sentences can sometimes go on and 
on.  
 
Example: 
Byron got up late he missed the bus. 
 
Run-on sentences can be corrected 
by placing the conjunction and between 
the sentences. 
 
Byron got up late and he missed the 
bus.  
 
Run-on sentences can also be 
corrected by separating them into two 
different sentences.  
 
Byron got up late. He missed the bus. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students take 
turns picking a sentence from a 
bag. Have them tell if the 
sentence is a run-on sentence. 
 
Intermediate: Using sentence 
strips, have students add 
punctuation marks and capital 
letters in the run-on sentence in 
order to make it two sentences. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
complete a worksheet where 
they will have to correct run-on 
sentences.   
Have students divide run-
on sentences into simple 
sentences by inserting 
periods and capital letters 
at the correct points in the 
run-on sentences.

Nouns, also called naming words, 
are words that name a person, place, 
animal or thing.  
 
Common nouns do not name a 
particular person, place, animal or 
thing. 
Examples: 
Person:   father 
Place:      island 
Animal:   bird          
Thing:     airplane 
 
Proper nouns name a special 
person, place, animal or thing. Proper 
nouns begin with a capital letter. 
Days of the week, months of the year 
and holidays are proper nouns. 
Examples: 
Person:   Sam Kemp 
Place:      Inagua 
Animal:   Polly          
Thing:     Bahamasair 
 
 
 
 
Basic: Students will play a game 
called Concentration. In this 
game, each student will give a 
noun for the selected category 
when called upon.  
Example: 
Name of a person = Mary 
Name of a place = Nassau  
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
play the game Noun Storm.  
When given a particular letter, 
students will have ten seconds to 
brainstorm as many nouns as 
they can think of that begin with 
that letter.     
 
Advanced:  Students will work in 
groups of four to identify nouns in 
a poem or another kind of writing. 
They will state if they are 
common or proper nouns.   
Have students circle the 
nouns in a given list of 
sentences.  Have 
students determine if the 
circled nouns are 
common or proper nouns.

A singular noun names one person, 
place, animal or thing. 
Nouns that name two or more people, 
places, animals or things are called 
plural nouns. 
Some nouns add ‘s’ to name more than 
one.  
 
Add ‘es’ to words that end with: ‘ch’, 
‘sh’, ‘ss’, ‘x’ and  ‘z’ to name more 
than one person, place, animal or thing. 
 
Examples: 
witch       witches 
bush        bushes 
glass       glasses 
box          boxes 
quiz         quizzes 
Basic:  Have students compile 
and illustrate a book that 
contains singular and plural 
nouns.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
play the game, “Teacher May 
I?”.  For this game, give 
students different nouns.  Have 
them decide whether to 
add ‘s’ or ‘es’ to the noun to 
form the plural name.  Students 
will then ask, “Teacher may I?”  
Once the teacher says, “Yes, 
you may” students will proceed 
to write the noun on the board 
and add the appropriate 
ending.  
Examples: 
book = books  
fox = foxes.  
  
Advanced:  Have students 
match the singular nouns with 
the correct plural nouns. Have 
students write sentences using 
the plural forms of the nouns.   
 
Have students illustrate 
then write sentences 
about each picture to 
show one or more than 
one.

A possessive noun shows ownership. 
 
Most singular possessive nouns are 
formed by adding an apostrophe (‘) 
and the letter ‘s’ to the noun. 
 
Example: The horse’s tail is black. 
 
If a plural noun ends with the letter ‘s’, 
the possessive noun is formed by 
adding only an apostrophe (‘) after 
the ‘s’. 
 
Example:  These are the girls’ dolls. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students pick 
noun cards from the class word 
wall or word box.  Have them

Pronouns are words that are used 
in place of nouns. The words ‘I’, 
‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘they’, ‘we’, ‘our’, 
‘us’, and ‘it’ are examples of 
pronouns. 
 
Example: 
Mary and Jan like ice-cream. 
They like ice-cream. 
The pronoun ‘they’ replaces the 
nouns Mary and Jan. 
 
Use ‘I’ and ‘me’ to talk about 
yourself.  ‘I’ is always capitalized 
when it stands alone as a word.  
When talking about yourself and 
someone else, always say the 
other person’s name first. 
Example: 
Jerry and I are going to the park.  
 
The pronoun ‘me’ is used after an 
action verb. 
Example: 
The lizards jumped on Jan and 
me. 
Basic:  Have students play the I 
Spy game, based on the characters 
of a story/nursery rhyme. 
Example: “I spy with my little eye a

A word that shows action is called a 
verb and is sometimes referred to as 
an action word.  
Examples: jump, jog, hit, swim 
 
Some verbs help the action verb or 
main verb by telling when something 
happened. They are called helping 
verbs.  Helping verbs can be singular 
or plural. 
 
Singular             Plural 
is                          are 
was                      were 
am 
has                       have 
had 
does                     do 
 
The helping verb ‘have’ is used with the 
pronouns ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’ and ‘they’.  
 
Personal Singular 
‘I’  
Use ‘am’ when the subject is ‘I’, in the 
present tense.  
 
Singular Pronouns 
‘he’, ‘she’ and ‘it’  
Use ‘is’ when the subject is a singular  
Basic:  Have students listen to a 
poem and follow the instructions to 
complete the actions. Ask them to 
identify action verbs from the poem.  
Example: 
Hands 
I have two hands that clap and tap 
When I’m tired, I lay them in my 
lap. 
My hands bend, wave and clip, 
They can use scissors to snip, snip, 
snip 
Patricia B.L. Dean 
 
Intermediate:  Have students play 
Word Theatre. Place verbs in a 
bag. Have a student blindly select a 
word from the bag and then 
demonstrate/act-out the verb 
chosen without any spoken cues. 
Another student will guess the verb 
being demonstrated until the 
correct word is called.  
 
Advanced:  Using strips of paper, 
have students create sentence 
chains/links. Using specific colours, 
 
Have students identify 
the action and helping 
verbs in sentences.

There are special ways to say or write 
verbs to tell when something happens.  
For actions that are happening now, the 
present tense is used. For actions that 
have already happened, the past tense 
is used. For actions that are still to 
happen the future tense is used.  
 
Present Tense: 
If the noun is singular (representing one) 
an ‘s’ is added to the verb. 
Example: Ben sings in church.  
When using the pronouns, ‘he’, ‘she’ and 
‘it’, add an ‘s’ to the verb to indicate the 
present tense.  
Example: She jumps into the water. 
 
If the noun is plural, no ‘s’ is added to 
the verb.      
Example: They jump into the water.    
 
Present Tense      
The suffix,‘ing’ can also be added to a 
verb to tell that something is happening 
now.   
Example: Jan is playing in the band. 
 
 
Basic: On the chart provided, fill in 
the missing form of the verb.  
 
Subject

Intermediate: Present students with 
sentence strips and three clothespins 
labelled ‘s’, ‘ed’ and ‘ing’. Have 
students add the appropriate ending 
to the verb in each sentence. 
 
Advanced:  Present students with a 
group of sentences on a worksheet. 
Have students provide the correct 
tense of the verb to make the 
sentence complete. 
 
Example: Sarah ____ through the 
window. 
Verb: jump

a verb and expresses a complete 
thought.  
Example: Stan took an apple.  
Two simple sentences can be joined 
to make one complete sentence. These 
simple sentences can be joined using 
the word ‘and’.  
Example: 
Stan took an apple.  
He ate it by the pool. 
 
Stan took an apple and he ate it by the 
pool.  
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students join two 
sentences using the conjunction 
‘and’. 
 
Intermediate:  Have a student 
create a simple sentence.  
Example: The boy ran onto the 
beach.  
 
Have another student expand it 
into a compound sentence. 
Example: The boy ran onto the 
beach and he dashed into the 
water.  
 
Advanced:  Have students play 
a KAHOOT game where they 
must identify simple and 
compound sentences. Ask 
students to justify their 
responses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students join two 
simple sentences 
together with the 
conjunctions ‘and’, ‘or’, or

An interjection can be one word 
or a group of words that express 
strong emotions like excitement, 
anger, dismay or surprise.   
 
Some examples of interjections 
are: hey, oh, gee, oops, ouch, 
hooray, and wow                         
 
Interjections are followed by an 
exclamation mark (!). 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students match the 
pictures of situations or events with 
the correct interjection. 
Examples: 
Picture             Interjection 
hitting toe               Ouch! 
winning a game      Hooray! 
falling glass            Oops! 
 
Intermediate:  Distribute interjection 
word cards to students. Have 
students listen to a passage. As the 
interjection is heard in the story, have 
students holding the interjection word 
card stand and display the word.   
 
Advanced:  Present a cloze 
passage in which students will use 
context clues to select the 
interjection that will best complete 
the passage. 
 
Example: 
 “___! Mr. Rolle’s car is so cool!” 
(Wow) 
 
“___! That cat is scary!” (Yikes) 
 
 
Have students use 
interjections in sentences.

When writing, how the story or piece 
begins is very important.  The writer 
should try to grab the attention of the 
person who is reading the piece right 
away. This can be done in several 
ways. 
 
 Begin with a question.  Have you 
ever fallen out of bed? 
 
 Start with lots of action.  Mr. Rolle 
held tightly on to his line.  Suddenly, 
the fish gave a big jerk and pulled 
the line out of Mr. Rolle’s hands. 
 
 Use sound words.  Clip-clop, clip-
clop went the horse as it pulled the 
carriage filled with tourist down 
Shirley Street. 
 
 Begin with words that sound 
alike.  Hungry, hot and hurt, the 
man sat quietly on the rock 
 
 
Basic:  Have students make a 
collection of sound words that 
they can easily access when 
they are writing.  Have them 
draw a picture on one side of 
the card and the word 
representing the sound made, 
on the other side of the card. 
Ask leading questions like, 
“What does the duck say?”  
Have them select an 
appropriate sound word to 
begin a piece of writing.  
 
Intermediate:  Ask students to 
write about the Needs of Living 
Things or another Social 
Science topic.  Have them 
begin the piece with a question. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
watch a movie clip that begins 
with a lot of action.  Have them 
capture the beginning in their 
writing. 
 
Have students write a 
paragraph with an 
interesting introduction.  
Use a rubric to assess.

sure to use the senses in 
describing people, places and 
things.

Many people can tell the same story 
about an experience but it will be 
different for each of them because they 
all looked at what happened in different 
ways. 
 
Use words such as: ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’ and 
‘we’ to tell a story about you. 
 
Use words such as: ‘you’ and ‘yours’ to 
tell the story as if someone else is 
watching what happens. 
 
Use ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’ and’ they’ when you 
are watching the story unfold. 
 
Sometimes the writer can pretend to be 
an animal or object to tell their side of 
the story. 
 
 
Basic:  Have a student hold a 
camera in front and video tape 
himself walking along the 
sidewalk.  Then have another 
student videotape him walking 
down the same sidewalk.  
Share both views with the class.  
Discuss any similarities and 
differences.  Relate it to writing. 
 
Intermediate:  Read the Seven 
Blind Mice by Ed Young or a 
similar story.  The Mice 
discover something mysterious 
by the pond.  Each feels a 
different part of the object and 
comes up with his own theory 
as to what it is.  Relate this to 
having different viewpoints in 
writing. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
imagine that they are a mango 
tree with lots of mangoes next 
door to a school. Ask them to 
write about the experiences that 
the tree would have.

Poems are a fun way of expressing our 
ideas and thoughts.  They can come in 
many different forms.  
Rhyming Poems  
In rhyming poems, the words at the end 
of line pairs rhyme. There should be 
about the same number of words in the 
line pairs that rhyme so that the flow of 
the poem is consistent.  
  
Cinquains  
The Cinquain (/ˈsɪŋkeɪn/ is a five-line 
poem. Each line has a specific number 
of words as well as type of words.  
Line One –    1 word (noun)  
Line Two –    2 words (adjectives that   
                      describe the noun in line 1)  
Line Three – 3 words (action)  
Line Four –   4 words (longer description)  
Line Five –    1 word (noun that relates to the  
                      noun in line 1)  
 
List Poems  
List poems are written as lists.  They 
may simply have a list of words or there 
may be a common phrase in each 
line.  All of the lines refer to the person 
or thing that the poem is about.  
 
Basic:  Have students make a 
class poem.  The teacher can 
provide the stem of the poem 
and have students provide the 
rhyming words at the end.  
Intermediate: Provide students 
with stimulating pictures such 
as a delicious chocolate cake or 
an ice cream topped with a 
variety of toppings.  Have 
them write a Cinquain poem 
about the picture.  
Advanced:   Have 
students write a list poem about 
a current Science or Social 
Studies topic.  
 
Have students write a

Writing stories is a way of telling about 
something that happened.  Stories 
should have a beginning, middle and 
an end.   
 
Stories should tell about animals or 
people that are included in the events. 
These are called story characters.  
What did they say?  How did they look?  
Where did they go? 
 
Stories should also give an idea of 
where the events are happening...in 
school? at the fair? on Crooked Island?  
This is called the setting or the place 
where the stories are taking place. 
 
Stories should give a problem and 
explain how it is solved.  This is called 
the plot. 
 
 
Basic: Have students listen to a 
simple song that tells a story.  
Have them identify the 
characters, setting and plot.   
 
Intermediate:  Ask students to 
write a story about a big 
surprise.  Have students first 
draw pictures of the characters 
in their stories.  Have them use 
details from their pictures to tell 
more about the characters in 
their writing pieces. 
 
Advanced:  Have students look 
at pictures from a magazine, 
calendar or on the internet to 
pick a setting for their stories.  
Let them take a little time to 
write about what it looks like.  
Have them incorporate these 
descriptions in their stories.

In descriptive writing it is important to 
describe people, animals, places, 
items etc. in such detail that readers 
can picture them in their minds as 
they read.  
Using the senses to help build 
descriptions is key.  Include what you 
can see, feel, taste, smell or hear.  
Comparing one thing to another is 
another way of helping with 
descriptions.  
Example; The dog’s bark was as 
sharp as a whistle. 
 
 
Basic: Select a simple paragraph 
that is particularly rich in sensory 
detail. Present a copy of the 
paragraph to each child. Read 
through the paragraph together 
and have the students identify 
(circle) the describing words. 
  
Intermediate: Select a simple 
paragraph from a basal reader. 
Create a cloze paragraph by 
adding or leaving blank spaces 
where adjectives were or could be 
added. Have the students read 
and then write their own describing 
words to complete the paragraph. 
  
Advanced:  Give each child a 
paragraph frame with a topic 
sentence describing an animal or 
thing.  Examples: My dog is very 
funny. or Oranges are very juicy. 
Have the students write two or 
three more descriptive sentences 
to support the topic sentence. 
 
 
Have students write a 
descriptive piece.  Use a

In addition to writing stories and 
describing events or people, there is a 
type of writing that just gives directions 
or provides information. We call this 
type of writing, expository writing.  
 
Examples of expository writing are: 
 
 Classroom Rules 
 Textbooks 
 Instructions 
 Book Reports 
 Recipes 
 Flyers 
 Invitations 
 
When explaining how to do something, 
begin with a sentence that tells what 
you will be writing about. Use sequence 
words to help order the steps. End with 
a sentence that tells what was just 
done, but in another way. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
examples of expository writing 
from the radio.  Discuss their 
purpose.  Have students 
identify examples of expository 
writing in their environment. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide 
students with excerpts from 
narrative, descriptive and 
expository pieces.  Have them 
identify the expository ones. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
write information about their 
school to share with a friend 
who is interested in attending. 
 
 
 
Have students write an

Friendly letters are written to provide our 
family and friends information about what is 
happening in our lives. Friendly letters 
should include:  
The Heading - This includes the date. It is 
normally written in the right-hand corner and 
tells when the letter was written.  
Salutation or Greeting - This is the way to 
identify the person to whom you are writing.  
It usually begins with “Dear” and is written 
on the left side of the paper. 
The Body of the Letter – This is considered 
the main part of the letter where you may 
include all of the interesting details about 
your family and friends and write about what 
you have been doing, your hobbies etc.   
The Closing – This is a way of ending the 
letter or signing off.  “Love” and “Your best 
friend” are examples that are used.  The first 
word in the closing is always capitalized.  
Signature – This identifies by name the 
person who is writing the letter. 
 
Basic:  Present students with a 
chart showing a friendly letter.  
Have the names for different 
parts of a friendly letter written

The Reading Block 
 
The Reading Block for lower primary refers to the 90-minute double period dedicated exclusively for the teaching of 
reading.  This daily instructional block encourages the integration of the five components of reading: phonemic 
awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension.  Within this block, time should be allocated for guided 
reading, where teachers hear students read in small groups as well as individually.   
 
Useful Information about the Teaching of Reading 
 
 
READING LEVELS 
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% 
comprehension rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the 
information with at least 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate. 
 
 
Basal Readers 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-leveled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-
appropriate reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, 
comprehension skills and vocabulary skills.

Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
  
The Language Experience Approach 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on 
the board or on chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the 
language arts components (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and helps the children to see relationships: “What I 
can think about, I can talk about. What I can say, I can read. What I can read, I can write.” 
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Guided Reading: 
Guided Reading refers to teachers working with students in small groups to provide support in reading and 
comprehending designated texts.     
 
Oral Reading: 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
As the teacher listens to and observes the students read orally, the checklist can be used as guide to assess students’ 
oral reading abilities. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The 
checklist also helps the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.

Sample Checklist for Oral Reading 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings in relation to the content subjects and 
daily living experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in 
Social Studies, Science and Arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, 
the more demand for reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for 
pleasure. Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  Lifetime interest 
in good books comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational 
reading, the teacher must know children’s books, know the students’ ability and interests and be ready to help students 
find the right books at the right time.  Students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide 
gradation of difficulty that can be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting 
classroom libraries and encourage students to visit their school libraries.

Important Phonics Rules 
  
 
1. The letter ‘c’ has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /k/ or /s/.  It is pronounced /k/ when it is followed by a, o or 
u as in words like ‘can’, ‘cough’ and ‘cut’.  ‘C’ makes its soft sound /s/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words 
like ‘cent’, ‘city’ and ‘cycle’. 
 
2. The letter ‘g’ has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /g/ or /j/.  It makes its hard sound /g/ when it is followed by 
a, o or u as in words like ‘gate’, ‘goat’ or ‘got’.  ‘G’ makes its soft sound /j/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in 
words like ‘gem’, ‘gills’ or ‘gym’.  There are some exceptions to this rule as in words like ‘get’, ‘give’ and ‘gift’. 
 
3. The CVC pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel and then another consonant.  When 
this happens, the vowel usually gives its shorts sound.  Examples are words like ‘bed’, ‘man’ and ‘hat’.  
 
4. The Final ‘e’ or CVCE pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel, another consonant and 
a final e.  In instances where this occurs, the first vowel gives its long sound (says its name) and the e is silent.  
Examples of words that follow this pattern are ‘made’, ‘hole’, ‘cube’ and ‘date’. 
 
5. The CV pattern refers to words that only have one syllable.  In these two-letter words, the vowel normally gives its 
long sound as in words like ‘go’ and ‘me’.  Some one-syllable words do not follow this pattern as in words like ‘to’ 
and ‘do’. 
 
6. R-Controlled vowels refer to vowels that are followed by the letter ‘r’.  When this happens, the sound of the ‘r’ 
usually dominates the vowel sound, and the sound that the vowel makes is neither a short or a long sound.  Words 
like ‘cart’, ‘far’ and ‘for’ are examples of the r-controlled sounds. 
 
7. When ‘gh’ follows ‘i’, the ‘i’ gives its long sound and the ‘gh’ is silent.  ‘Thigh’ and ‘right’ are examples of this rule. 
 
8. In words that begin with ‘kn’ and ‘wr’, only the sound for the second letter is heard.  In the words ‘knot’ and ‘wreck’ 
the ‘n’ and ‘r’ sounds are heard. 
                                                                                                                                                    Adapted from Language Arts by Gail Tompkins

Vowel Generalizations 
 
The following are some of the most common vowel generalizations. 
 
a. In one syllable words containing two vowel letters (one of which is a final e) the first vowel usually represents a long 
vowel sound, the e is silent. (e.g. kite, bite). 
b. In a one-syllable word that ends with a vowel, the vowel that follows the consonant is usually long (e.g. he, go – 
open syllable). 
c. A vowel is usually short when it appears between two consonants in a one-syllable word (e.g. hat, fox, dig – closed 
syllable). 
d. When i is followed by gh, nd,  or ld, the i usually represents its long sound (e.g. find, child, light). 
e. The vowel o followed by –ld usually has a long sound (e.g. old).  
f. If the only vowel in a word or syllable is an a followed by w, ll and u, the sound of the a is usually that of a short o 
(e.g. wall).  
g. When two vowels appear together in a word, the first vowel usually gives its long sound and the vowel that follows 
is silent. This rule is usually consistent with ai, oa, ee and ay combinations. 
h. Each vowel letter may represent the soft schwa sound often heard in the unaccented syllable (e.g. disappear, 
telegram). 
Y functions as a vowel when it concludes words of more than one syllable (e.g. dad/dy) and it follows a vowel (e.g.)

4. oil 
 
    pronounced /oy/l ; not “earl” 
5. kettle

6. stamp 
    pronounced with a short ‘a’ sound as in “tam”; “stamp”, not “stump” 
7. mine  
    possessive; no ‘s’ is to be added; not “mines”

Writing Instruction 
 
Daily Written Composition 
The timetable for the Lower Primary Grades provides daily periods for Written Composition instruction with a total of five 
(5) periods weekly.  In some instances, a daily allotment of 30 minutes for written composition may not be feasible; hence, 
the time allotment for instruction is five periods per week.  According to research and best practices being currently used, 
composition writing should follow a balanced literacy approach.    
 
Instructional Strategy: 10 Day Writing Plan   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
The “Ten Day Writing Plan” is a pilot writing model developed to support the daily teaching of written composition. This 
plan can be adapted for use at all primary grades.  It is research based and contains the following components of good 
writing instruction: 
 
· Mentor Texts 
· Enriching Experiences to Build Background Knowledge 
· Vocabulary Building Activities 
· The Writing Process 
· Writing Instructional Strategies 
- Modelled Writing 
- Interactive Writing 
 
The W.A.V.E is an acronym that is used to indicate what should be included a good piece of writing.  The letters refer to: 
Wonderful Introduction 
Add a Topic Sentence 
Very Specific Details 
Exciting Ending
