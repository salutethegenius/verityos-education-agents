BELIEF STATEMENTS   
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student centered; 
2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make decisions as well as to develop self- 
confidence and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme 
and should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing 
sixth grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our 
students receive at the primary level, lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that 
students are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on the communication skills.  During this particular period in our history, knowledge of the basic 
communication skills is essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and 
more people are being pushed to use on-line services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct 
banking transactions, to pay bills, to make travel arrangements, to access government services and so much more.   
Additionally, changes in technology demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Land lines, 
that only required listening and speaking skills for its use, have been replaced with smart phones and computers where 
we can communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the 
internet, buy tickets, post to Facebook, create blogs, Snapchat, conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the 
world and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be that confidence in our education system that students 
will be prepared to communicate effectively in spite of the changes that occur.  Recognizing that the Language Arts skills 
are the foundation of all learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on 
producing students who are not only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability 
to communicate effectively in a rapidly advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves 
creatively, to collaborate and to problem solve as we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which 
speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education for all...”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of 
Oracy, Reading and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that 
they will need to become life-long learners and to navigate successfully in an ever-changing world.

Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM  
 
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, 
teachers should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area 
subjects and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual fieldtrips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centers, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level in order to provide teachers and parents with a guide 
for what students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This 
information should be used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also provides an 
indication of the level of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become 
proficient in a particular area, teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted in 
order to make them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the 
end of the course of study.  Teachers should be guided by the content which indicates what students should know 
or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading 
(Phonemic Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar and 
Composition Writing). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds 
on the previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided 
into three categories:  basic, intermediate and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can 


21 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
access content and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to do so, in order to 
meet the needs of their students.   
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of 
opportunities should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with 
various audiences.  They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large 
group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative 
projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary 
safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with 
students.  Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  In order to avoid 
duplication in the curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best 
applied.  It is expected that once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the 
strands and that they can be assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught the Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This 
particularly refers to reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be 
highlighted.  Students are to be exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are 
taught through teacher read-alouds and independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade 
level. 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading and after reading. 
 
 
 


22 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening   
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in the area of reading still 
have opportunities to understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (through the use of pictures, video 
clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions    
as students connect skills to their everyday experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle  
the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing to see if students have mastered the skill is to have them  
incorporate it in a writing exercise.  This will give them an opportunity to apply what they have learnt.  Students who 
are able to apply reading skills, would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  Following this      
method of teaching the comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into  
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as 
ends in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and 
Handwriting; however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in 
the case of Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should 
only be scored for what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week the number of 
items on the checklist should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the 
checklist should be continually reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been 
generated.  Students should be aware of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to 
assess their own writing before it is even submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, 
mechanics and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three 
lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of 
grade two cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will 
be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas,

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
It is important to listen attentively 
when someone is speaking.  When we 
do not, we sometimes miss important 
information. 
 
A good listener: 
 
sits upright in the chair with feet firmly 
on the floor; 
 
looks at the person who is speaking; 
 
has hands that are free of pencils, 
papers, toys or similar items that can 
distract; 
 
does not speak while someone else is 
speaking; 
 
focuses on what the speaker is 
saying; 
 
formulates appropriate questions to 
ask. 
 
thinks critically about what is being 
said. 
 
responds appropriately. 
Basic:  Have students peruse 
magazines and newspapers.  
Have them create a collage of 
individuals who are exhibiting 
good listening behaviours. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
design a poster of listening 
rules with appropriate pictures 
to illustrate each one. 
 
Advanced:  Ahead of class 
record the students during a 
lesson where they had to listen 
to a presentation.  Play the 
video of the class.  Have 
students evaluate whether or 
not they were good listeners. 
 Have the class take 
turns introducing 
themselves and 
talking about their 
hobbies.  Inform the 
students that as they 
are listening to the 
presentations, they 
will be assessed as 
to how well they are 
displaying the 
characteristics of a 
good listener.  The 
teacher can use a 
checklist to assist 
with this.  
 Have students 
assess themselves 
on how well they 
listened.   
 
 magazines, 
newspapers, 
chart paper and 
video recording 
device.

Suggested Assessment 
Resources 
 
Standard English is a term applied to 
language that is grammatically 
correct with no dialect. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can 
get in the way of good 
communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class 
or with a more formal audience.   
Other occasions could be when 
conducting a class assembly, 
participating in a Christmas play etc. 
 
The Bahamian dialect can be used 
when speaking in more informal 
settings.  It has its own special 
vocabulary as well as a specific way 
of pronouncing words. 
 
It includes words like: 
gern= going 
yinna= you all 
chile= child,  
kimba=waist 
 
Dialect can be used when speaking 
informally with family, friends or 
neighbours.   
 
Basic: Read poetry or books 
containing Bahamian dialect 
like O Con Jessie by Susan J. 
Wallace.  Have students 
discuss the meaning of certain 
words or phrases.  Ask 
students to share places where 
they hear dialect and Standard 
English spoken.  Discuss the 
appropriateness of the 
situation. 
 
Intermediate:   Have students 
compile a list of places or 
occasions when dialect is 
appropriate to use and when 
Standard English should be 
used. 
 
Advanced:   Have pairs 
discuss and give the meanings 
of Bahamian sayings. E.g.  
make up ya face like a squall 
of rain (face distorted by 
frowning or pouting).   Have 
them discuss where sayings 
like this might be used. 
Provide different 
scenarios and have 
students indicate whether 
it is appropriate to speak 
in dialect or Standard 
English.

different words. 
  
A syllable can be divided into two 
parts: onsets and rimes. 
 
The onset is the initial consonant or 
consonant blend/digraph of the word 
that precedes the vowel. The rime is 
the part of the word that contains the 
vowel and the consonants that follow 
it. 
 
In the word ‘crack’, ‘cr’ is the onset 
and ‘ack’ is the rime.

Consonant letters are: b, c, d, f, g, 
h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, 
y, and z. They can be found at the 
beginning, in the middle or at the

Consonants usually represent a 
single sound consistently. However, 
some exceptions are the letters ‘g’, 
‘c’ and ‘x’ which have two sounds. 
 
The letter ‘q’ which makes the /kw/ 
sound, is almost always followed by 
‘u’ in English words.   
  
The consonants ‘w’ and ‘y’ when 
positioned at the beginning of a 
word say their consonant sounds. 
However, when they are placed in 
the middle or at the end of a word, 
they behave as vowels. 
Basic:  Have students divide a 
sheet of paper into three 
columns with the labels initial, 
middle and final. Draw or pull 
a consonant from a bag or 
box. Have students write a 
word that has that consonant 
in each position on their 
paper. 
  
Intermediate: Have students 
create Bingo cards with given 
words. Give clues that 
describe a phonic element for 
the words. Example: Find a 
word that has the /t/ sound at 
the end. Have students place 
a marker on the correct word. 
  
Advanced:  Give groups of 
students a set of alphabet 
cards. Have one member call 
a consonant and indicate if 
the sound should be at the 
beginning, middle or end. 
Then have students form a 
word with the consonant in 
the stated position. 
Have students complete 
given words in sentences 
with missing consonants.

A vowel is a speech sound which is 
produced without any closure of the 
mouth.  A vowel is an open 
phoneme (there is no obstruction by 
the tongue, lips or teeth of air flow). 
  
Short vowels have little tension in 
the vocal chords. 
  
Short vowel patterns:  
CVC: consonant – vowel – 
consonant  
The vowel is between two 
consonants.   
Examples: ‘jam’, ‘big’ and ‘cup’. 
  
VC: vowel – consonant 
When a word or syllable has only 
one vowel, the vowel can come at 
the beginning of the word. 
Examples: ‘act’ and ‘in’. 
  
CCVC: consonant blend-vowel-
consonant 
When a vowel comes between two 
consonants, it usually stands for a 
short sound.                        
Examples: ‘club’, ‘stem’, ‘black’. 
Basic: Place the pattern headings 
on the board (CVC, VC, and 
CCVC). Distribute word / picture 
cards with cvc, vc, and ccvc 
patterns to students. Have students 
read the words or give picture 
names. Ask students to sort their 
words / pictures under the correct 
heading. 
  
Intermediate:  Pair students. Give 
students a set of short vowel word 
cards (20-25) and a timer for each 
pair of students. Have students take 
turns showing each other the cards 
one at a time. Students must read 
the words on the card.  If a word is 
misread, it is placed on the table. 
As one student reads his / her 
words, the other times the reading 
for one minute.   
  
Advanced:  Use the Language 
Experience Approach to write a 
story with the students containing 
short vowel words. Underline the 
short vowel words and add them to 
the word wall. 
 
Have students 
complete sentences 
by writing missing 
words that contain 
short vowel sounds.

 Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
A vowel is an open phoneme (there 
is no obstruction by the tongue, lips 
or teeth of air flow). Long vowels are 
spoken with more tension in the 
tongue muscles.  
 
Long Vowel Patterns 
 
CVCE Pattern - CVCE stands for 
consonant – vowel – consonant – 
final e. In one syllable words 
containing two vowel letters, one of 
which is a final e, the first vowel 
usually represents a long vowel 
sound, and the ‘e’ is silent  
Examples: ‘bake’, ‘time’ and ‘hose’.  
 
CVVC Pattern -Two adjacent 
vowels- When two vowels appear 
together in a word, the first vowel 
usually gives its long sound and the 
vowel that follows is silent. 
Examples: ‘neat’, ‘goat and ‘hail’   
 
CV Pattern - Consonant – vowel 
In a one-syllable word, the vowel that 
follows the consonant is usually long.  
Examples: ‘so’, ‘he’ and ‘no’. 
 
Basic:  Provide students with 
two signs that say short and 
long.  Present a power point 
presentation of words with 
long and short vowel sounds.  
Ask students to hold up the 
sign that corresponds with 
the correct vowel sound in 
the word displayed.  
  
Intermediate:  Ask students 
to divide papers into two 
columns.  Label one column 
Long Vowel Sounds and the 
other Short Vowel Sounds.  
Allow students to listen to a 
radio ad and record words 
that they hear that belong in 
each group. 
  
Advanced:  Have students 
create tongue twisters using 
various long vowel 
phonograms. 
 
Using the cloze 
procedure, have 
students complete 
sentences by writing 
missing words that 
contain long vowel 
sounds.

Long Vowel Patterns Cont’d.  
 
Y as a vowel - The letter y can 
sometimes have a vowel sound 
instead of a consonant sound.  
In a one syllable word the letter y at 
the end of a word makes the long ī 
sound.  
Examples: ‘dry’, ‘cry’ and ‘fly’  
 
If y comes at the end of a word with 
more than one syllable, it usually has 
a long ē sound.                    
Examples: ‘penny’, ‘pony’ and ‘fairy’ 
 
Basic:  Form two teams in 
the class. Give each team a 
shaker / bell to be passed 
from player to player. Call 
words that individually begin 
with ‘y’. The first player to 
ring the bell (shaker) and 
correctly identify how the 
letter ‘y’ is used in the word 
(as a consonant or a vowel) 
gets a point for their team. 
  
Intermediate: Have students 
participate in a word hunt for 
words with ‘y’ as a vowel in a 
given passage. Have 
students record words under 
the correct headings (Long ē 
words / Long ī words. 
  
Advanced:  Have students

Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
A syllable is a word or part of a word with 
a vowel sound. The number of vowel 
sounds heard in a word determines the 
number of syllables the word will have.  
 
Syllabication Rules:  
i. When two vowels come together in a 
word and are sounded separately, divide 
the word between the two vowels.              
Example:  di-et  
 
ii. When a word ends in -le preceded by 
a consonant, divide the word before that 
consonant.                                Example:  
cir-cle  
 
iii. When a vowel is paired with the letter 
r, the two letters have one vowel sound 
which is the r-controlled vowel. Example: 
turn 
 
Iv. When a word has a suffix with a vowel 
sound in it, divide the word between the 
base word and the suffix. Example:  fly-
ing  
 
v. When a word has a prefix, divide the 
word between the prefix and the base 
word.                                             
Example:  re-new 
Basic:  Have students 
divide a page into three 
columns and label them 
1, 2 and 3. Call a word.  
Have  students write in 
Column 1, the number of 
vowels heard in the word.  
In Column 2, print the 
vowel sounds heard.  In 
Column 3, write the 
number of syllables. 
 
Intermediate: Have 
students read words in 
the context of sentences 
that follow the various 
syllabication rules.   
  
Advanced:  Dictate 
various words to students 
stressing syllables. Have 
students write words, and 
then use them in 
sentences.  
 
 
 
 
 
Have students use their 
knowledge of syllabication 
to decode unfamiliar words.

When alphabetizing words with the 
same first letter, the words should be 
organized in the correct sequence 
by using the second letters in each 
of the words.  
Example: 
Dark 
Deep 
Drizzling  
 
When alphabetizing words with the 
same first and second letters, the 
words should be organized in the

A dictionary is a book or digital 
resource that lists the words of a 
language in alphabetical order.  It 
provides their meanings and often 
states how the words are to be 
pronounced.  The words may be 
used in sentences.  Information 
about the parts of speech for the 
words is also provided.   
 
 Example from the Oxford Dictionary 
 
 pigeon  
Pronunciation:(pijon)  
Definition: a bird with fat body and  
                 flat head. 
Example Sentence: The pigeon flew 
                                 on the roof. 
Function: noun 
 
A thesaurus is a book or digital 
resource that lists words and their 
synonyms usually in alphabetical 
order. The parts of speech would 
also be provided.

Content 
Suggested  
Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
A contraction is a short way to 
write two words.  It is written 
by putting two words together 
and leaving out a letter or 
letters.  An apostrophe (‘) 
takes the place of the letter(s) 
that are left out. 
 
Examples:  
would have       
would +  have = would’ve 
 
The apostrophe shows where 
the “h” and “a” would have 
been, had the words been 
written out in full. 
 
should not 
should + not = shouldn’t 
 
The apostrophe shows where 
the “o” would have been, had 
the words been written out in 
full. 
 
Basic:  Divide index cards into an 
equal amount. On one set write 
contractions and on the other set 
write the two words that make up 
the contractions. Distribute cards to 
all of the students in the class.  At a 
signal have students find their 
partner and sit with them.  Have 
each pair share their words. 
 
Intermediate:   Have students take 
on the role of a surgeon. Dress 
them in the appropriate attire, 
including a surgical mask. Tell that 
they will perform ‘surgery’ on two 
words. Have them cut the words 
apart and sew them back together 
with paper clips. Afterwards, let 
them add a ‘bandage’ (transparent 
tape) and write in the apostrophe 
which is the ‘scar’ from the surgery. 
(Adapted from Pro Teacher 
Collection.) 
 
Advanced:  Have students rewrite 
a given passage, by replacing the 
word pairs with contraction words. 
 
 
Have students write 
contractions from word 
pairs that are called.

An abbreviation is a short 
form of writing a word. Titles 
of people, names of days of 
the week and names of 
months of the year are 
abbreviated.   
 
The abbreviated form of the 
words always ends with a 
period (.) Some abbreviations 
are: 
 
a.m. – morning 
Dr. – Doctor 
Feb. - February 
Road – Rd. 
Mon. - Monday 
Mr. – Mister 
Ms. – Misses 
p.m. - afternoon 
Rd. - Road 
St. – Street 
 
Basic:  Have students participate in an 
“Abbreviation Hunt” where they will 
search through various literary 
resources (i.e. books, magazines, 
newspapers etc.) as well as around the 
classroom and school, to find as many 
examples of abbreviations as possible.  
Have them work in groups to compile a 
booklet of abbreviations that includes 
the word and its abbreviated form.    
  
Intermediate:  Have students play a 
matching card game similar to 
“Knuckles” or “Concentration”.  The 
objective is to match the abbreviation 
with the correct word or words for 
which they stand.   
   
Advanced:   Provide clues so that 
students will know which abbreviations 
are needed to complete sentences.  
Have students write the abbreviations.

Resources 
 
A base word is the simplest form of a 
word. It is also a word to which a prefix, 
suffix or ending can be added to form a 
new word. 
Examples: ‘Print’ and ‘seen’  
  
A prefix is a syllable added to the 
beginning of a word to change the word’s 
meaning. 
‘Re’ and ‘un’ are prefixes. 
re – again 
un – not 
 
Examples:  
re (prefix) +print (base word) = reprint 
(print again) 
un (prefix) + seen (base) = unseen (not 
seen) 
  
A suffix is a syllable added to the end of 
a base word to change the word’s 
meaning. 
 
Examples: ‘safe’ and ‘play’  
‘Ly’ and ‘ful’ are suffixes. 
ly- to make 
ful – full of 
  
safe + ly (suffix) = safely (to make safe) 
play + ful (suffix) =playful (full of play} 
 
Basic:  Divide the students into 
groups to play Concentration. 
Write prefixes (or suffixes) on 
half of the cards. Write base 
words on the other half of the 
card. Have students match a 
prefix (or suffix) with an 
appropriate base word. The 
students with the most pairs 
win. 
  
Intermediate: Divide students 
into teams.  Give them five 
minutes to review a list of ten 
prefixes and their meanings.  
Display a card with a prefix on 
it.  The first team to provide its 
meaning wins a point.  The 
team with the most points once 
all of the cards have been 
revealed wins.  The same 
game can be played using the 
suffix cards.  
     
Advanced:  Have students 
match base words with a prefix 
or suffix to form a new word 
then give the meaning of the 
word formed.  
Have students label 
four columns: 
‘Prefix’, ‘Base Word’, 
‘Suffix’ and 
‘Meaning’. Using a 
word list provided, 
have students 
complete each 
column.

Objective: 2.30 Add inflectional endings (with or without) spelling changes.    
Content 
Suggested 
 Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
An inflectional ending is a letter or group 
of letters added to a base word to 
change its meaning. 
 
-ing 
The ending –ing added to a word tells 
about something that is happening now. 
  
-ed 
When –ed is added to the end of a word 
it tells of something that happened in 
the past. 
  
Whenever a short vowel word ends with 
one consonant, the last consonant is 
usually doubled before adding a suffix 
or ending that begins with a vowel 
(examples: -ed / -ing). 
 
Examples:  
shop – shopped/shopping 
stop - stopped/stopping 
 
In a one-syllable word with a long vowel 
sound and a final e, the final e is 
dropped before adding the ending –ing. 
 
Examples: 
bake – baked/baking 
shave  -  shaved/shaving 
Basic:  Have students 
write on cards base words 
to which inflectional 
endings can be added. 
Have students work in 
groups to sort the cards 
into two groups: words 
that require spelling 
changes when an 
inflectional ending is 
added and words that do 
not. Have them discuss 
reasons for their choices. 
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students participate in a 
Class Spelling Bee where 
they have to spell words 
that have inflectional 
endings added. 
 
 Advanced:  Have 
students complete a cloze 
passage that requires 
them to use words to 
which inflectional endings 
must be added. 
 
Have students write 
words that have 
inflectional endings 
added.

It is important when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at 
which you are reading, the rise and 
fall of your voice and expression. 
 
Rate – Refers to how fast or how 
slowly one speaks.  Be careful not to 
speak so slowly that listeners lose 
interest. Do not read too quickly, 
otherwise the words may not be 
clear and the listeners may find it 
difficult to follow. 
 
Intonation – The rise and fall of the 
voice to reflect what is happening in 
the reading piece. 
 
Vocal Expression – The tone of the 
reader should reflect the mood of 
the piece.  
Example 
Sad- Read slowly, lower the voice 
Angry – Loud, booming voice 
Happy – light,  
 
Pitch of Voice - Refers to the 
loudness or softness of the voice.

Story Elements 
Character: The people or animals in 
a story are the characters. When 
reading a story, you can discover 
what characters look like, what they 
think, how they feel and what they 
say and do. 
 
Stories can be told by either a 
character in the story or a witness 
who is not a character and is 
speaking about what happened. The 
point of view is about who is telling 
the story. 
  
Pronouns used by the narrator give 
clues to help the reader figure out 
‘who’ is telling the story.  
  
If the speaker is a character in the 
story,  words such as I, me, my, 
mine, we, and us are used. 
  
If the speaker is a witness to the 
story, words such as they, them, 
their, he, him, his, her, she, and it 
are used.                                        
                                                                  
Basic:  Have students 
identify character, setting 
and plot from familiar 
movies.  Discuss who is 
telling the story. 
  
Intermediate: Use a graphic 
organizer to have students 
identify the story elements in 
a familiar story.     
  
Advanced:  Read a story to 
the class.  Have students 
work in groups to complete a 
story tree. They should 
include: 
1. The name of the main  
    character. 
2. Two words that describe  
     the main character 
3. Three words to describe 
     the story setting 
4.  A sentence that tells what 
     the problem was 
5.  A sentence that tells the  
     solution 
Have students read a story 
and identify the elements 
of the story.

Resources 
 
Context Clues are the words that surround 
an unfamiliar word that give clues about its 
meaning.  Context clues may be provided in 
the following ways: 
  
1. Examples – Clues about the meanings 
of a word can be found in the examples 
that are given following the unfamiliar 
words. The word is often followed by 
like, such as, for example and 
including.   
Example:  Primates, as monkeys and 
apes, are very interesting to observe. 
2. Synonyms – Words that mean the same 
or almost the same as an unfamiliar 
word.  
Example: The schooner or sailboat 
passed the cruise ship near the island of 
Bimini. 
3. Antonyms – Sometimes a context clue 
would contrast with a new word.   
Example:  Ashley was kind to the new 
boy, not hostile. 
Basic:  Have students 
select a word.  Have them 
provide clues (synonyms 
or antonyms for the word).  
Their classmates should 
try to guess the word. 
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students read sentences 
that provide example 
clues to the meanings of 
unfamiliar words.  Have 
students explain the 
meanings of these words. 
 
Advanced:  In groups of 
four, have students write 
definitions for given 
words.  They are not to 
use dictionaries, 
glossaries, Google, Siri or 
any other search engines. 
They are only allowed to 
use each other and the 
text in which the word 
appears. They must use 
context clues. 
 
Have students 
choose the word that 
means almost the 
same as the 
underlined word in 
sentences from a 
group of words.

Classifying involves grouping 
things that are alike together.  
When things are grouped 
together it makes it easier to 
identify connections and find 
things more easily.  
 
Basic:  Have students place pictures 
of animals into various groups such 
as:  insects, mammals, reptiles etc. 
 
Intermediate:  Take students on a 
virtual tour of a zoo.  Have them use 
their knowledge of classification to 
group the animals encountered.  
Have them group the animals 
according to various characteristics.  
Have them use this knowledge to 
design the layout for their own zoo. 
See worksheet in Resources.   
 
Advanced: Provide pictures of a 
puppy and an adult dog.  Discuss 
their height and weight.  Have 
students to pretend to be visiting a 
pet shop.  Ask to help decide which 
items would be best to buy for the 
puppy and which would be best for 
the adult dog.  For example show two 
types of dog food, read the 
description of the kind of dog it is 
meant for.  Have students decide 
whether it is for the puppy or the 
adult dog.  Have them give reasons 
for their choices. 
 
Have students use a 
map of a zoo like 
Ardastra Gardens and 
Zoo and their 
knowledge of 
classification to locate 
specified animals.

When making predictions, think 
about clues the author has given 
along with what you already 
know, to make a good guess as 
to what will happen next. 
 
It will be necessary to make 
inferences and draw conclusions 
in order to make better 
predictions. 
 
Basic: Begin a simple science 
experiment.  Ask students to 
predict what they think will 
happen next.  Have students 
provide reasons for their 
predictions. Continue with the 
experiment.  Have students 
discuss whether or not their 
predictions were correct. 
 
Intermediate:  Refer students to 
previous stories of Bre Brookie 
and Bre Rabbie.  Have students 
complete an analysis of the two 
characters.  Have students use 
this information to make 
predictions about the behaviour of 
the characters as you read a new 
story together. 
 
Advanced:  As you read through 
a chapter book with students, 
have them review chapter titles 
and make predictions as to what 
they will be about.  Pause at 
various points when reading the 
story so that students can predict 
what will happen next. 
 
Read a short story to 
students.  Pause to allow 
students to record and 
check predictions as the 
story is read.

The main idea of a 
paragraph is the one idea to 
which all the other sentences 
in that paragraph are related.  
 
The sentences that tell about 
the main idea are called 
detail sentences.  Having a 
main idea helps to keep the 
paragraph organized. 
 
Basic:   Show students a painting of a 
Bahamian Scene or something 
similar.  Tell them a bit about the 
artist.  Have them give the art work a

When reading or writing paragraphs and 
stories, events must be placed in the 
correct order.  This helps the reader to 
follow the events in the story closely. In 
reading, this is referred to as the 
sequence of events. 
  
The sequence of events is also important 
when following directions to make 
something or to locate something. 
 
Clue words such as first, next, then, 
after that, and finally help readers 
understand the order in which certain 
events happened.   
  
Words such as morning, night and 
evening also tell the order in which 
events happened.   
  
Dates and time also assist with 
sequencing events. 
Basic:  Provide students with 
sentence strips that tell a 
story.  Have them arrange the 
sentences in order. Place 
numbers on the back of the 
sentence strips for self-
checking. This can also be 
done with the lines of a poem 
that has been read to them. 
 
Intermediate: After reading a 
story, have students create a

Make-believe or Fiction stories 
are created from the author’s 
imagination.  They are not true 
stories.  In many of these stories, 
animals take on the 
characteristics of humans.  The 
characters in the stories may also 
live in make-believe places.  
Some examples of fiction are 
mystery stories and fairy tales. 
   
Non-Fiction reading material 
include true facts about people, 
animals, events, things, and 
places.  Some examples of non-
fiction materials are biographies, 
autobiographies, newspaper 
articles, encyclopedias, blogs, 
information on school websites 
and text books. 
 
To figure out if a story is non-
fiction or fiction, begin by asking 
the question, “Could this happen 
in real life?”  
Basic:  Present students with 
a selection of books.  Have 
students sort them into two 
categories:  fiction and non-
fiction. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
listen to a fiction and a non-
fiction recording on the same 
topic. Have students describe 
similarities and differences 
between the two.  For 
example, one may have a 
more playful tone while the 
other is more serious or one 
has more sound effects than 
the other etc.    
  
Advanced: Have students 
work in groups to write a poem.  
Both poems would be on the 
same topic.  For example 
Frogs. Ask students to write 
both a fiction and a non-fiction 
poem on the topic.

Resources 
 
A fact is a statement that can be 
proven true or false.  This may be 
done through further reading, 
observation or by asking an expert. 
Example: 
The Princess Margaret Hospital is 
located on Shirley Street. 
  
This can be proven by looking on a 
map or by actually visiting Shirley 
Street. 
  
An opinion is a statement that tells 
what someone is thinking or how the 
person feels about a particular thing.  
Opinions can change.  Opinions 
cannot be proven true or false 
because they are based on 
someone's thoughts, their feelings 
and their understanding.  Words that 
often provide clues that an opinion is 
being expressed are think, feel, 
believe, best, worst, etc.  
Example: 
I think Princess Margaret Hospital is 
the best hospital in New Providence. 
Basic:  Have students prepare 
paddles made from index cards 
and popsicle sticks. Have 
students place (F for fact on 
one side in one colour and O 
for opinion on the other side in 
a different colour). Read 
several statements to students.  
Have students decide if each 
statement read aloud is a fact 
or an opinion by displaying the 
appropriate side of the card. 
  
Intermediate:  Display a power 
point/chart of a passage on a 
topic that is being studied.  It 
should include fact and opinion 
statements about the topic.

One thing may make another 
thing happen.  The reason why it 
happens is called the cause. The 
words “because”, “since” and 
“due to” may be used to signal a 
cause.  
 
What happens is called the 
effect. The words “therefore” 
and “as a result” may be used to 
signal an effect.    
 
A clue to finding a cause and 
effect relationship is to remember 
that the cause has to occur first 
(although it may not be the first 
thing mentioned).  The effect 
happens after.   
 
Basic:  Have students create 
posters displaying cause and effect 
situations. Have them write the 
cause and effect statement under 
the picture.  Example,  
Cause: picture of a sun 
Effect: picture of children in the  
            sea. 
Sentence: Because the sun was 
hot and humid, the children cooled 
off in the sea.” 
Intermediate:  Write Cause-and-
Effect relationship cards.  For 
example:  He doesn't get allowance 
this week (the effect) because he 
didn't do his chores (the cause). 
  
Using a cord, paper clips and a 
magnet, allow students to fish for

Good readers pay attention to whether 
the words or phrases in a text have a 
literal or a non-literal meaning.   
   
The literal meanings of words are the 
same as their definitions in a dictionary. 
The non-literal meaning of a phrase or 
words is something different altogether 
from what is being said. To tell the 
difference, ask: “Could this really 
happen, or does this make sense?”  
   
For example, take the phrase, “the Mall 
of Marathon is a zoo today”.  Is the 
author saying that animals were really 
kept in cages at the mall today? No, it 
has a non-literal meaning that the mall 
was as loud and crowded as a zoo 
would be.   
   
Similes and Metaphors are types of 
non-literal language. They both 
compare two seemingly unlike things so 
that a reader can get a better    
Picture of what is being described.   
 
Similes are phrases that begin with 
‘like’ or ‘as’.                                              
Basic:  Have students read a 
short paragraph containing 
simple metaphors and similes. 
Divide the paragraph into 
sentences and give each 
student two sentences: one 
with a figurative meaning and 
one with a literal meaning. 
Have students draw a picture 
showing what each sentence 
looks like if the meaning is 
taken literally. Using the 
drawings and the question 
“Does this make sense?”, let 
students decide if each 
sentence has a literal or a non-
literal meaning.   
   
Provide students with a 
scrambled set of figurative 
phrases and their meanings. 
Challenge students to match 
each correct meaning to its 
phrase. Incorporate the guiding 
questions for “Interpreting a 
Simile or Metaphor” to lead 
students to interpret the non-
literal sentences.  
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet where 
they must identify 
and explain 
figurative language 
in context.

Example:  “Her smile was as bright as 
the sun.” 
   
However, metaphors are phrases that 
do not use the words ‘like’ or ‘as’.  
   
Example:  “My life is a loopy 
rollercoaster ride.”  
   
When trying to interpret a simile or 
metaphor, a reader can ask:  
   
1. What two things are being 
compared?  
2. According to the author, what do   
     these two things have in common?  
3. What does the author want readers 
to think or feel about the thing being 
described?  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
read a short paragraph

Handwriting can tell a lot about a person.  
Is this person neat, organized, and 
careful?  This means that it is important 
to pay careful attention to our 
handwriting. 
 
Ensure that the letters are of the 
appropriate size and height.  Leave 
sufficient space between words. 
 
When writing sentences on lined paper, 
ensure that the margins are observed.  
There is a left red margin and a right red 
margin. 
 
Unless you are writing a paragraph, 
begin the line of writing at the left margin 
and end it at the right margin.  Use 
syllabication rules to break up a word 
that may be too long to include without 
going over the right margin. 
 
When writing a paragraph, indent the first 
line.  This means that a space about the 
size of a “thumb” is left between the left 
margin and the start of your sentence.  
The second line in the paragraph should 
begin right at the left margin.                      
Basic: Have students 
practice writing sentences 
while staying within the 
lines of the left and right 
margins.

The computer can be a useful tool when 
creating and printing reports, letters, 
invitations etc.  
 
Choosing a font that is easy to read, 
and is a reasonable size is very 
important. Font sizes between 12 and 
14 are acceptable sizes to use in 
documents such as reports.  
 
Font styles that can be used when 
creating reports or letters are: 
 Arial
 Times New Roman 
 Calibri 
 
Letters, reports and assignments should 
always be typed using a black font 
color. 
 
More creativity can be used when 
designing invitations, flyers, posters etc.  
Font sizes can be bigger and letters can 
be bolder and colourful in order to 
emphasize important information.  The 
fonts used can be more of a fun style.    
 
Party Invitations: 
 Jokerman 
 Arial Round                                     
Basic: Using a digital 
whiteboard, have 
students select fonts. 
Have them type a 
sentence using the 
chosen font.  Discuss 
legibility and whether or 
not it is appropriate for 
certain pieces of writing.   
  
Intermediate: Have 
students design an 
invitation to a party using 
different font sizes and 
styles. 
  
Advanced: Have 
students complete a 
content area report using 
the appropriate font size,

Commas are used to separate words 
in a series, when writing dates and 
also to separate who is speaking from 
what is being said.  When writing a 
comma, begin just above the bottom 
line with a dot; move up, around and 
slant down slightly below the bottom

beginning of the words that are being 
spoken and the other one at the end.   
When writing quotation marks, begin 
below the top line with a dot; up, 
around and slant down, then do the 
same again, because they’re a pair. 
They should mirror each other. 
 
Colons are used when writing time.  
It is represented by two dots.  One 
dot is placed above the other.

Resources 
 
A sentence is a group of words that 
expresses a complete idea or 
thought.    
 
Example: “They rode the bus to 
school.”  
 
Sentences should begin with a 
capital letter and end with an end 
mark. There are three different end 
marks: period (.), question mark (?) 
and exclamation point/mark (!). 
 
A fragment is a phrase or group of 
words that may be capitalized and 
punctuated like a sentence, but 
does not express a complete 
thought. 
 
Example: “The big game.” 
 
Basic:  Using flash cards, have 
students categorize groups of 
words as sentences or 
fragments.   
 
Intermediate: Have students 
work with a partner to create 
and write sentences using 
words and phrases on flash 
cards.   
 
Advanced:  Provide students 
with a short paragraph (created 
by the teacher).  Have students 
identify sentence fragments.  
Have them add details to 
convert the fragments into 
complete sentences. 
Example:  “My basketball” is 
changed to, “This is my 
basketball.” 
Using a Topic T Chart, 
have students 
categorize sentences 
and fragments in a 
table.

There are four types of 
sentences. 
Declarative sentences make a 
statement. This type of sentence 
ends with a period (.).    
Interrogative sentences ask 
questions. These types of 
sentences end with a question 
mark. (?)  Questions begin with 
special words such as: how, 
would, should, why, who, what, 
when, where, how, is, are and 
will. 
 
Exclamatory sentences express 
strong feelings such as 
excitement or anger and end with 
an exclamation mark (!).    
 
An imperative sentence makes a 
request or gives a command. It 
ends with a period (.). 
Basic:  Divide students into groups 
of five. Provide students with two 
stacks of cards.  One stack should 
contain sentences and the other 
stack should contain punctuation 
marks. Have students match 
sentence cards with their correct 
punctuation card.   
  
Intermediate:  Divide the class into 
four groups. Have students play the 
game Charades.  Have one student 
select and act out a word.  Each 
group will construct a different type 
of sentence using the word.  
Example: crying  
1. Tommy is crying. (declarative)  
2. Why are you crying? 
(interrogative)  
3. Tommy is crying his eyes out! 
(exclamatory)  
4. Stop your crying. (imperative)  
 
Advanced: Have students construct

A run-on sentence is made 
up of two or more sentences 
that have been joined 
incorrectly. They can 
sometimes go on and on.  
 
Example:  “Our beaches are 
lovely people litter them with 
food containers.”     
 
A Run-on sentence can be 
corrected by placing a comma 
and a conjunction between 
the sentences. 
 
Example:  “Our beaches are 
lovely, but people litter them 
with food containers.” 
 
Another way to correct a run-
on sentence is to separate 
them into two different 
sentences.   
 
Example:  “Our beaches are 
lovely.  People litter them with 
food containers.”   
  
 
Basic: Students will participate in 
the exercise called “Break It Up” 
where they will correct run-on 
sentences.  Give each group of 
students a set of run-on sentences 
on sentence strips.  Tell students 
when to begin, then allow them to 
cut or tear each strip at the proper 
place to form two sentences.  Once 
they are done, they must use a 
marker to put in the punctuation and 
capital letter.  
 
Intermediate:  Project a PowerPoint 
slide containing various sentences 
randomly positioned in different 
directions.  Ask students to use their 
detective skills to locate all run-on 
sentences. Ask students to rewrite 
them correctly on a sheet of paper.    
  
Advanced:  Have students complete 
a Microsoft Form where they would 
have to identify and correct run-on

Assessment 
Resources 
 
Nouns are words that name a 
person, place, animal, thing or idea. 
Nouns can be divided into common 
nouns and proper nouns.   
 
Common nouns do not name a 
particular person, place, animal, thing 
or idea. They are usually not 
capitalized unless they begin a 
sentence or are part of a title. 
 
Example:    
Person:   police 
Place:      downtown 
Animal:   dog          
Thing:     building 
Idea:       fear 
 
A proper noun names a particular 
person, place or thing and begins 
with a capital letter. Days of the week, 
months of the year and holidays are 
proper nouns. 
 
Example: 
Person:   Sgt. Rolle 
Place:      Bay Street 
Animal:   Geronimo           
Thing:     Police Station 
Basic:  Separate the class 
into two teams. Have each 
team search for nouns 
beginning with a given 
letter within a 30 second 
time frame. The first team 
with the most nouns wins. 
 
Intermediate:  Give 
students a list of nouns on 
word cards.   Have them 
work with a partner to 
classify each one under the 
correct headings of -
Person, Place, Thing, 
Animal & Idea.  Then have 
students write specific 
names for each one.    
 
Advanced:  Have students 
work in groups of four to 
identify nouns in a 
paragraph. Have them 
state if they are common or 
proper nouns.   
Have students write 
sentences about their 
community using at least 
three common and three 
proper nouns.  Have them 
circle the common nouns 
and underline the proper 
nouns.

Verbs can be used to tell when 
something happens. The action can 
happen in the present, past or the 
future.  
Present tense expresses an action 
or situation that is happening now. 
If the noun is singular (representing 
one) an “s” is added to the verb. 
Example: “Ms. Flowers drives her 
car to school.”  
When using the pronouns he, she 
and it add an “s” to the verb to 
indicate the present tense.  
Example: “It moves slowly.” 
If the noun is plural, no “s” is added 
to the verb.      
Example: “The men work on the 
building.”

A sentence has two parts: the 
subject and the predicate. 
 
The subject is the main noun or 
pronoun in the sentence. It tells 
who or what the sentence is about.  
  
Example: 
“The children study hard every 
day.” 
 
Who studies hard every day?  The 
children do. 
 
The sentence is about the children.  
 
A predicate is the verb that tells 
about the subject. It can tell what the 
subject is or what it is doing. 
 
Example:   
“The children study hard every 
day.” 
 
The children do what? They study 
hard every day. 
 
 
Basic: Present students with 
subjects and predicates. 
Have students complete 
sentences using these parts.

A sentence has two parts, the 
subject and the predicate.  
 
The subject of a sentence tells who 
or what the sentence is about.  The 
simple subject is the main word or 
noun in the complete subject. 
 
Example:  His big sister is a 
celebrity.  
 
“His big sister” is the complete 
subject. 
 
What is the key word in the 
complete subject that the sentence 
is all about?  sister.  
 
“Sister” is the simple subject. 
 
The predicate of a sentence tells 
about the subject.  The simple 
predicate is the main word or verb 
in a complete predicate.  
 
Example:  Her big sister is a 
celebrity.  “Is a celebrity” is the 
complete predicate.  What is the 
main verb in the predicate?  is  
“Is” is the simple predicate.

An adjective is a word that 
describes a noun or a pronoun.  It 
can tell “what kind”, “which one” 
or “how many”. 
 
Sensory Adjectives 
Adjectives that tell how things look, 
taste, feel, sound and smell. These 
are called sensory adjectives.  
Examples:  peppery, crunchy, 
salty, bumpy, slimy, lumpy, 
quiet, noisy, enormous, small, 
fresh, smelly etc.  
 
Adjectives that Compare: 
Adjectives can also be used to 
compare two nouns. The ending 
“er” is added to the adjective to 
show the difference.  
Example:  Peter sings louder than 
Paul. 
 
Adjectives can also be used to 
compare more than two nouns. 
The ending –est is added to the 
adjective to show the difference.  
Example:  Jack sings the loudest 
in the choir. 
Basic: Prepare a bag of popcorn. 
Share it among students. Have

 An adverb tells more about a verb, 
adjective or another adverb. 
Adverbs answer the questions how, 
when or where. Most adverbs end 
with “ly”. However, there are some 
adverbs that do not end in “ly”. 
 
Some adverbs are: 
again         little         fast 
often          where     how 
very           hard        twice 
calmly       strictly      rapidly     
suddenly   usually     swiftly 
 
 
The word too is an adverb. It is used 
to describe something that goes over 
the desired amount.  It can also mean 
“also”.   
Example:   I ate too much food. 
                  She had an apple too.  
 
Some adverbs are used to compare. 
We use “er” to compare two things 
and “est” to compare more than two 
things.   
 
fast      faster       fastest   
slow    slower      slowest 
loud     louder      loudest

sentences on the board.  
Have students make columns 
labeled “when”, “where” and 
“how”.  Ask a volunteer to 
choose an adverb and decide 
if it tells when, where or how.  
Have them write the adverbs 
in the appropriate column.  
 
Advanced:   Have students 
complete an activity sheet. 
Ask students to write the 
adverb in each sentence. 
Then write the word it 
describes.  
Example:   
 
“Officer Jones quietly sneaked 
aboard the Cuban fishing 
boat.” 
    
       quietly      sneaked

A preposition is a word that tells 
location, direction and time. It can also 
show the relationship between words in 
a sentence. 
 
Some words that tell direction and  
location are:  over, up, under, after, 
behind,  before, near, by, around, 
inside, outside, up, down, in, on, 
across, above and through 
 
Words that tell time: 
until, during and often  
 
Words that show relationship: 
at, by, to, for, of, off and with  
 
A prepositional phrase is made up of a 
preposition, the object of the preposition 
and any word in between. 
 
Example:  across the park 
“Across” is the preposition and “park” is 
the object of the preposition. 
 
Prepositional phrases help to make our 
writing more interesting as they help to 
give more details.  
Example: “John ran quickly.” 
“John ran quickly across the park and 
jumped over the fence.”

A paragraph is a group of 
sentences about the same 
idea. The main idea of a 
paragraph is what the 
paragraph is about.  The main 
idea is often relayed in the 
topic sentence which is 
usually the first sentence in 
the paragraph and is 
indented.  
 
Other sentences tell more 
about the main idea and are 
called supporting details.  
The last sentence in a 
paragraph should tie the 
supporting sentences 
together. It is called the 
concluding sentence.  
 
When writing a composition or 
an essay, you may have at 
least three paragraphs.  Each 
paragraph should speak 
about the one main idea and 
include supporting details. 
 
Basic:   Present students with a 
paragraph. Have students circle the 
topic sentence and underline at least 
three supporting details.

How a piece of writing is started is very 
important.  It is here where many 
readers decide whether to continue 
reading or to stop.  The type of writing 
and the topic should be considered 
when writing an introduction.  Ensure 
that a topic sentence is provided. 
 
 Begin with a question.  What 
would you have done if someone

The conclusion of a writing piece 
brings everything smoothly to an 
end.  A good writer does not have to 
“announce” that it is “the end”. There 
are several ways to conclude a 
piece of writing. 
 
 State the lesson learned or 
moral of the story. 
 End with a surprise. 
 End with a quote. 
 Repeat the main idea of the 
passage. 
 Summarize the main points.  
Do not introduce new ideas. 
 Provide your opinion. 
 Give advice.

to the reading of three to 
four stories. Have them state 
the type of conclusion used 
and the concluding 
statement in each story.

students with samples of 
various endings to different 
expository pieces.  Have 
them discuss what they liked 
about them.  Have them

Resources 
 
Everyone has a different style of 
writing.  Voice refers to how much 
of the writer can be felt in a piece.  
Does the writer believe what is 
being written?  Is the writer really 
interested in what is being written? 
Can you get a feel for the writer’s 
personality? 
 
The writer’s voice comes through 
in the tone and mood of a piece.  
Tone refers to the feeling that an 
author creates.  Is the piece 
serious? playful? angry? etc.  
 
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the piece.  
Is the reader happy? sad? fearful?  
It is important that the tone 
matches the messages that the 
writer is trying to send.  If the 
subject is serious for example, the 
language should not be light or 
funny. 
 
Basic: Read snippets of 
different students’ writing in 
the class.  Using the voice of 
the piece, have students try to 
match the writing pieces with 
the classmates that wrote 
them. 
 
Intermediate:   Have 
students view television 
commercials.  Have them 
discuss the varying moods 
and their effectiveness. 
   
Advanced:  Distribute flash 
cards with “mood voices”. 
Have students with the card 
come to the front of the class 
one at a time and talk in that 
voice for 20 seconds. When 
the time is up, ask students 
what kind of voice was used. 
Have students select a mood 
and write a piece portraying 
that mood. 
 
 
 
Present students with 
emotion cards/emojis or 
pictures. Have them write 
a paragraph using 
language to depict the 
selected mood and tone. 
Have them use ‘the

When writing, choose a viewpoint 
from which to write and stick with it. 
 
First Person – When telling your 
personal story use pronouns like I, 
me, my, mine, myself and we. 
Connect with the readers by telling 
them your personal thoughts and 
experiences.  You are telling the 
story only from your perspective. 
 
Second Person – When writing 
from the perspective of someone 
who is watching what is happening, 
use pronouns like you and yours. 
 
Third Person – From this viewpoint 
you are the person who is looking 
on.  Use pronouns like he, she, it 
and they.  From this perspective you 
get to experience the thoughts of the 
characters. 
 
Personification - This is when an 
animal or object behaves like a 
human.  They may speak or move, 
share emotions etc. 
Basic:  Divide the class into 
two groups.  Show one group a 
picture of the Glass Window 
Bridge from the ground level.  
Show the other group a view of 
it from above.  Explain to them 
that the pictures were of the 
bridge in Eleuthera.  Ask both 
groups to describe what they 
saw.  Discuss why their 
responses were different.  
Compare this to differing points 
of view in writing.

Poems may rhyme or not rhyme.  
Rhymes usually occur at the end of 
lines.  
 
Rhythm is the beat or series of 
stressed or unstressed syllable (word 
part) in a poem. Poems have specific 
rhyme schemes. A rhyme scheme is 
noted by the letters of the alphabet, 
beginning with the letter ‘a’. The word 
at the end of the first line will be noted 
as ‘a’. Every line after that, that ends 
with the same rhyming sound will be 
noted as ‘a’. The next line having a 
different rhyming sound at the end 
that is different from ‘a’, will then be 
noted as ‘b’ and so on.  
 
Limerick 
The limerick is a very funny poem 
that follows the rhyme pattern of 
aabba (as explained above). 
 
Cinquain 
This is a poem with five lines.  There 
are several different forms.  They can 
be rhymed or unrhymed.  They often 
describe a person, place or thing.  
 
Basic: Take students on a 
rhyme hunt. Give each group an 
object (coconut, shell, cent, fish, 
beach sand, etc). Tape rhyming 
words to chalkboard. Allow 
different members of each team 
to select the words that rhyme 
with their objects. At the end of 
three minutes allow groups to 
organize and share their 
rhyming words.  Have students 
use the rhyming words to create 
a limerick. 
  
Intermediate: Provide students 
with a poem. Discuss the 
organization of the rhyme 
scheme in the poem (a, a; b, b; 
c, c). Give students two rhymes 
and let them identify the rhyme 
scheme.  
  
Advanced: Present and discuss 
the structure of different kinds of 
poems. Have students write 
selected types of poems on a 
culturally relevant topic. 
Have students write 
poems about their 
families, teacher, or 
pet, using a format of 
their choice (cinquain,

Assessment 
Resources 
 
In order to provide more vivid details, 
authors often include dialogue in their 
writing.  A dialogue is a conversation 
between two or more people. 
 
In a movie the camera may switch from 
character to character so that the audience 
can see who is speaking.  When writing, 
there is a special way of identifying who is 
speaking and the words that are being 
spoken. 
 
Commas are used to separate who is 
speaking from what is being said.   
 
Quotation marks are used to indicate the 
exact words that are being spoken.  One is 
placed at the beginning of the words that 
are being spoken and the other one at the 
end.  They usually follow a comma unless 
they begin the sentence.  The first word in 
a quote should be capitalized. 
 
Example:  Keith said, “Wipe your mouth.” 
                “Wipe your mouth,” Keith said. 
 
Avoid overusing “said” in your writing.  
Include words that help to express the 
mood more clearly such as screamed, 
whispered, exclaimed, laughed etc. 
Basic:   Write a sentence on a 
sentence strip that contains 
dialogue.  Separate each word.  
Make a cut-out of a comma and 
beginning and ending quotation 
marks.  Give each student a 
word from the sentence and have 
them stand in front of the class.  
Have students first put the 
sentence in an order that makes 
sense. Then have the students 
with the punctuation marks insert 
them where they should go. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with a scenario and have them 
write two sentences of a fitting 
dialogue.  
 
Advanced:  Have students 
watch a clip from a favourite 
show.  Turn on the closed 
caption and freeze the frames in 
succession.  Have students 
identify different lines that the 
characters said.  In small groups 
have students work together to 
write the dialogue. 
Have students 
listen to a 
conversation 
between two 
friends.  Ask 
them to compose 
their own version 
of the 
conversation 
being sure to 
report on who 
said what.

Narrative writing tells a story or part 
of a story.  A narrative should have a 
beginning, middle and end and 
should include characters, setting 
and a well-developed plot. 
 
Characters are animals or people in 
a story.   
 
The setting is the place where the 
story takes place.  Time should be 
taken to use the senses to tell what 
can be seen, heard, felt, tasted or 
smelled.   
 
In the middle of the writing, time 
should be taken to develop the plot.  
The plot tells what the problem in 
the story is and how it is resolved.  
This is the time to use action and 
dialogue to provide information 
about the characters. 
 
The end of the story or conclusion 
wraps everything up. 
 
Basic:  Have students spend 
time developing the 
characters in their stories. 
Have them create a Wanted 
Poster for their characters that 
would give details on their hair 
colour, eye colour, height, 
skin complexion etc.  Adjust it 
to include information on their 
personalities as well.  Have 
students incorporate these 
traits in their stories.   
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
create a diorama/picture of 
the setting.  Have them use 
this to describe the setting of 
the stories in their writing. 
 
Advanced: Have students 
use a graphic organizer to 
help them develop a plot for 
their story.  Have them 
incorporate this into a story 
along with all of their 
descriptions of the characters 
and settings. 
 
 
Have students complete 
a narrative piece.  
Assess the extent to 
which students: 
1. Developed a 
central idea. 
. 
2. Used sequence or 
other logical order 
to develop the 
story plot. 
  
3. Added interest to

A descriptive essay is a group of 
paragraphs that can describe a 
particular person, place or an event.  
The details are presented in such a 
way that it makes it easy for the 
reader to visualize what the writer is 
describing.  Authors use sensory 
words, similes and metaphors to 
make their writing come alive. 
 
Sensory words are focused on the 
senses:  smell, taste, see, touch 
and hear. 
 
Similes are phrases that begin with 
like or as and are used to compare 
two unlike things. 
 
Example:  “Her dress was as 
colourful as a rainbow.” 
 
Metaphors are also used to 
compare. They do not use like or 
as. 
 
Example:  “The clouds were huge 
cotton balls in the sky.”

The body of the letter – This is considered 
the main part of the letter where you may 
include all of the interesting details about your 
family and friends and what you have been 
doing, your hobbies etc.   
 
 The Closing – This is a way of ending the 
letter or signing off.  “Love” and “Your best 
friend” are examples that are used.  The first 
word in the closing is always capitalized. This 
is normally written on the right hand side of the 
letter a few spaces under the body of the letter. 
 
Signature – This identifies by name the 
person who is writing the letter. 
 
 
Basic:  Provide students

The Reading Block 
 
 
 
The Reading Block for lower primary refers to the 90-minute double period dedicated exclusively for the teaching of reading from 
9:10 a.m. – 10:40 a.m. each morning.  This daily instructional block encourages the integration of the five components of reading 
(phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension).  Within this block, time should be allocated for guided 
reading where teachers hear students read in small groups as well as individually.   
 
Useful Information about the Teaching of Reading 
 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate. 
 
 
 
Basal Readers 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-leveled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach (reading 
for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate reading 
material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension skills and 
vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 


189 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
  
The Language Experience Approach 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This approach 
can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an experience for 
students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the board or on chart 
paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the language arts components 
(speaking, listening, writing and reading) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading refers to teachers working with students in small groups to provide support in reading and comprehending 
designated texts.     
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teachers’ observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read orally. 
The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps the 
teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 


190 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings in relation to the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, science 
and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, the more demand for reading 
skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  Lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ ability and interests and be ready to help students find the right books at the right 
time.  Learning Students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can be 
found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage students to 
visit their school libraries.

Important Phonics Rules 
  
 
1. C has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /k/ or /s/.  It is pronounced /k/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in words like 
‘can’, ‘cough’ and ‘cut’.  C makes its soft sound /s/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘cent’, ‘city’ and 
‘cycle’. 
 
2. G has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /g/ or /j/.  It makes its hard sound /g/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in 
words like ‘gate’, ‘goat’ or ‘got’.  G makes its soft sound /j/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘gem’, ‘gills’ or 
‘gym’.  There are some exceptions to this rule as in words like ‘get’, ‘give’ and ‘gift’. 
 
3. The CVC pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel and then another consonant.  When this 
happens, the vowel usually gives its shorts sound.  Examples are words like ‘bed’, ‘man’ and ‘hat’.  
 
4. The Final E or CVCE pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel, another consonant and a final 
e.  In instances where this occurs, the first vowel gives its long sound (says its name) and the e is silent.  Examples of 
words that follow this pattern are ‘made’, ‘home’, ‘cute’ and ‘date’. 
 
5. The CV pattern refers to words that only have one-syllable.  In these two-letter words, the vowel normally gives its long 
sound as in words like ‘go’ and ‘me’.  Some one-syllable words do not follow this pattern as in words like ‘to’ and ‘do’. 
 
6. R-Controlled vowels refer to vowels that are followed by the letter r.  When this happens, the sound of the r usually 
dominates the vowel sound, and the sound that the vowel makes is neither a short or a long sound.  Words like ‘cart’, ‘far’ 
and ‘for’ are examples of the r-controlled sounds. 
 
7. When gh follows i, the i gives its long sound and the gh is silent.  ‘High’ and ‘night’ are examples of this rule. 
 
8. In words that begin with kn and wr, only the sound for the second letter is heard.  In the words ‘knot’ and ‘wreck’ the n 
and r sounds are heard.

193 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
Vowel Generalizations 
 
The following are some of the most common vowel generalizations. 
 
a. In one syllable words containing two vowel letters (one of which is a final e) the first vowel usually represents a long vowel 
sound, the e is silent. (e.g. kite, bite). 
b. In a one-syllable word that ends with a vowel, the vowel that follows the consonant is usually long (e.g. he, go – open 
syllable). 
c. A vowel is usually short when it appears between two consonants in a one-syllable word (e.g. hat, fox, dig – closed 
syllable). 
d. When i is followed by gh, nd,  or ld, the i usually represents its long sound (e.g. find, child, light). 
e. The vowel o followed by –ld usually has a long sound (e.g. old).  
f. If the only vowel in a word or syllable is an a followed by w, ll and u, the sound of the a is usually that of a short o (e.g. 
wall).  
g. When two vowels appear together in a word, the first vowel usually gives its long sound and the vowel that follows is silent. 
This rule is usually consistent with ai, oa, ee and ay combinations. 
h. Each vowel letter may represent the soft schwa sound often heard in the unaccented syllable (e.g. disappear, telegram). 
i. Y functions as a vowel when it concludes words of more than one syllable (e.g. dad/dy) and it follows a vowel (e.g. day).

Writing Instruction 
 
Daily Written Composition 
The timetable for the Lower Primary Grades provides daily periods for Written Composition instruction with a total of five (5) periods 
weekly.  In some instances, a daily allotment of 30 minutes for written composition may not be feasible; hence, the time allotment for 
instruction is five periods per week.  It is recommended based on research and best practices that composition writing should follow 
a balanced literacy approach.    
 
Instructional Strategy: 10 Day Writing Plan   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
“A Ten Day Writing Plan” is a pilot writing model developed to support the daily teaching of written composition. This plan can be 
adapted for use at all primary grades This Plan is research based and contains the following components of good writing instruction: 
· Mentor Texts 
· Providing Enriching Experiences to Build Background Knowledge 
· Vocabulary Building Activities 
· The Writing Process 
· Writing Instructional Strategies 
- Modeled Writing 
- Interactive Writing

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 –  2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

PROFILE OF THE IDEAL GRADUATE 


x 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
  
 
 
Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 


xi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection. 
 
MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS GRADES 1 – 12 
A DISCUSSION 


xii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example, Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics.

Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three.

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
                                                                                                                       
 
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


xvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at  
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended. 
 
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE 


xxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.  
 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 


xxii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested. 
BEST PRACTICES IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS 


xxv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1 - 6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students. 
 
 Teach to the needs of each group of students during guided mathematics activities. 
 
 Integrate mathematics across the curriculum. 
 
 Give tests at the end of a concept or unit.  This will identify students learning and the effectiveness of teacher strategies/practices. 
 
 Give post-test at the end of the school year to determine students’ successes.  
 
 Record results from the assessments in teachers’ Mark Book, portfolios, and formal reports. 
 
 Host Mathematics competitions to give students the opportunity to compete with their peers and solidify skills and concepts taught. 
 
 Teacher training/upgrading in mathematics instruction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 


xxvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 
Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES 


xxvii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
 
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of comprehension than those under Understand. 
 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 
Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
 putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
 production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three distracters.  
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, 
or a multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical thinking 
skills.  Furthermore, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in working with 
timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various components of the 
examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques and timed tests/ 
quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently write National 
Examinations.

In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                 
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful by relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life; 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


xxx 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
1. Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The  next day, 
discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
2. Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
3. Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
4. Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
5. Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
6. Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the most points?) 
and 
 
7. Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY (POD) 


xxxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can: 
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do.  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed.  
 
delete extraneous information.  
 
identify the parts in the question.  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best.  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved.  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information.  
 
share student-generated questions.  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers.   
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
*NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

1.  Use ordinal numbers to 
identify positions from first 
to fiftieth. 
 Ordinal numbers tell the position of an object or a 
person.

                 21st             twenty first 
 The ordinal numbers from 5th to 20th end with th. 
 
 The following pattern then continues throughout 
each number family (grouped by tens). 
 
Pattern: 
First – st (e.g. 21st, 31st, 41st) 
Second – nd (e.g. 22nd, 32nd) 
Third – rd (e.g. 23rd, 33rd) 
Fourth through tenth – th (e.g. 24th, 35th, 46th) 
 
 Have students form a line 
according to height (i.e. tallest or 
shortest).  Then have students 
count their place on the line (i.e. 
1st, 32nd, 3rd, 4th, …) 
 Ask the following questions 
 Who is first on the line? 
 Who is third, tenth…? 
 What place is Lisa? 
 Put students in groups. Have each 
group run a race on the playing 
field. Choose some students 
observing the race to pin ribbons 
on the competing students 
according to the order in which 
they finished the race.

seconds each (Continued). 
Addition and Subtraction facts involve the 
addition and subtraction of two single-digit 
numbers up to 9 + 9 and 9 – 9. 
 
Examples: 7 + 9 = 16               8 – 4 = 4 
 
Addition facts up to 9 + 9.  
Subtraction facts up to 9 - 9. 
 
 Addends are the numbers that are combined or 
added together. 
 
 Sum is the answer to an addition problem.  
Students are to learn all the addition facts 
through 20 and be able to recall them within a 
period of 3 seconds each. 
 
Helpful Study Hints 
 Commutative property of addition 
Example:  7 + 2 = 2 + 7 
 
 Identity Property of Zero 
Example:  7 + 0 = 0 + 7 
 
 Identity Property of Addition: Any number 
plus 0 equals that number. Example: 3 + 0 = 3 
Beat the Clock 
  Addition and subtraction facts 
through 20. 
 
 Students are timed as they complete 
the worksheet to recall addition and 
subtraction facts. The student with 
the least time and the most correct is 
it the winner. 
    (Aim: to complete each fact within 
the 3 second timeframe). 
 
 
Drill: Use flash cards and allow 
students to identify addition and 
subtraction facts in less than 3 
seconds. This indicates mastery of 
the fact. 
 
 Dominoes: Students will turn over 
dominoes (one at a time) and add 
the sets shown on each domino. 
Students can also subtract the 
smaller set from the larger set on 
each domino and provide the 
difference.

6. Recall addition and 
subtraction facts through 
20 within a time frame of 3 
seconds each. 
 Adding 1: Adding one to a number is the next 
number in the sequence. 
Example: 3 + 1 = 4 
 Subtraction Property of Zero: When subtracting 
0 from any number, the number stays the same.  
Example: 5 – 0 = 5 
 
When subtracting a number from itself, the 
difference is 0. Example: 8 – 8 = 0 
 
Combine two sets of objects and 
write the number sentence.

7.  Round numbers to the 
nearest ten and hundred. 
  Rules for rounding to the nearest ten 
a. The digit in the ones place helps you to find 
the closest ten. If the digit in the ones places 
is 5 or more you round up. If the digit in the 
ones place is less than 5, the digit in the tens 
place remains the same.  
 Example: Round 43 and 47. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
43 is closer to 40 and 3 is less than 5. Therefore, 43 
rounds to 40. 
 
So, 47 is closer to 50 and 7 is greater than 5. So. 47 
rounds to 50. 
 
 A plane is flying from Andros to 
Nassau. The total distance is 100 miles. 
After the plane flies 60 miles, one 
engine develops trouble. The pilot must 
decide whether to fly back to Andros or 
fly on to Nassau.  What should the pilot 
do? Why? (fly to Nassau, the plane is 
closer to Nassau). 
 Accept all reasonable answers and 
consider other issues that students may 
wish to raise. Discuss similar situations. 
Encourage students to share their 
thinking. 
 
Treasure Diving 
 Rounding Three-Digit Numbers to the 
Nearest 10, players will embark on a 
race to get over the hill and retrieve a 
treasure. In order to get over the hill, 
they will need to round the given 
numbers by selecting the correct speed 
amp. If they select the wrong amp, the 
car will roll down the hill. If they select 
the correct speed amp, the car will go 
over the hill.

7.  Round numbers to the 
nearest ten and hundred. 
Rules for rounding hundreds 
 a. Use the digit in the tens place to help you round.  
 b. If the digit in the tens place is 5 or more round 
up. If the digit in the tens place is less than 5, 
the digit in the hundreds place remains the 
same. Example: Round 334 and 386 to the 
nearest hundred. 
                  334                 386 
 
 
300              350         400 
 
334 is closer to 300 and 34 is less than 50. Therefore, 
334 rounds to 300. 386 is closer to 400 and the 86 is 
more than 50 so 386 rounds to 400. 
Take a Shot 
 Teacher will create a set of 
number cards to be rounded. 
Students will come up one at a 
time to select a number. The 
teacher will write the benchmarks 
for the selected number above the 
baskets. Then, the students will 
shoot the ball into the correct 
basket after rounding.

8. Estimate sums and 
differences. 
 Remember estimate means to find the approximate 
value. 
 There are many estimation strategies. Rounding is a 
strategy that is useful for addition and subtraction. 
 
 To round numbers, determine the digit to be 
rounded. Look at the digit to its right. If it is 0-4, 
the digit in the rounding place stays the same. If it 
is 5 or more, the digit in the rounding place 
increases by 1. 
 
E.g. 
     88  →     90          =      615   →  600 
  + 91  → + 90                  167   →  200

 Have students write about a 
situation in their own lives when 
it is better to estimate than to find 
an exact answer. 
 
(Students might suggest 
estimating the amount of school 
supplies, such as paper and 
pencils that they will need for the 
school year.) 
 
On a Budget 
 Have a store set up in the 
classroom. Items are to be 
priced at whole number values. 
Students are given a certain 
amount of money and are told to 
collect as many items that they 
can get without going over their 
budget. Students are given 2 
minutes to do this.

 Adding and subtracting money amounts is 
similar to adding and subtracting whole 
numbers.  You add to find the total price of 
more than one item. You subtract to find the 
change you will receive. 
 
 When you add and subtract money, put the 
decimal point and the dollar signs in the 
correct places. 
    ( Example:  $2.35) 
 Have students write word problems 
with money amounts.

13.  Calculate and convert 
combinations of Roman 
numbers to standard 
numerals and vice versa.  
  Roman numerals are based on addition and 
subtraction. 
Example: VI = 5+1 = 6. 
When the symbol for the smaller number is 
written to the right of the greater number, 
add.  No more than three symbols for smaller 
numbers are used this way.   
IV = 5 – 1 = 4 
When the symbol for a smaller number is to 
the left of the greater number, subtract. No 
more than one symbol for a smaller number 
is used this way.   
Examples: XX= 20; VII = 7 
Game: Mixed and Match 
a. Students form a circle and are given 
flash cards with either the Roman 
numeral or the standard number 
counterpart. 
 
b. The teacher says the word mix and 
then match 
 
c. Students find the persons with the 
Roman numeral counterpart and then 
share their findings with the class.

17. Explain multiplication as 
repeated addition. 
 Multiplication is the process of repeatedly adding the 
same number. This is also known as repeated 
addition. 
 
 Multiplying is a way to find how many in all when 
groups have the same number of items. 
 
  Example:  2 + 2 + 2  = 6 
                3 x 2 = 6 (answer)

19. Identify and use 
multiplication and 
division facts through 12 
x 12. 
 Teacher connects fact families and commutative 
property to multiplication and division facts. 
 
 The NINE multiplication facts is the one less = 
nine method. Subtract one from the number you are 
multiplying by. Example 9 x 5 (One less than 5 is 
4). The first number in the answer is 4.  The two 
numbers that make up the answer will equal 9. 
So 4 + __ = 9 (5). The last number in the answer is 
5. 9 x 5 = 45. One less than 5 is 4 (45)  
The answer adds up to nine. 4 + 5 = 9  
 Put students in groups and assign 
each group a multiplication table. 
Let the group work together to 
create a poster that illustrates a 
viable strategy that can be applied

between the three numbers involved. 
 
 In a multiplication and division fact family, there 
are four multiplication and division sentences 
created using three numbers.  
 
Example: Write a fact family using 4, 3, and 12 
4 x 3 = 12       12 ÷ 3 = 4

b. Explain the role of 
the numerator and

 The concept of a fraction as a part-whole 
relationship is where one or more equal parts of a 
whole are compared with the total number of these 
parts that it takes to make up the whole.  
 
 
 To understand fractions as part-whole relationships, 
students need to recognise the relationship between 
the denominator (total number of equal-sized parts 
that make up the whole) and the numerator 
(number of these parts of interest).   
 
Example: 2/5 of the marbles are shaded 
   
 
 
       Read: Two fifths 
       Write: 2/5 
 
 The marbles belong in a group. The number tells 
how many parts are being counted. 
 
 The denominator tells how many equal parts are in 
the whole or group. It is the bottom number of a 
fraction.

31. Compare and order 
fractions with different 
denominators. 
  Example: compare ⅓ and ¼  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The bar for ¼ is shorter than the bar for ⅓.  So, 
¼ < ⅓  or ⅓ > ¼ 
 
 You can order three or more fractions from 
least to greatest or from greatest to least. 
 
Example: Order the fraction from least to  
greatest.  1/10, ½, 2/6 
 
 Step 1 
 
    Compare the fractions 1/10 and ½  
 
                                         1/10 < ½ 
 
                                           ½ > 2/6 
 
Therefore: 1/10, 2/6, ½  
Order the fraction from least to greatest 1/10,

32. Find equivalent fractions. 
 Equivalent fractions are fractions that represent 
the same portion of a whole or group.  
 
 When finding equivalent fractions multiply or 
divide the numerator and the denominator by the 
same number (greater than one). 
 Review: Numbers that are multiplied by one, equal 
the same number. 
Example of one as a fraction. 
         3/3, 4/4, 2/2 
 Multiply the numerator and denominator by the 
same number to find the equivalent fraction or 
divide the numerator and the denominator by the 
same number. 
Example:  3/12 x 4/4 = 12/48 
        3/12  ÷  3/3 = ¼ 
These are equivalent because they represent the same 
amount (¼). 
 Interactive game where students 
match equivalent fractions.

34. Find the simplest form of 
a fraction. 
 A fraction is in its simplest form when the 
greatest common factor of its numerator and 
denominator is one. 
 
 To simplify fractions, find a common factor that 
will divide evenly into the numerator and 
denominator.   
For example: 6/9   
 
 Find the factors of the numerator and denominator. 
     Factors of 6 = 1, 2 ,3 
     Factors of 9 = 1, 3 
* The common factor is 3 
 
 To simplify the fraction, divide by 3. 
     6/9  ÷ 3/3 = 2/3 
 Give groups problems involving 
different operations of fractions 
where students have to reduce 
fractions.

37. Multiply and divide tens, 
hundreds, and thousands 
by a 1-digit number. 
 
When multiplying by ten, move all the digits one 
place to the left and put a zero in the space. This 
means the ones become tens, tens become 
hundreds, and hundreds become thousands. 
     
 
When we multiply by 100, move all the digits two 
places to the left. The empty columns in the ones 
and tens places are filled by 0. 
 
 When you divide a decimal number by 10, you 
move all the digits one place to the right.  The

 
A pattern is a strategy that can be used to 
solve problems. 
 
 
You can use the order of shapes in a design 
to identify a pattern to solve a problem. To 
find patterns you can use the following 
steps. 
 
Step 1- Understand  
- What are you asked to find? 
- What information will you use? 
 
Step 2 
- What strategy can you use to solve the 
problem? 
 
Step 3 
     - How can you use the strategy to       
       solve the problem? 
 
Step 4 
   - How can you decide if your answer  
     is right? 
 Have students work in small groups to 
find examples of patterns in the 
classroom. Suggest that they look for 
patterns in books, magazines, on 
clothing or on object such as pencil, 
vases, or artwork that is displayed in 
the room.

 An equation is a number sentence that says two 
expressions are equal. 
e.g. 5 + 3 = 10 – 2 
             8 =   8 
 Two sides of a number sentence can be equal or 
unequal.  A symbol >, <, or = tells how the sides 
compare.   
 
Example: 3 + 4       
2 + 7     
 
                          7        <         9       
 
 The symbol = means “is equal to”. In a number 
sentence, the symbol = tells that the value on the 
left is equal to the value on the right. 
 
Example  a) 9 +________   = 11 
 
                      b) 10 = 3 + ________

VOCABULARY 
 
Minute- a unit of time equal to 60 seconds.  
 
Minute hand – the longest hand on an analog 
clock; it designates minutes. 
 
Hour- a unit of time equal to 60 minutes 
 
Half hour- a unit of time equal to 30 minutes. 
 In cooperative groups, students 
create and report scenarios of 
a.m. and p.m. activities. 
 
 Play the game ‘Time for 
Bingo’. Download the bingo 
game board, instructions and 
materials for telling time to the 
nearest five minutes from.  
 superteacherworksheets.com/ti

be. 8.30 a.m. or 8.30 p.m.? 
 Would you be more likely to 
eat lunch at 12.20 am or 12.30 
p.m.? 
 2. Identify events taking 
the same amount of 
time, more time than, or 
less time than. 
 We tell time in minutes, hours, days, weeks, 
months, and years.  
 Some events take the same amount of time, more 
time than, and less time than.  
 
 Model time relationships.  
 Create a list of events taking the 
same amount of time, more time 
than or less time than other 
events. Have students draw 
three columns. Label each the

3. Apply vocabulary 
associated with time using 
a.m., p.m., noon, or 
midnight. 
 A. M. and P. M. start immediately after midday. 
Midnight and Noon (Midday) respectively. 
 Use 12 noon and 12 midnight for clarity.  Do not 
use the terms 12.00 a.m. and 12.00 p.m. It is 
incorrect.  
 Noon is neither before or after noon; it is simply 
noon. Therefore, neither the "a.m." nor the “p.m." 
designation is correct. On the other hand, midnight 
is both 12 hours before noon and 12 hours after 
noon. Therefore, either 12 a.m. or 12 p.m. could 
work as a designation for midnight, but both would 
be ambiguous as to the date intended. 
 Every day starts precisely at midnight and a.m. start 
immediately after that point in time. 
 To avoid ambiguity, airlines, railroads, and 
insurance companies use 12.01 a.m. for an event 
beginning the day and 11.59 p.m. for ending it. 
 The hours of the day between midnight and noon 
are a.m. hours. 
 In groups, draw and write events 
that occur at specific times. For 
example, breakfast, lunch, and the 
like. 
 
Solve Riddles 
 Have students solve the riddles 
and write the given times.

MULTIPLY.   
                                             
     Examples: Metric Units 
 7cm = 70 mm 
       7 x 10 = 70 
  Multiply by 10 because 1cm = 10 mm 
 
      4m = 400 cm 
          4 x 100 = 400 
Multiply by 100 because 1m = 100 cm

17. Make change for 
purchases $20.00 or less. 
 Change is the difference between the price of an 
item and the amount you give the clerk. The clerk 
will give back change. Example: if an item cost 
$0.47 and you give the clerk $0.50, you will 
receive $0.03 change. 
 
 Counting on is one way to make sure you get the 
correct amount of change when you buy 
something.  
 
 Subtraction is another way to ensure you get the 
correct change. 
 Divide the class into 4 or 5 
groups. Allow each group to sell 
different items (e.g. one group 
sells toys, one group food, one 
group DVD’s or CD’s; one group 
games etc.). Base items on 
students’ interest.  
 Allow students at different times 
to go to each group and make a 
purchase. Make sure items do not 
cost more than $5.00. This activity 
can be extended where students 
set up booths and have other 
students from other classes or 
grades come to make purchases.

18. Round the purchase 
amount for items in a 
penny exempt trading 
system (to be referred to as 
“Rounding for Cash 
Exchange”). 
 Rounding takes place on the total bill of purchase 
and not on individual prices.  
 
 Rounding for Exchange Rules:  
When a total bill is paid; the amount of change to 
be paid will be rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 
cents:  
 
c. Amounts ending in $0.01 or $0.02 will be 
rounded down to $0.00 (Example:  $4.21 
becomes $4.20).  
 
d. Amounts ending in $0.03 or $0.04 will be 
rounded down to $0.05 (Example: $7.23 
becomes $7.25).  
 
c. Amounts ending in $0.06 or $0.07 will be 
rounded down to $0.05 (Example: $15.67 
becomes $15.65).  
 
d. Amounts ending in $0.08 or $0.09 will be 
rounded down to $0.10 (Example: $27.89

3.  Identify and draw lines of 
symmetry on plane shapes. 
  A line of symmetry is an imaginary line which divides a 
figure into equal parts.  Lines of symmetry can be drawn 
from eft to right or top to bottom on a shape. 
 
 If you fold a figure along a line of symmetry, both sides 
should be the same. Some shapes have one line of 
symmetry. Some shapes have more than one.  
 
 Shapes that can be divided into equal parts are 
symmetrical. Shapes that cannot be divided into equal 
parts are asymmetrical. 
 
Examples:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Student folds a sheet of 
paper in half and make a 
simple drawing on only one 
side of the fold. Partners 
exchange papers and try to

PRIMARY SCIENCE MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Primary Science Unit recognizes the place of science in everyday human affairs and aim for scientific literacy that is operational in understanding 
oneself. We seek to provide a level of understanding and scientific literacy that will prepare students to be informed and participative citizens who are able to 
make judgments and decisions regarding science applications that may have social, health or environmental impacts. 
 
 
 
BROAD OBJECTIVES 
 
The team responsible for effecting the necessary revisions to the Primary Science Curriculum holds the view that the curriculum should achieve two 
broad objectives: 
 Provide courses of study that challenge participants to acquire scientific skills and academic standards consistent with emerging global 
workforce requisites while simultaneously promoting self-confidence, character strengthening, creativity and personal initiative. 
 Improve the use of technology in the teaching/learning process. 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 
 
To provide opportunities that expose and engage students in The Bahamas in acquiring scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes which will enhance 
critical thinking, problem-solving and organizational skills. In so doing, students will be able to participate in varied scientific and technological 
careers in the global environment, as well as realize the impact that they make on the natural world and appreciate the need for its sustainability.

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

1. Interpret 
diagrams to 
explain changes 
that occur at 
each phase of 
the water cycle. 
 The movement of water from Earth’s 
surface into the air and back to the 
surface again is called the water cycle. 
 The first step in the water cycle is 
evaporation. Evaporation is the 
changing of a liquid into a gas. 
 When the sun heats water liquid water 
changes into a gas - water vapor - 
and  rises into the air. 
 The second step in the water cycle is 
condensation. 
 Recognize

 When the water vapor reaches cooler 
air it condenses, which means it 
changes from a gas to a liquid. This 
forms clouds. 
 Make 
inferences and 
draw 
conclusions

 The drops of water in the clouds join 
up until they are too heavy to float. 
 Then they fall to the ground 
precipitation (rain, snow, hail or 
sleet). 
 Because the cycle keeps repeating 
itself, water is always being recycled.

1. Define vector. 
 
2. Identify animals 
that may be 
vectors and 
spread diseases. 
A vector is any animal that may 
cause and transmit disease. 
In the Bahamas common vectors 
include the following: 
Fleas - Flea bites may cause 
discomfort and an allergic reaction in 
some people. 
Locally, the cat flea is the most 
important flea pest to humans and 
many domestic animals like cats and 
dogs. In other parts of the world, 
plague can be found in wild rodents 
like chipmunks and ground squirrels. 
Houseflies - The common housefly 
is one of the most widely distributed 
insects and has the ability to transmit 
disease to people. Houseflies are 
commonly found in homes and 
restaurants. Because of its close 
association with people and its 
ability to transmit disease, it is 
considered a great threat to humans.

They can carry more than 1 million kinds 
of bacteria on their bodies and can transfer 
these to contaminate surfaces and 
food. The common housefly can transmit 
the pathogens that cause shigellosis, 
typhoid fever, E. coli. and cholera. 
Rats – There are two species of rats that 
commonly become a problem in and 
around homes: the roof rat (black rat) and 
the Norway rat (brown rat). Roof rats and 
Norway rats contaminate food and animal 
feed and may transmit Salmonellosis, 
Leptospirosis and other diseases. These 
diseases may be contracted when food or 
water is contaminated with rat faeces or 
urine and is ingested or contacted by 
humans. 
Rats also harbor ectoparasites such 
as fleas and mites which may come in 
contact with humans and domestic 
animals.

Ticks - Ticks are capable of transmitting 
a wide variety of protozoan, 
bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. 
Ticks may be carried by wild hogs and 
furry animals like dogs. Lyme disease is 
one tick-borne disease of great concern. 
Mosquitoes - Adult female mosquitoes 
may bite humans or other vertebrates, 
including pets, livestock and wildlife to 
obtain the blood required for egg 
development. 
Bites cause skin irritation and may 
become infected especially if the bite is 
scratched. 
Mosquitoes are known to transmit a wide 
range of pathogens, including viruses, 
and protozoans such as the parasite that 
causes malaria. They are known to 
transmit diseases like West Nile, Zika, 
Dengue Fever and Chikungunya.

Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant 
water. If there are lids, old tires and 
containers that may catch rainwater lying 
around your yard, they will provide a 
place within which mosquitoes may lay 
their eggs, grow, and develop through 
their water stages (egg, larval and pupal). 
When mosquitoes meet their needs of 
water, food, and warmth, there will be a 
metamorphosis as they transform from 
larvae into pupae and pupae into adults. 
Larvae get oxygen from the surface. 
They suck in food like an underwater 
vacuum cleaner. They need warmth to 
develop into pupae. Both male and 
female feed mainly on fruit and plant 
nectar, but the female also needs the 
protein in blood to help her eggs 
develop. 
Observation: 
If there are mosquito larva 
present around your 
school, you may let 
students collect samples in 
glass or plastic jars and 
observe using hand lenses 
and microscopes.

Once she's had her fill of blood, she'll rest a 
couple of days before laying her eggs. 
After the airborne portion of their life cycle, 
females return to water to lay a new batch of 
fertile eggs. 
There are over 3,500 mosquito species 
worldwide. Mosquitos carry and spread disease 
to humans and cause millions of deaths every 
year. Only female mosquitoes bite people. 
To protect yourself and prevent mosquito bites 
you should do the following: 
 Empty any freestanding water since it is an 
ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. 
 Wear protective clothing such as long 
sleeves and pants when outdoors in 
mosquito prone areas. 
 Use mosquito nets in and outside areas. 
 Use citronella candles or insect repellent. 
 Use mosquito traps in outdoor areas.

Garbage littered on the land may be 
carried into the sea by rain and wind. 
Pollution makes water and lands unsafe

fertilizers also pollute land and 
contaminate water resources. You can 
keep the water and land clean by not 
dumping. People can make less trash by: 
Reducing – this is really the best way to 
reduce your overall waste footprint. If 
you never buy, use or have, then you will 
not have the waste to manage when 
done. Individuals average about 4.3 
pounds of waste per day and we can all

Reusing - finding uses for items 
versus discarding them into the 
landfill. When possible, we should 
only buy items that can be reused (for 
example reusable shopping bags to 
replace plastic bags). We should 
maintain and  repair what we own, 
donate and give away items before 
you throw them away. 
Upcycling - making a creative or 
useful product from stuff that would 
have ordinarily been thrown away. We 
can find ways to repurpose items by 
finding alternative use for items that no 
longer serve their original purpose. 
Recycling - helps reduce pollution. 
Recycling is the process of converting 
garbage to raw materials and making 
them into new products. Recycling can 
help conserve resources. If aluminum 
is recycled, less bauxite, needs to be 
mined.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method 
❖ 
Cooperative Learning Technique 
❖ 
Student-centred vs. Teacher-centred Learning 
❖ 
Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
 Provide guidance for the students. 


 
  
 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps:

HYPOTHESIS 
PREDICTIONS 
TEST OF PREDICTIONS 
EVALUATION OF HYPOTHESIS

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere. 


332 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and 
teachers. As the internet is constantly changing, some websites may become non-functional, outdated or unsuitable.

Journals and Logs: Science, Conversation, and Writing 
This article from Perspectives in Education and Deafness describes different types of logs and journals and includes ideas for how they can be used in the science classroom. 


 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

I. “OWL STRATEGY” 
Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic. 


350 
 
VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.

SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief systems, such 
as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and beliefs? What does 
language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, sociology and anthropology, 
as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one to 
develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? How has 
the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme typically appears in 
courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things located? 
Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have for people? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to adulthood? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are maintained or 
changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by institutions? How do 
institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with sociology, 
anthropology, psychology, political science and history.  
 
 
 


 
11 | P a g e  
 
 
Power, Authority  
Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is power? What 
form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, structured, maintained 
and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing 
with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of the 
factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic concepts 
and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is new 
technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which is 
unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people benefit 
from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural and physical 
sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, civics and 
government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme typically 
appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. Students 
confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the balance 
between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world community? How can I 
make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, cultural anthropology and 
fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas. Mary Ingraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 


 
xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirations and feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

It’s really easy, easy peasy; 1967 was a year not to be queasy 
Lynden and Randol, short in stature and brave at heart; They both fought and did their part

Lynden threw out the mace and brought a change in the black race; Equality for all was the order of the day 
Not by colour, but knowledge earned our pay

Randol said treat all workers right; Burma Road Riot brought all to light 
Country was shut down until a new era came to town

Election day came and there was a tie; Randol said I can’t lead in a lie 
He cast his vote and brought an end to this white regime; Bringing the nation to new heights and ending shame

By Shari Briggs, Ashly Ferguson, Shatera McIntosh, Latoya Smith

Cricket started in our country in 1846. 
It is the oldest sport being played here, 
In the roads, playground or fields. 
 
What is Cricket? 
What is Cricket?

During the 70s the game declined, 
Because teachers did not know the game. 
They taught track and field and other sports, 
Which buried the cricket name.

RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit

PREFACE 
 
 
 
In the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the predominant religion practiced is Christianity.  The Preamble to the Bahamian Constitution indicates that the 
preservation of our nation’s freedom is predicated upon a “national commitment to self-discipline, industry, loyalty, unity and an abiding respect for Christian 
values.” Therefore, the Religious Studies Curriculum, at the elementary level, is based entirely on Judeo-Christian teachings and principles.   
 
Religious Studies is a core subject at the elementary level and must be taught as a separate subject or as a part of the integrative process.  The Curriculum is 
based on four strands:  Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and Celebrations/Festivals.  Through these broad strands, key 
concepts, values, attitudes and skills are integrated from Grade One to Grade Six.   
 
In this revised document, there is a greater emphasis on the development of skills that students will need to live successfully as national and global citizens.  
Furthermore, grade level standards and benchmarks are clearly outlined in order to consistently monitor student progress and performance.  The curriculum is 
rigorous but it is designed for flexibility and to encourage creativity.

RATIONALE 
 
Throughout our ever-changing world, there is a basic longing for human beings to connect with the spiritual side of their existence.  Even very young children 
express a natural curiosity about their existence and purpose. This curiosity leads to a search to find answers to fundamental questions such as:  Why am I here?  
Why do people suffer? What happens after death?  Religion serves the purpose of connecting human beings with their Creator, enabling them to explore answers 
to some of life’s mysteries.  
 
Religious Studies affords learners opportunities to explore religious beliefs and practices and how they impact individuals and the society.  It enables them to 
consider and respond to fundamental questions about their purpose in life.  It promotes the development of values and morals, enabling students to make informed 
decisions on moral and ethical issues.  Moreover, Religious Studies provides opportunities for students to demonstrate respect for other people, their opinions and 
beliefs. 
 
The aim of Religious Studies, therefore, is to help students develop skills for lifelong learning, enabling them to become productive citizens and stewards of the 
Earth. The Christian beliefs and values that are esteemed in this society will be transmitted to our students, providing them with a foundation on which they can 
develop good character, strengthen social relationships and build strong communities.  Ultimately, students will be equipped with the necessary skills, values and 
attitudes for life and work in the 21st century. 
 
The Religious Studies Curriculum supports the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (2015-2030) which promote equality for all, protection of our 
natural resources and peaceful societies.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


10 
 
OVERARCHING GOAL  
 
Students will understand the major beliefs and teachings of the Christian faith; demonstrate respect for themselves and others and exhibit values and attitudes that 
promote peace and harmony in society. 
 
 
 
 
SUB-GOALS 
 
1) Develop knowledge and understanding of the basic beliefs and teachings of Christianity 
 
2) Learn about their identity and the purposes for which human beings were created 
 
3) Develop moral values and attitudes that will enhance the way we live in communities 
 
4) Understand the importance of Christian celebrations and their influence on culture

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies should be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.   
 
 
The following example indicates how the curriculum objectives are number:

mankind 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because God is holy, it is only 
fitting 
that 
He 
should 
be 
reverenced. Christians show 
reverence to God by bowing 
down and worshiping Him, 
singing songs of praise to Him 
and by avoiding distractions 
during prayer. Reverence is 
also shown in the way the Bible 
and other sacred objects are 
handled. We place God far 
above everything because He 
has 
revealed 
Himself 
to 
mankind through His creation, 
His Word (The Bible) and 
through His Son, Jesus Christ.

2.1. A.3.1. Explain that 
human beings were 
created with the ability 
to think and speak 
 
God created human beings with 
the unique ability to think and 
speak. In Genesis 1:26 God 
said, “Let us make man in our 
image and likeness.” Humans 
are the only animals created 
with a mind to think and 
communicate 
to 
others 
by 
speaking. God gave Adam the 
task of naming all the animals in 
the Garden of Eden.

ways to prepare one’s 
heart for prayer 
 
When coming before God in 
prayer 
we 
must 
show 
reverence and honor Him as 
the most important person. 
Our hearts must also be pure 
(Psalm 24:4).  
 
Some ways we can prepare 
our hearts for prayer are:  
 being still and silent 
 listening to soft worship 
music  
 singing worship songs 
 forgiving others who have 
hurt us 
 bowing our heads  
 kneeling  
 reading a scripture

Human beings should take care 
of the Earth because the Earth 
is our home. It provides us with 
everything we need to survive. If 
human beings don’t take care of 
the Earth, plants and animals 
(including humans) will become 
extinct.  
 
In the story of Noah, God told 
Noah to bring pairs of male and 
female animals into the Ark. 
They cared for the animals on 
the Ark during the flood. The 
animals were able to survive

Each member in the family is 
important. Everyone should

load lighter. The parents are 
caretakers and are important in 
a family.  Children depend on 
them emotionally to show them 
love, to take care of them and 
to provide for them. Children 
are important because they 
can 
assist 
parents 
by 
completing chores around the

or 
religions they must work together. People in a 
community work together to keep the 
community clean. Sometimes they form a

the community safe. They support each other 
through businesses.  Churches often partner 
with schools by donating funds and offering 
assistance where needed.

Consequences are the result of 
our actions. There are good

and 
bad 
consequences. 
However, 
they 
both teach us how to exhibit better 
behaviour.  When we do what is 
right, we are rewarded with good 
consequences. For example if you 
found money lying on the floor in 
our classroom and take it to the 
teacher so that he/she can find the 
rightful owner, you may be given 
praise or even a treat for doing the 
right thing. When we exhibit bad 
actions the consequences for our 
actions will also be bad. For 
example, if you did not study and 
got a low grade the consequence 
may be that your parents may not 
allow you to use your tablet for a

how Christian

Christian 
celebrations/festivals 
have 
helped 
shaped our culture in many ways.  The Christmas 
festival has created cultural practices such as 
going to church, gift-giving, decorating homes, 
shopping and spending time with family members. 
Special foods are eaten like, ham, turkey and 
peas n’ rice.  
 
The Easter season has also impacted our culture.  
Easter is a time of reflection and self-sacrifice.  On 
Good Friday, many Bahamians attend church, 
eat hot cross buns and fried fish, to remember 
Jesus’ death.  On Easter Sunday, we attend 
church dressed in bright colours to symbolize the 
new life of our resurrected Saviour. 
 
Cultural practices related to Pentecost include 
celebrating Pentecost Sunday, and wearing white 
to represent the purity of the Holy Spirit.  Whit 
Monday holiday is celebrated.

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip 
them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They are 
respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as that state of well-
being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human development. 
This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration with Government 
Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will include sensitization and training 
for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit will 
coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, substance abuse 
prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be conducted to 
address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles through 
training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. Life is the most valuable, natural possession to be nurtured and protected at all times by everyone. 
 
2. The stabilization of family is the key to the management of most of the social problems. 
 
3. Health is essential to the well-being of all individuals. 
 
4. Academic achievement and student health and well-being are inextricably linked. 
 
5. HFLE, with its emphasis on prevention and multi-disciplinary approaches, has the potential to address many of the social problems and impact 
behaviors and lifestyles. 
 
6. HFLE aims to address the whole child and to nurture emotional, physical, mental and moral development. It takes into account both affective and 
cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome. 
 
8. HFLE is the means by which positive values, attitudes and behaviors, knowledge and skills can be taught. The core skills, which the young 
develop within HFLE, can be translated into all areas of their lives. 
 
9. HFLE creates an atmosphere of trust, openness, sincerity and honesty, which contributes to positive interpersonal relationships. 
 
10. HFLE draws heavily on the experiences of students and educators and deals with young people in the context of home, school and community 
relationships.  
 
11. HFLE produces individuals who, cognizant of their roles in society, will make a positive contribution to national, regional and international 
development.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in learning, 
the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the development of individuals 
and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many important social, cultural and health issues 
in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown that confident, well-informed and well-supported 
young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the lifelong 
acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In order for 
individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address issues and 
risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 
HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse and drug dealing, negative 
sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, Sexuality 
and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is interrelated and has been 
developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary methods. 
Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of accurate knowledge, skills development and exploration of values and attitudes. Health and Family Life classes 
afford students opportunities to build competencies for healthy self-development to deal with the challenges of life as well as make positive contributions 
to national, regional and international development. 
 
Finally, the activities and ideas presented in this document are not exhaustive.  You may be able to find many more to match the lesson topics and the 
specific objectives.  Please feel free to do this and share your ideas with other teachers for the enrichment of the programme and the development of our 
children.

A disease is a condition that damages or weakens parts of the 
body. There are many causes of diseases.  
 
Communicable or infectious diseases are caused by pathogens. 
Pathogen is an organism or virus that causes disease. Pathogens 
spread disease when they are passed from one person to another. 
Pathogens cause diseases only if they grow and multiply in the 
body. (Review Grade 2, Standard 2.3: How Communicable 
Diseases are Spread).  
 
Immunizations are given to protect people for communicable 
diseases such as meningitis, mumps, measles, rubella and polio. 
Everyone needs these vaccines in order to stay healthy 
 
Non-communicable or Non-infectious Diseases (Review Grade 
2, Standard 2.3: Non Communicable Diseases)  
 
Some diseases and health conditions are preventable.

TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices, and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, values and 
attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. However, 
teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit grades which will 
contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. (sharing 
thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills) 
• Field trips 
• Internships 
• Community Services 
 
Assessment Procedures 
 
Students are assessed based on the following: 
 
Class work and Homework   
60% 
 
Projects and Portfolios  
 
40%

BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will be time 
for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, role play, 
games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication, 
negotiation, assertiveness and cooperation. 
 
12. Ensure that grades are recorded in the mark book for the topics taught (date, topic, and number grade) 
 
13. Establish interactive learning centres in the classroom which should include current teaching aids and samples of students’ activities.  
 
14. Create instructional and motivational bulletin boards/charts that reflect the concepts and skills being taught e.g. family patterns, body parts, hygiene, 
drug abuse prevention, conflict resolution, HIV, AIDS STIs,  nutrition, environment issues, self-esteem, teamwork, etc.

TEACHING GOOD VALUES AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP 
 
 
Dr. Marian Bock, Director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle’s Virtues Project, defines virtues as universal positive character traits. She defines 
values as agreements, rules, principles, codes and beliefs about how to practice these virtues. Bock recommends integrating fifty-two universal virtues 
into appropriate family life classes by encouraging students to recognize them in themselves and others.

address the needs of students 
and to empower them with 
skills and attitudes required 
for personal development 
and for active participation in 
society. 
 
The rationale to implement

was based on the high rate of 
teenage pregnancy along 
with other related social 
problems in the society.  
 
The curriculum was 
Designed to address issues 
and as well as promote 
values and appropriate 
behaviours. 
 
The rationale for

in addressing sexual issues 
and to address the limited 
learning about health 
issues such as sexuality, 
eating and fitness and 
interpersonal relationships. 
 
The curriculum was 
designed to prepare 
children and young people 
for the challenges of 
adolescence and adulthood. 
 
It also provided awareness 
among children and young 
people about the 
relationship between their 
health and the choices they 
make in everyday life. 
 
The Personal and Social 
Curriculum focused on 
developing the personality 
in its entire dimension: 
physically, intellectual and 
emotional. 
 
The curriculum was designed 
to address the following: 
 
Students’ knowledge, 
understanding and skills. 
 
Risks factors and re-
emerging diseases and the 
emergence of relatively new 
diseases.

PREFACE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This curriculum has been developed to assist in the dissemination of Physical Education activities and techniques.  It is hoped that this curriculum will assist all 
practitioners of the subject, especially our colleagues in the Family Islands, to improve their delivery of the subject.  It has been said that “the greatest gift that can be given, 
is the gift of knowledge” (author unknown). 
 
It is the hope of all of the professionals who assisted in the compilation of this work, that it will be a source of inspiration and a valuable tool in the tool-box of knowledge 
and instruction to all Physical Education instructors.

RATIONALE 
 
Physical Education is the nucleus of healthy lifestyles and caters significantly to the physically educated citizens. 
It is through this medium that an invaluable learning experience unfolds, allowing all learners to access the knowledge, skills and attitudes that shape their lives through 
this active learning process. 
 
This process of learning embraces the values placed on life and secures each individual in his personal experiences, as these experiences coincide with the stream of things, 
both cognitive and physical in every pursuit. 
 
We must continue to be cognizant of the fact that the needs and experiences of our youth must not be ignored in our planning, for it is through their experiences and 
enjoyment of movement that they will find Physical Education enjoyable.  Regular physical activity is pertinent to the development of the “whole man “.  For children, it is 
through this kind of physical activity and movements that they zoom in on their lives as a whole, critical to all aspects of their development, including the psychomotor, 
cognitive and affective domains.  Therefore, the well-being of individuals depends greatly on the soundness of the Physical Education programme. 
 
In the structured Physical Education programme, consideration must be given to the level of safety of the learners, so as to provide a nurturing environment that would 
enable the development of functional levels of activity, including specific motor skills and functional physical fitness.  The learners Physical Education experiences and 
development must be geared towards appropriate values, personal and social behaviors. 
 
In summary, each individual learner should be progressively assessed in order that their needs are met, providing the opportunity for all to partake in these unique 
experiences equally. 
 
It must therefore be observed, that Physical Education should not be confused with the activities of private sports clubs, sports organizations, or inter-school athletic 
competitions, because these function only to complement this process.  Physical Education is a structured well-balance programme which provides the physically educated 
persons with exciting experience from the knowledge of its nature, skills and developed positive attitudes from its practice; engendering daily routines and leisure pursuits 
through life. 
 
A well-structured and vibrant physical education programme is essential in our Nation as we are in pursuit of excellence.  This active learning will foster personal growth of 
the individual through Physical Education, therefore enhancing the skills necessary to meet the challenges of an ever-changing society. 
 
Thus, an investment in the Physical Education of our children is an investment in the long-term health and prosperity of our Bahama land for years to come.

PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
 
The new direction of Physical Education at Primary level is to provide all students with a safe, enjoyable and nurturing environment where physical activity and the 
development of motor skills will be enhanced.  Each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her potential through the acquisition of knowledge, and skills 
that will transfer to a healthy lifestyle and lifelong sports.  The base of the Physical Programme is Body Management Competence, which gives focus to the development of 
fundamental skills that lead into specialized skills training.  Primary students will also participate in the core sports such as Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, Soccer 
and Track and Field.   Interschool competitions take place in all of the “core sports” aforementioned including, Mini- tennis.  It is the responsibility of the New Providence 
Primary School Sports Association in collaboration with the Department of Education and the various Sports Factions to organize and conduct the competitions, 
reinforcing the principles of fair play, sportsmanship and self-control.

CONTENT STANDARDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
1. Demonstrates competency and proficiency in movement forms. 
The intent of this standard is to develop competence and proficiency in movement.  In preparation for adulthood, students should have acquired the basic skills to 
participate in a wide variety of leisure and work- related physical activities and advance in at least two or three areas. 
 
2. Apply movement concept and principles to learning and development of motor skills. 
This standard concerns the ability of the learner to use cognitive information to understand and enhance motor skills.  By graduation the student should have developed 
sufficient knowledge and ability to independently use their learned behavior to acquire new skills while continuing to refine existing ones. 
 
3. Exhibits physically active lifestyles. 
The intent of this standard is to establish patterns of regular participation in meaningful physical activity.  This standard should connect what was done in physical 
education classes with the lives of students outside of class. 
4. Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 
This standard is for the student to achieve a health-enhancing level of physical fitness.  Student should be encouraged to develop higher levels of basic fitness and 
physical competence as needed for many work situations and active leisure participation.  Students should have both the ability and the willingness to accept 
responsibility for personal fitness leading to an active, healthy lifestyle. 
 
5. Demonstrates responsible personal and social behaviors in physical activity settings. 
Achievement of this standard includes safe practices, adherence to rules and procedure, etiquette, cooperation and teamwork, and positive social interaction. 
 
6. Show respect for differences among people in physical activity settings. 
The intent of this standard is to develop respect for individual similarities and differences through positive interaction among participants in physical activity.  
Similarities and differences include characteristics of culture, ethnicity, motor performance, disabilities, physical characteristics (strength, size, and shape), gender, race 
and socioeconomic status.  
 
7. Recognize that physical activity opportunities are for enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. 
As a result of these intrinsic benefits of participation, students will begin to actively pursue lifelong physical activities that meet their own needs.

SPRINTS 
- 
Sprinting ranges from the short 50 meters 
to the long sprint of 400 meters.  
Sprinting consists of two basic principles: 
stride length and stride speed.  There are 
three parts of effective sprinting: the start, 
efficient running form, and the finish.  
Each of these basic parts of the total 
sprint effort has essential demands.  
Sprinting form is a very individual matter 
because of differences in body builds. 
However, fundamental running 
movements can be described in general 
terms of correct foot placement, arm 
action, shoulder and head angles, body 
alignment, and leg and knee action. 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Emphasize the toes pointing straight 
ahead for efficient running. 
 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms are used for balance 
- 
Fingers should be relaxed 
- 
The arm moves driving the elbow 
forward and back, never passing higher 
than the armpit on the forward swing and 
never further than six inches beyond the 
hips. 
Read “Track and Field,” pg. 48 from the 
Physical Education Theory Workbook, 
Grade 4-6 
The skill should be: 
- 
Done at 50 – 75% speed 
- 
Concentrated on upright body 
position.

running, sprinting, 
walking, striding and 
jogging. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Arms never cross the midline of the body. 
 
BODY ALIGNMENT 
- 
The runner should rise up on his or her 
toes and lean forward to where a position 
of balance is barely maintained; that is the 
correct body angle.  Forward angle is best 
when accelerating. 
 
 
SHOULDERS 
- 
The shoulder should be relaxed with little 
or no rotation. 
 
HEAD 
- 
The head should be straight ahead with 
eyes focused on the finish line. 
- 
The face (jaws and facial muscles) should 
be relaxed. 
 
 
LEG ACTION AND KNEE LIFT 
- 
Knees should be lifted sharply forward 
and upward and then brought down with 
vigorous motion followed by a forceful 
push of the toe. 
- 
The sprinter should run on the balls of 
the foot, using a pushing action to get 
drive against the surface of the track. 
- 
Maintain stride length regardless of 
fatigue, run relaxed. 
 
THE FINISH 
- 
When finishing, run through the finish 
line with a straight body; lean in the last 
stride. 
- 
Strengthen opposite muscles to 
prevent injury.

- 
Long sprint – group all runners 
by ability (three or four groups).  
Run 200 – 400 meters, one group 
at a time.  Repeat two - three 
times.  Relays should be a 
measure by itself.

MIDDLE DISTANCE EVENTS  
 
As the distance increases from sprints to middle 
distance events, running form changes; strides are 
shorter, the foot strike is more toward the ball of 
the foot rather than on the toes, arm carriage is 
lower and less vigorous in middle distance 
training, there must be more running. Runners 
should start by building on slow, long distances 
through intervals with short recovery periods.  
Distance runners should run relaxed, 
concentrating on a steady, even-paced rhythm.  
The basic essentials of efficient running involve: 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Foot should be pointed straight ahead.  
The foot strike is more the ball of the 
foot. 
 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms play a balancing role in running 
- 
The arms should be kept at a 90 degree 
angle with thumbs up. 
- 
As the arms move forward and back in 
position, they should never pass higher 
than the chest on the forward move and 
never further than the hips. 
- 
The arms should never cross the middle 
of the body. 
Body alignment  
- 
Once running speed is achieved, the 
body’s angle tends toward the 
perpendicular. 
- 
The body is held almost erect with the 
shoulders and face relaxed. 
- 
There should be little or no rotation in the 
- 
Done 50% pace.  
 
- 
Concentrate on endurance, 
strength, speed and breathing.

upper body. 
 
Stride Length 
- 
The slower the speed of the arm, the 
shorter the stride. 
- 
Longer strides require more energy: in 
distance running where economy of 
energy is important, runners should take 
natural strides. 
 
Breathing 
- 
The runner should keep the jaw relaxed 
and breathe through the nose and mouth 
simultaneously. 
 
Relays in track and field today 
There are two common types of relay in primary 
school track and field.  They are:  
i. 
4 x 100 Meter Relay 
ii. 
4 x 400 Meter Relay 
- 
All relay events consist of four runners. 
- 
All four runners need to understand Baton 
handling, border positions and zone 
awareness. 
 
4 x 100 Meter Relays 
- 
The four runners who make up the relay 
team must stay in their designated lane for 
the entire race. 
Each runner will have to run 100 meters 
before handing off the Baton.

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them with the 
necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an independent, ever-changing world. 
Visual Arts Unit 
Vision 
We envision an art education programme in which all students in The Bahamas are guided toward literacy, an appreciation of Artists, craft persons, and Bahamian 
culture. We also envision an art education programme that is comprehensive and will nurture the spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, creative, imaginative, aesthetic, 
social and physical wellbeing of the child. 
Mission Statement 
Our mission is to advance art education through appropriate curriculum, teacher development programmes, stimulating environments, the provision of materials and 
relevant information. By doing so, we provide students with learning experiences that focus on their creative development, aesthetic appreciation, critical thinking and 
cultural awareness as well as inter-disciplinary integration. 
Belief Statement 
Art education is beneficial to all students regardless of social, ethnic, economic or educational background. Art is an integral part of the overall educational development 
of the student as it compliments and unites other disciplines while promoting visual literacy skills, imaginative thinking and visual communication. 
We further believe that: 
• Art education provides students with the means to think critically, experience, and understand the world around them in unique ways. 
• Art enables students to become self-directed and lifelong learners. 
• Art provides learning opportunities of varying abilities. 
• Art education enhances the ability to interact in society by developing creative problem solving, inquiry, and communication skills, and by providing an avenue 
for self-expression and multiple points of view. 
• Students develop attitudes of appreciation, self-worth, joy in the creation of artworks, and in viewing the works of other students and artists.

• Art is a way to appreciate the beauty and value of the environment and the preservation of our heritage. 
• Art provides opportunities to exhibit in classrooms, schools, art centres and museums, sharing the art curriculum with the community, teachers, students, and 
examiners. 
• Art education increases awareness of career possibilities, promotes entrepreneurial skills and highlights our community’s visual resources. 
• Art education reflects and influences the cultural, social, political and economic aspirations and concerns of our society. 
• Art is a way to appreciate differences and promotes cultural, social and ethnic similarities.

and cool colours; 
Warm Colours 
What Is a Warm Color? The colours red, 
orange, and yellow are warm because

use colour in their 
work 
• Analyze how colour 
influences moods 
and feelings 
• Compare and 
contrast how 
colours can convey 
mood 
they make us think of fire and the sun 
or things that make us feel warm. 
Cool Colours 
Cool colours include green, blue, and 
purple. They are called cool colours 
because they make us think of things 
that make us feel cool such as the sea 
and trees. 
• Paint Warm/Cool Colour Landscapes and 
Seascapes

information of colour and 
mood to create an 
artwork. 
 
 
Value 
• Differentiate 
between the 
lightness and 
darkness of colours 
in art and nature. 
• Compare and 
contrast the range of 
hues  
• Produce work with a 
variety of tints and 
shades. 
Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a colour 
can be.  Add white to a colour to make it 
light and add black to a colour to make 
it dark. When black is added to a colour 
it creates a SHADE. When white is 
added to a colour you create a TINT. 
White is the lightest value; black is the 
darkest. Value is important to drawing 
and painting, value changes are what 
creates contrast. Contrast helps us 
understand 2-D artworks.  
• Mix the secondary colours then darken each by 
adding black 
• Make 3 values of each primary colour, light, 
medium and dark 
• Paper collage different colour values together in 
fun shapes and designs 
• Tints and shades with a cherry on top 
• Use stamp pads to create value scales 
• Students examine similarities and differences in 
colour eg. Light blue, dark blue 
• Paint pictures using exclusively light or dark 
colours

Pattern, Rhythm & 
Movement 
• Recognize patterns 
around them 
• Describe a pattern 
• Examine how artists 
use patterns as a 
form of expression 
• Experiment with 
lines, shapes and 
colours to produce 
patterns using a 
variety of media 
• Perceive and 
describe rhythm 
and movement in 
works of art and the 
environment. 
• Create a piece of art 
emphasizing rhythm 
and movement, 
using a chosen 
printing method. 
Patterns  
Patterns can be found everywhere in 
our daily lives, on tree leaves and 
trunks, waves, butterfly wings, sea 
shells and lots more. 
These are created by repeating lines, 
shapes and colours. The part 
that is repeated is called a 
motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art through 
repeating lines, shapes, colours, and 
more. Rhythm creates a mood like 
music or dancing. The best example of 
movement in art is Vincent van 
Gogh's The Starry Night, which takes 
your eyes on a rollercoaster ride 
around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears. 
Visual rhythm is created by repeated 
positive shapes separated by negative 
spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your eye 
through the artwork. 
Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements in 
• Patterned hands 
• Pattern landscapes 
• Nature walk for patterns 
• Look at work by the artist Piet Mondrian 
• Line patterns

their artwork using the same size and 
length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples include 
flowers, clouds, or waves. Flowing 
rhythm is when organic shapes are 
repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, but 
we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes in 
a way that would lead the viewer’s eyes 
from one point to the next in their 
paintings, or use certain brush 
techniques to mimic the movement. 
 
Texture 
• Explore how 
patterns can be used 
to create texture 
• Describe the look 
and feel of a variety 
of textures 
Texture  
Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough.

Egyptian Art 
We learn about the Ancient Egyptians 
from their art. From their art, we can 
learn things like what they looked like, 
what kind of clothes they wore, what 
jobs they had, and what was important 
to them. 
The artwork created by the Ancient 
Egyptians had to do with their religion. 
They would fill the walls of the tombs of 
the Pharaohs with paintings and 
sculptures that were there to help the 
Pharaohs in the afterlife. Temples were

another popular place for art. The 
temples often held large statues of their 
gods as well as many paintings on the 
walls.  
The Egyptians are famous for their 
giant sculptures, an example of this is 
the Great Sphinx at Giza.  The Sphinx is 
over 240 feet long.

Space is determined by where an 
object is situated; It can be created 
using colour, shapes and values. 
Positive  
This is the object being drawn like an 
apple or a car. 
Negative 
This is the space that is left empty. It is 
the space around and between objects.

Balance 
• Identify and use 
symmetrical and 
asymmetrical 
balance 
• Analyze how artists 
use the balance in 
their work 
• Produce artwork

balance 
 
Balance 
The way parts of a picture are 
arranged is called balance. 
Artists use balance in their artwork to 
give equal weight to both sides of their 
designs. 
1. Size. Larger objects have more 
visual weight than smaller 
objects. 
2. Colour. Bright colours are 
visually heavier than dull 
colours. 
Symmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of artwork 
or an object are identical. 
Asymmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of artwork 
or any object are different or not the 
same. In Asymmetrical balance in art, 
each half is different but has equal

Georges Seurat 
“Georges Seurat was born in Paris, 
France on December 2nd 1859. His 
parents were wealthy allowing him to 
focus on his art. He was a quiet and 
intelligent child who kept to himself. 
Georges attended the School of Fine 
Arts in Paris starting in 1878. He also 
had to serve a year in the military. 
Upon his return to Paris, he continued 
to refine his art skills. He spent the next 
two years drawing in black and white. 
With the help of his parents, Georges 
set up his art studio not far from their 
house. Because his parents supported 
him, George was able to paint and 
explore any areas of art he chose. Most 
of the poor artists at the time had to 
sell their paintings to survive. Seurat 
began to explore the science of optics 
and colour. He found that, rather than 
mixing the colours of paint on a palette, 
he could place tiny dots of different 
colours next to each other on the 
canvas and the eye would mix the 
colours. He called this way of painting 
Divisionism. Today we call it 
Pointillism. Seurat felt that this new

appear more brilliant to the viewer. 
When Georges was just 31 years old he 
became very sick and died. He likely 
died from meningitis.”
