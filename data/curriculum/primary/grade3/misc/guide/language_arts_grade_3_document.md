PREFACE 
 
 
To assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum, several strategies were employed.  The process 
began with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions.  These countries included 
Jamaica, the United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois) Canada and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 
guides).  The documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their 
rationale and philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as 
well as the Scope of Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa 
and several other countries were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of 
English and the Ministry of Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.    
 
Opportunities were also provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers 
throughout The Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen 
teachers throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students in order to get 
their feedback on what they wanted to learn about and the types of learning activities that they enjoyed.  Additionally, a 
focus group was conducted with members from the community that included business owners, parents and those who 
interact with students in after school clubs and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary teachers, one preschool teacher and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment 
Section.  Opportunities were also provided for several of the Family Island teachers to submit content and activities 
through the Education Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time 
engaged in research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction in order to meet the needs 
of their students.

literacies, enabling them to make meaningful contributions as nation builders who are globally competitive. 
 
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of the Department and Ministry of Education is to provide all persons in The Bahamas an opportunity to 
receive a quality education that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, knowledge, attitudes and skills required for life, 
both in a democratic society guided by Christian values and in an interdependent and changing world.

BELIEF STATEMENTS   
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student centered; 
2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make decisions as well as to develop self- 
confidence and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme 
and should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing 
sixth grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our 
students receive at the primary level, lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that 
students are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on the communication skills.  During this particular period in our history, knowledge of the basic 
communication skills is essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and 
more people are being pushed to use on-line services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct 
banking transactions, to pay bills, to make travel arrangements, to access government services and so much more.   
Additionally, changes in technology demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Land lines, 
that only required listening and speaking skills for its use, have been replaced with smart phones and computers where 
we can communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the 
internet, buy tickets, post to Facebook, create blogs, Snapchat, conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the 
world and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be that confidence in our education system that students 
will be prepared to communicate effectively in spite of the changes that occur.  Recognizing that the Language Arts skills 
are the foundation of all learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on 
producing students who are not only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability 
to communicate effectively in a rapidly advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves 
creatively, to collaborate and to problem solve as we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which 
speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education for all...”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of 
Oracy, Reading and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that 
they will need to become life-long learners and to navigate successfully in an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM  
 
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, 
teachers should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area 
subjects and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual fieldtrips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centers, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level in order to provide teachers and parents with a guide 
for what students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This 
information should be used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also provides an 
indication of the level of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become 
proficient in a particular area, teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted in 
order to make them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the 
end of the course of study.  Teachers should be guided by the content which indicates what students should know 
or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading 
(Phonemic Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar and 
Composition Writing). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds 
on the previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided 
into three categories:  basic, intermediate and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can 


21 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
access content and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to do so, in order to 
meet the needs of their students.   
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of 
opportunities should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with 
various audiences.  They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large 
group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative 
projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary 
safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with 
students.  Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  In order to avoid 
duplication in the curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best 
applied.  It is expected that once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the 
strands and that they can be assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught the Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This 
particularly refers to reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be 
highlighted.  Students are to be exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are 
taught through teacher read-alouds and independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade 
level. 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading and after reading. 
 
 
 


22 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening   
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in the area of reading still 
have opportunities to understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (through the use of pictures, video 
clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions    
as students connect skills to their everyday experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle  
the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing to see if students have mastered the skill is to have them  
incorporate it in a writing exercise.  This will give them an opportunity to apply what they have learnt.  Students who 
are able to apply reading skills, would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  Following this      
method of teaching the comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into  
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as 
ends in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and 
Handwriting; however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in 
the case of Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should 
only be scored for what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week the number of 
items on the checklist should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the 
checklist should be continually reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been 
generated.  Students should be aware of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to 
assess their own writing before it is even submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, 
mechanics and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three 
lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of 
grade two cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will 
be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, 
and words from the grade level word list included in the appendices of this document.

SCOPE OF WORK 
LISTENING AND SPEAKING 
 
Sub-Goal 1:  Engage effectively in listening and speaking situations for different purposes and audiences, and 
communicate using a variety of media. 
 
Objective 1.1  Display the characteristics of a good listener. 
Content 
Suggested 
 Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
It is important to listen attentively 
when someone is speaking.  When we 
do not, we sometimes miss important 
information. 
 
A good listener: 
 
sits upright in the chair with feet firmly 
on the floor; 
 
looks at the person who is speaking; 
 
has hands that are free of pencils, 
papers, toys or similar items that can 
distract; 
 
does not speak while someone else is 
speaking; 
 
focuses on what the speaker is 
saying; 
 
formulates appropriate questions to 
ask. 
 
thinks critically about what is being 
said. 
 
responds appropriately. 
Basic:  Have students peruse 
magazines and newspapers.  
Have them create a collage of 
individuals who are exhibiting 
good listening behaviours. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
design a poster of listening 
rules with appropriate pictures 
to illustrate each one. 
 
Advanced:  Ahead of class 
record the students during a 
lesson where they had to listen 
to a presentation.  Play the 
video of the class.  Have 
students evaluate whether or 
not they were good listeners. 
 Have the class take 
turns introducing 
themselves and 
talking about their 
hobbies.  Inform the 
students that as they 
are listening to the 
presentations, they 
will be assessed as 
to how well they are 
displaying the 
characteristics of a 
good listener.  The 
teacher can use a 
checklist to assist 
with this.  
 Have students 
assess themselves 
on how well they 
listened.   
 
 magazines, 
newspapers, 
chart paper and 
video recording 
device.

Suggested Assessment 
Resources 
 
Standard English is a term applied to 
language that is grammatically 
correct with no dialect. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can 
get in the way of good 
communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class 
or with a more formal audience.   
Other occasions could be when 
conducting a class assembly, 
participating in a Christmas play etc. 
 
The Bahamian dialect can be used 
when speaking in more informal 
settings.  It has its own special 
vocabulary as well as a specific way 
of pronouncing words. 
 
It includes words like: 
gern= going 
yinna= you all 
chile= child,  
kimba=waist 
 
Dialect can be used when speaking 
informally with family, friends or 
neighbours.   
 
Basic: Read poetry or books 
containing Bahamian dialect 
like O Con Jessie by Susan J. 
Wallace.  Have students 
discuss the meaning of certain 
words or phrases.  Ask 
students to share places where 
they hear dialect and Standard 
English spoken.  Discuss the 
appropriateness of the 
situation. 
 
Intermediate:   Have students 
compile a list of places or 
occasions when dialect is 
appropriate to use and when 
Standard English should be 
used.

of Bahamian sayings. E.g.  
make up ya face like a squall 
of rain (face distorted by 
frowning or pouting).   Have

like this might be used. 
Provide different 
scenarios and have 
students indicate whether 
it is appropriate to speak

Phoneme deletion is when a new 
word is formed when a sound 
(phoneme) is removed from a word. 
  
Example:  
If the /f/ sound is taken away from 
the word ‘farm,’ the new word is 
‘arm.’ 
 
Basic: Have students 
participate in the activity 
What’s my Word? Have 
students give the new word 
when a sound is deleted from 
a given word. 
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students use letter tiles to 
form new words when a 
given sound is deleted from 
words given. 
  
Advanced:  Distribute cards 
with words that are formed 
when a given sound is 
deleted from words provided. 
Say a word, then delete a 
given sound. Have the 
students show the new word 
formed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students write new 
words when given sounds 
are deleted in words.

A rhyme is a repetition of identical or 
similar sounds in two or more 
different words. 
  
A syllable can be divided into two 
parts: onsets and rimes. 
 
The onset is the initial consonant or 
consonant blend/digraph of the word 
that precedes the vowel. The rime is 
the part of the word that contains the 
vowel and the consonants that follow 
it. 
 
In the word ‘crack’, ‘cr’ is the onset 
and ‘ack’ is the rime. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students 
recite/read a nursery 
rhyme/poem. Then choose 
several rhyming word pairs 
from the rhyme/poem and 
draw pictures to represent 
the words. 
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students make a “rhyming 
book’ by using pictures from 
magazines/newspapers or 
pictures they have drawn. 
Have students label the 
pictures to show rhyming 
patterns.

Words are composed of letters 
that represent sounds. 
  
A sound can be represented by 
different letters or letter 
combinations.  
 
Example: the vowel ‘i’ in: ‘hide’, 
‘find’, ‘high’, and ‘pie’ 
 
The same letter/s may represent 
different sounds. 
 
Example: the letters ‘ou’ together 
make a different sound in these 
words: 
‘rough’, ‘dough’, 
 
Basic:  Have students play the 
game Hot Potato. Give students 
a specific letter sound for the 
game. Play music, when the 
music stops, the child holding 
the potato must give a word that 
has the specific sound. 
  
Intermediate:  Divide students 
into two teams. While saying a 
word, emphasize a specific 
sound in the word. Have 
students, one from each team, 
go to the board and write a word 
that has the specific sound 
given by the teacher.  
Example: Write a word that has 
the same sound heard at the

Consonant letters are: b, c, d, f, g, 
h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, 
y, and z. They can be found at the 
beginning, in the middle or at the 
end of words. 
  
Consonants usually represent a 
single sound consistently. However, 
some exceptions are the letters ‘g’, 
‘c’ and ‘x’ which have two sounds. 
 
The letter ‘q’ which makes the /kw/ 
sound, is almost always followed by 
‘u’ in English words.   
  
The consonants ‘w’ and ‘y’ when 
positioned at the beginning of a 
word say their consonant sounds. 
However, when they are placed in 
the middle or at the end of a word, 
they behave as vowels. 
Basic:  Have students divide a 
sheet of paper into three 
columns with the labels initial, 
middle and final. Draw or pull 
a consonant from a bag or 
box. Have students write a 
word that has that consonant 
in each position on their 
paper. 
  
Intermediate: Have students 
create Bingo cards with given 
words. Give clues that 
describe a phonic element for 
the words. Example: Find a 
word that has the /t/ sound at 
the end. Have students place 
a marker on the correct word. 
  
Advanced:  Give groups of 
students a set of alphabet 
cards. Have one member call 
a consonant and indicate if 
the sound should be at the 
beginning, middle or end. 
Then have students form a 
word with the consonant in 
the stated position. 
Have students complete 
given words in sentences 
with missing consonants.

Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
A vowel is a speech sound which is 
produced without any closure of the 
mouth.  A vowel is an open 
phoneme (there is no obstruction by 
the tongue, lips or teeth of air flow). 
  
Short vowels have little tension in 
the vocal chords. 
  
Short vowel patterns:  
CVC: consonant – vowel – 
consonant  
The vowel is between two 
consonants.   
Examples: ‘jam’, ‘big’ and ‘cup’. 
  
VC: vowel – consonant 
When a word or syllable has only 
one vowel, the vowel can come at 
the beginning of the word. 
Examples: ‘act’ and ‘in’. 
  
CCVC: consonant blend-vowel-
consonant 
When a vowel comes between two 
consonants, it usually stands for a 
short sound.                        
Examples: ‘club’, ‘stem’, ‘black’. 
Basic: Place the pattern headings 
on the board (CVC, VC, and 
CCVC). Distribute word / picture 
cards with cvc, vc, and ccvc 
patterns to students. Have students 
read the words or give picture 
names. Ask students to sort their 
words / pictures under the correct 
heading. 
  
Intermediate:  Pair students. Give 
students a set of short vowel word 
cards (20-25) and a timer for each 
pair of students. Have students take 
turns showing each other the cards 
one at a time. Students must read 
the words on the card.  If a word is 
misread, it is placed on the table. 
As one student reads his / her 
words, the other times the reading 
for one minute.   
  
Advanced:  Use the Language 
Experience Approach to write a 
story with the students containing 
short vowel words. Underline the 
short vowel words and add them to 
the word wall. 
 
Have students 
complete sentences 
by writing missing 
words that contain 
short vowel sounds.

Content 
Suggested 
 Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
A vowel is an open phoneme (there 
is no obstruction by the tongue, lips 
or teeth of air flow). Long vowels are 
spoken with more tension in the 
tongue muscles.  
 
Long Vowel Patterns 
 
CVCE Pattern - CVCE stands for 
consonant – vowel – consonant – 
final e. In one syllable words 
containing two vowel letters, one of 
which is a final e, the first vowel 
usually represents a long vowel 
sound, and the ‘e’ is silent  
Examples: ‘bake’, ‘time’ and ‘hose’.  
 
CVVC Pattern -Two adjacent 
vowels- When two vowels appear 
together in a word, the first vowel 
usually gives its long sound and the 
vowel that follows is silent. 
Examples: ‘neat’, ‘goat and ‘hail’   
 
CV Pattern - Consonant – vowel 
In a one-syllable word, the vowel that 
follows the consonant is usually long.  
Examples: ‘so’, ‘he’ and ‘no’. 
 
Basic:  Provide students with 
two signs that say short and 
long.  Present a power point 
presentation of words with 
long and short vowel sounds.  
Ask students to hold up the 
sign that corresponds with 
the correct vowel sound in 
the word displayed.  
  
Intermediate:  Ask students 
to divide papers into two 
columns.  Label one column 
Long Vowel Sounds and the 
other Short Vowel Sounds.  
Allow students to listen to a 
radio ad and record words 
that they hear that belong in 
each group. 
  
Advanced:  Have students 
create tongue twisters using 
various long vowel 
phonograms. 
 
Using the cloze 
procedure, have 
students complete 
sentences by writing 
missing words that 
contain long vowel 
sounds.

Long Vowel Patterns Cont’d.  
 
Y as a vowel - The letter y can 
sometimes have a vowel sound 
instead of a consonant sound.  
In a one syllable word the letter y at 
the end of a word makes the long ī 
sound.  
Examples: ‘dry’, ‘cry’ and ‘fly’  
 
If y comes at the end of a word with 
more than one syllable, it usually has 
a long ē sound.                    
Examples: ‘penny’, ‘pony’ and ‘fairy’ 
 
Basic:  Form two teams in 
the class. Give each team a 
shaker / bell to be passed 
from player to player. Call 
words that individually begin 
with ‘y’. The first player to 
ring the bell (shaker) and 
correctly identify how the 
letter ‘y’ is used in the word 
(as a consonant or a vowel) 
gets a point for their team. 
  
Intermediate: Have students 
participate in a word hunt for 
words with ‘y’ as a vowel in a 
given passage. Have 
students record words under 
the correct headings (Long ē 
words / Long ī words. 
  
Advanced:  Have students

Resources 
 
A syllable is a word or part of a word with 
a vowel sound. The number of vowel 
sounds heard in a word determines the 
number of syllables the word will have.  
 
Syllabication Rules:  
i. When two vowels come together in a 
word and are sounded separately, divide 
the word between the two vowels.              
Example:  di-et  
 
ii. When a word ends in -le preceded by 
a consonant, divide the word before that 
consonant.                                Example:  
cir-cle  
 
iii. When a vowel is paired with the letter 
r, the two letters have one vowel sound 
which is the r-controlled vowel. Example: 
turn 
 
Iv. When a word has a suffix with a vowel 
sound in it, divide the word between the 
base word and the suffix. Example:  fly-
ing  
 
v. When a word has a prefix, divide the 
word between the prefix and the base 
word.                                             
Example:  re-new 
Basic:  Have students 
divide a page into three 
columns and label them 
1, 2 and 3. Call a word.  
Have  students write in 
Column 1, the number of 
vowels heard in the word.  
In Column 2, print the 
vowel sounds heard.  In 
Column 3, write the 
number of syllables. 
 
Intermediate: Have 
students read words in 
the context of sentences 
that follow the various 
syllabication rules.   
  
Advanced:  Dictate 
various words to students 
stressing syllables. Have 
students write words, and 
then use them in 
sentences.  
 
 
 
 
 
Have students use their

Suggested  
Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
A contraction is a short way to 
write two words.  It is written 
by putting two words together 
and leaving out a letter or 
letters.  An apostrophe (‘) 
takes the place of the letter(s) 
that are left out. 
 
Examples:  
would have       
would +  have = would’ve 
 
The apostrophe shows where 
the “h” and “a” would have 
been, had the words been 
written out in full. 
 
should not 
should + not = shouldn’t 
 
The apostrophe shows where 
the “o” would have been, had 
the words been written out in 
full. 
 
Basic:  Divide index cards into an 
equal amount. On one set write 
contractions and on the other set 
write the two words that make up 
the contractions. Distribute cards to 
all of the students in the class.  At a 
signal have students find their 
partner and sit with them.  Have 
each pair share their words. 
 
Intermediate:   Have students take 
on the role of a surgeon. Dress 
them in the appropriate attire, 
including a surgical mask. Tell that 
they will perform ‘surgery’ on two 
words. Have them cut the words 
apart and sew them back together 
with paper clips. Afterwards, let 
them add a ‘bandage’ (transparent 
tape) and write in the apostrophe 
which is the ‘scar’ from the surgery.

A base word is the simplest form of a 
word. It is also a word to which a prefix, 
suffix or ending can be added to form a 
new word. 
Examples: ‘Print’ and ‘seen’  
  
A prefix is a syllable added to the 
beginning of a word to change the word’s 
meaning. 
‘Re’ and ‘un’ are prefixes. 
re – again 
un – not 
 
Examples:  
re (prefix) +print (base word) = reprint 
(print again) 
un (prefix) + seen (base) = unseen (not 
seen) 
  
A suffix is a syllable added to the end of 
a base word to change the word’s 
meaning. 
 
Examples: ‘safe’ and ‘play’  
‘Ly’ and ‘ful’ are suffixes. 
ly- to make 
ful – full of 
  
safe + ly (suffix) = safely (to make safe) 
play + ful (suffix) =playful (full of play} 
 
Basic:  Divide the students into 
groups to play Concentration. 
Write prefixes (or suffixes) on 
half of the cards. Write base 
words on the other half of the 
card. Have students match a 
prefix (or suffix) with an 
appropriate base word. The 
students with the most pairs 
win. 
  
Intermediate: Divide students 
into teams.  Give them five 
minutes to review a list of ten 
prefixes and their meanings.  
Display a card with a prefix on 
it.  The first team to provide its 
meaning wins a point.  The 
team with the most points once 
all of the cards have been 
revealed wins.  The same 
game can be played using the 
suffix cards.  
     
Advanced:  Have students 
match base words with a prefix 
or suffix to form a new word 
then give the meaning of the 
word formed.  
Have students label 
four columns: 
‘Prefix’, ‘Base Word’, 
‘Suffix’ and 
‘Meaning’. Using a 
word list provided,

Content 
Suggested 
 Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
An inflectional ending is a letter or group 
of letters added to a base word to 
change its meaning. 
 
-ing 
The ending –ing added to a word tells 
about something that is happening now. 
  
-ed 
When –ed is added to the end of a word 
it tells of something that happened in 
the past. 
  
Whenever a short vowel word ends with 
one consonant, the last consonant is 
usually doubled before adding a suffix 
or ending that begins with a vowel 
(examples: -ed / -ing). 
 
Examples:  
shop – shopped/shopping 
stop - stopped/stopping 
 
In a one-syllable word with a long vowel 
sound and a final e, the final e is 
dropped before adding the ending –ing. 
 
Examples: 
bake – baked/baking 
shave  -  shaved/shaving 
Basic:  Have students 
write on cards base words 
to which inflectional 
endings can be added. 
Have students work in 
groups to sort the cards 
into two groups: words 
that require spelling 
changes when an 
inflectional ending is 
added and words that do 
not. Have them discuss 
reasons for their choices. 
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students participate in a 
Class Spelling Bee where 
they have to spell words 
that have inflectional 
endings added.

It is important when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at 
which you are reading, the rise and 
fall of your voice and expression. 
 
Rate – Refers to how fast or how 
slowly one speaks.  Be careful not to 
speak so slowly that listeners lose 
interest. Do not read too quickly, 
otherwise the words may not be 
clear and the listeners may find it 
difficult to follow. 
 
Intonation – The rise and fall of the 
voice to reflect what is happening in 
the reading piece. 
 
Vocal Expression – The tone of the 
reader should reflect the mood of 
the piece.  
Example 
Sad- Read slowly, lower the voice 
Angry – Loud, booming voice 
Happy – light,  
 
Pitch of Voice - Refers to the 
loudness or softness of the voice.

Story Elements 
Character: The people or animals in 
a story are the characters. When 
reading a story, you can discover 
what characters look like, what they 
think, how they feel and what they 
say and do. 
 
Stories can be told by either a 
character in the story or a witness 
who is not a character and is 
speaking about what happened. The 
point of view is about who is telling 
the story. 
  
Pronouns used by the narrator give 
clues to help the reader figure out 
‘who’ is telling the story.  
  
If the speaker is a character in the 
story,  words such as I, me, my, 
mine, we, and us are used. 
  
If the speaker is a witness to the 
story, words such as they, them, 
their, he, him, his, her, she, and it 
are used.                                        
                                                                  
Basic:  Have students 
identify character, setting 
and plot from familiar 
movies.  Discuss who is 
telling the story. 
  
Intermediate: Use a graphic 
organizer to have students 
identify the story elements in 
a familiar story.     
  
Advanced:  Read a story to 
the class.  Have students 
work in groups to complete a 
story tree. They should 
include: 
1. The name of the main  
    character. 
2. Two words that describe  
     the main character 
3. Three words to describe 
     the story setting 
4.  A sentence that tells what 
     the problem was 
5.  A sentence that tells the  
     solution 
Have students read a story 
and identify the elements 
of the story.

Plot: The plot has a beginning, 
middle, and end. It is usually made 
up of the most important part of the 
story. Short stories usually have one 
plot. 
 
Setting: When, where and the time 
of day that a story takes place is 
called the setting. The setting can be 
a real or a make-believe place.

Resources 
 
Context Clues are the words that surround 
an unfamiliar word that give clues about its 
meaning.  Context clues may be provided in 
the following ways: 
  
1. Examples – Clues about the meanings 
of a word can be found in the examples 
that are given following the unfamiliar 
words. The word is often followed by 
like, such as, for example and 
including.   
Example:  Primates, as monkeys and 
apes, are very interesting to observe. 
2. Synonyms – Words that mean the same 
or almost the same as an unfamiliar 
word.  
Example: The schooner or sailboat 
passed the cruise ship near the island of 
Bimini. 
3. Antonyms – Sometimes a context clue 
would contrast with a new word.   
Example:  Ashley was kind to the new 
boy, not hostile. 
Basic:  Have students 
select a word.  Have them 
provide clues (synonyms 
or antonyms for the word).  
Their classmates should 
try to guess the word. 
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students read sentences 
that provide example 
clues to the meanings of 
unfamiliar words.  Have 
students explain the 
meanings of these words. 
 
Advanced:  In groups of 
four, have students write 
definitions for given 
words.  They are not to 
use dictionaries, 
glossaries, Google, Siri or 
any other search engines. 
They are only allowed to 
use each other and the 
text in which the word 
appears. They must use 
context clues. 
 
Have students 
choose the word that 
means almost the 
same as the 
underlined word in 
sentences from a 
group of words.

When making predictions, think 
about clues the author has given 
along with what you already 
know, to make a good guess as 
to what will happen next. 
 
It will be necessary to make 
inferences and draw conclusions 
in order to make better 
predictions. 
 
Basic: Begin a simple science 
experiment.  Ask students to 
predict what they think will 
happen next.  Have students 
provide reasons for their 
predictions. Continue with the 
experiment.  Have students 
discuss whether or not their 
predictions were correct. 
 
Intermediate:  Refer students to 
previous stories of Bre Brookie

this information to make 
predictions about the behaviour of 
the characters as you read a new 
story together. 
 
Advanced:  As you read through 
a chapter book with students, 
have them review chapter titles 
and make predictions as to what 
they will be about.  Pause at 
various points when reading the 
story so that students can predict 
what will happen next.

When reading or writing paragraphs and 
stories, events must be placed in the 
correct order.  This helps the reader to 
follow the events in the story closely. In 
reading, this is referred to as the 
sequence of events. 
  
The sequence of events is also important 
when following directions to make 
something or to locate something. 
 
Clue words such as first, next, then, 
after that, and finally help readers 
understand the order in which certain 
events happened.   
  
Words such as morning, night and 
evening also tell the order in which 
events happened.   
  
Dates and time also assist with 
sequencing events. 
Basic:  Provide students with 
sentence strips that tell a 
story.  Have them arrange the 
sentences in order. Place 
numbers on the back of the 
sentence strips for self-
checking. This can also be 
done with the lines of a poem 
that has been read to them.

Make-believe or Fiction stories 
are created from the author’s 
imagination.  They are not true 
stories.  In many of these stories, 
animals take on the 
characteristics of humans.  The 
characters in the stories may also 
live in make-believe places.  
Some examples of fiction are 
mystery stories and fairy tales. 
   
Non-Fiction reading material 
include true facts about people, 
animals, events, things, and 
places.  Some examples of non-
fiction materials are biographies, 
autobiographies, newspaper 
articles, encyclopedias, blogs, 
information on school websites 
and text books. 
 
To figure out if a story is non-
fiction or fiction, begin by asking 
the question, “Could this happen 
in real life?”  
Basic:  Present students with 
a selection of books.  Have 
students sort them into two 
categories:  fiction and non-
fiction. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
listen to a fiction and a non-
fiction recording on the same 
topic. Have students describe 
similarities and differences 
between the two.  For 
example, one may have a 
more playful tone while the 
other is more serious or one 
has more sound effects than 
the other etc.    
  
Advanced: Have students 
work in groups to write a poem.  
Both poems would be on the 
same topic.  For example 
Frogs. Ask students to write 
both a fiction and a non-fiction 
poem on the topic.

A fact is a statement that can be 
proven true or false.  This may be 
done through further reading, 
observation or by asking an expert. 
Example: 
The Princess Margaret Hospital is 
located on Shirley Street. 
  
This can be proven by looking on a 
map or by actually visiting Shirley 
Street. 
  
An opinion is a statement that tells 
what someone is thinking or how the 
person feels about a particular thing.  
Opinions can change.  Opinions 
cannot be proven true or false 
because they are based on 
someone's thoughts, their feelings 
and their understanding.  Words that 
often provide clues that an opinion is 
being expressed are think, feel, 
believe, best, worst, etc.  
Example: 
I think Princess Margaret Hospital is 
the best hospital in New Providence. 
Basic:  Have students prepare 
paddles made from index cards 
and popsicle sticks. Have 
students place (F for fact on 
one side in one colour and O 
for opinion on the other side in 
a different colour). Read 
several statements to students.  
Have students decide if each 
statement read aloud is a fact 
or an opinion by displaying the 
appropriate side of the card. 
  
Intermediate:  Display a power 
point/chart of a passage on a 
topic that is being studied.  It

One thing may make another 
thing happen.  The reason why it 
happens is called the cause. The 
words “because”, “since” and 
“due to” may be used to signal a 
cause.  
 
What happens is called the 
effect. The words “therefore” 
and “as a result” may be used to 
signal an effect.    
 
A clue to finding a cause and 
effect relationship is to remember 
that the cause has to occur first 
(although it may not be the first 
thing mentioned).  The effect 
happens after.   
 
Basic:  Have students create 
posters displaying cause and effect 
situations. Have them write the 
cause and effect statement under 
the picture.  Example,  
Cause: picture of a sun 
Effect: picture of children in the  
            sea. 
Sentence: Because the sun was 
hot and humid, the children cooled 
off in the sea.” 
Intermediate:  Write Cause-and-
Effect relationship cards.  For 
example:  He doesn't get allowance 
this week (the effect) because he 
didn't do his chores (the cause). 
  
Using a cord, paper clips and a 
magnet, allow students to fish for 
matching pairs. 
  
Advanced: Read a story with the

When drawing a conclusion, 
readers use what they know 
and the facts presented to 
make sense of a story.  They 
must put all of this together 
along with the inferences they 
have made to make a decision 
or judgement.   
 
 
Basic:  Make a collection of familiar 
objects.  Select one object and put it 
in a shoe box.  Invite students to 
guess what is in the box by asking 
‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions.  Discuss the 
fact that they had to use the 
information that was being provided 
to draw conclusions about what is in 
the box. 
  
Intermediate: Have students read 
the beginning and the middle of a 
short story. Present them with two or 
three possible endings.  Ask them to 
select the best conclusion.  Have 
them give reasons for their 
decisions. 
  
Advanced: Show students a clip of 
a scene from a movie.  Have them 
tell their version of how it ends.  Ask 
students to explain how they came 
to their conclusions.  Let them 
compare their responses with the 
actual conclusion in the movie.

To make a judgment is to decide 
how good or bad, fair or unfair 
something is.  These decisions are 
based on facts presented as well as 
what is already known and the 
experiences and moral beliefs of the 
reader. 
 
When reading, judgments are made 
regarding the actions of characters. 
Decisions are made as to whether 
their actions were right or wrong, 
good or bad, wise or unwise based 
on the situations presented. 
Basic:  Present students 
with pictures of various 
vehicles. Highlight some of 
their features.  Present 
information about various 
families to students.  Based 
on the facts, have them 
decide which vehicle would 
best suit the need of each 
family.  Discuss their 
reasoning.  Relate this to the 
skill of making judgments. 
 
Intermediate:  Have 
students pretend to be a 
judge and rule on a case 
presented.  Have students 
discuss the judgement. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
read short biographies of 
certain athletes.  Have them 
make judgments about the 
athletes based on factual

Every cloud has a silver lining. 
Things may look bad initially, but it is 
possible for good things to come out 
of a bad situation. 
  
To plant corn by someone’s rain. 
It is not good to only depend on 
someone to get you through.  You

Good readers pay attention to whether 
the words or phrases in a text have a 
literal or a non-literal meaning.   
   
The literal meanings of words are the 
same as their definitions in a dictionary. 
The non-literal meaning of a phrase or 
words is something different altogether 
from what is being said. To tell the 
difference, ask: “Could this really 
happen, or does this make sense?”  
   
For example, take the phrase, “the Mall 
of Marathon is a zoo today”.  Is the 
author saying that animals were really 
kept in cages at the mall today? No, it 
has a non-literal meaning that the mall 
was as loud and crowded as a zoo 
would be.   
   
Similes and Metaphors are types of 
non-literal language. They both 
compare two seemingly unlike things so 
that a reader can get a better    
Picture of what is being described.   
 
Similes are phrases that begin with 
‘like’ or ‘as’.                                              
Basic:  Have students read a 
short paragraph containing 
simple metaphors and similes. 
Divide the paragraph into 
sentences and give each 
student two sentences: one 
with a figurative meaning and 
one with a literal meaning. 
Have students draw a picture 
showing what each sentence 
looks like if the meaning is 
taken literally. Using the 
drawings and the question 
“Does this make sense?”, let 
students decide if each 
sentence has a literal or a non-
literal meaning.   
   
Provide students with a 
scrambled set of figurative 
phrases and their meanings. 
Challenge students to match 
each correct meaning to its 
phrase. Incorporate the guiding 
questions for “Interpreting a 
Simile or Metaphor” to lead 
students to interpret the non-
literal sentences.  
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet where 
they must identify 
and explain 
figurative language 
in context.

Example:  “Her smile was as bright as

However, metaphors are phrases that 
do not use the words ‘like’ or ‘as’.  
   
Example:  “My life is a loopy 
rollercoaster ride.”  
   
When trying to interpret a simile or 
metaphor, a reader can ask:  
   
1. What two things are being 
compared?  
2. According to the author, what do   
     these two things have in common?  
3. What does the author want readers

described?

Handwriting can tell a lot about a person.  
Is this person neat, organized, and 
careful?  This means that it is important 
to pay careful attention to our 
handwriting. 
 
Ensure that the letters are of the 
appropriate size and height.  Leave 
sufficient space between words. 
 
When writing sentences on lined paper, 
ensure that the margins are observed.  
There is a left red margin and a right red 
margin. 
 
Unless you are writing a paragraph, 
begin the line of writing at the left margin 
and end it at the right margin.  Use 
syllabication rules to break up a word 
that may be too long to include without 
going over the right margin. 
 
When writing a paragraph, indent the first 
line.  This means that a space about the 
size of a “thumb” is left between the left 
margin and the start of your sentence.

The computer can be a useful tool when 
creating and printing reports, letters, 
invitations etc.  
 
Choosing a font that is easy to read, 
and is a reasonable size is very 
important. Font sizes between 12 and 
14 are acceptable sizes to use in 
documents such as reports.  
 
Font styles that can be used when 
creating reports or letters are: 
 Arial
 Times New Roman 
 Calibri 
 
Letters, reports and assignments should 
always be typed using a black font 
color. 
 
More creativity can be used when 
designing invitations, flyers, posters etc.  
Font sizes can be bigger and letters can 
be bolder and colourful in order to 
emphasize important information.  The 
fonts used can be more of a fun style.    
 
Party Invitations: 
 Jokerman 
 Arial Round

sentence using the 
chosen font.  Discuss 
legibility and whether or 
not it is appropriate for 
certain pieces of writing.

the Latin alphabet. 
 
I = 1 
V = 5 
X =10  
 
In order to represent some numerals 
a combination of symbols is used.

Commas are used to separate words 
in a series, when writing dates and 
also to separate who is speaking from 
what is being said.  When writing a 
comma, begin just above the bottom 
line with a dot; move up, around and 
slant down slightly below the bottom 
line.  
  
Quotation marks are used to 
indicate the words that are being 
spoken.  One is placed at the 
beginning of the words that are being 
spoken and the other one at the end.   
When writing quotation marks, begin 
below the top line with a dot; up,

A sentence is a group of words that 
expresses a complete idea or 
thought.    
 
Example: “They rode the bus to 
school.”  
 
Sentences should begin with a 
capital letter and end with an end 
mark. There are three different end 
marks: period (.), question mark (?) 
and exclamation point/mark (!). 
 
A fragment is a phrase or group of 
words that may be capitalized and 
punctuated like a sentence, but 
does not express a complete 
thought. 
 
Example: “The big game.” 
 
Basic:  Using flash cards, have 
students categorize groups of 
words as sentences or 
fragments.

There are four types of 
sentences. 
Declarative sentences make a 
statement. This type of sentence 
ends with a period (.).    
Interrogative sentences ask 
questions. These types of 
sentences end with a question

A run-on sentence is made 
up of two or more sentences 
that have been joined 
incorrectly. They can 
sometimes go on and on.  
 
Example:  “Our beaches are 
lovely people litter them with 
food containers.”     
 
A Run-on sentence can be 
corrected by placing a comma 
and a conjunction between 
the sentences. 
 
Example:  “Our beaches are 
lovely, but people litter them 
with food containers.” 
 
Another way to correct a run-
on sentence is to separate 
them into two different 
sentences.   
 
Example:  “Our beaches are 
lovely.  People litter them with 
food containers.”   
  
 
Basic: Students will participate in 
the exercise called “Break It Up” 
where they will correct run-on 
sentences.  Give each group of 
students a set of run-on sentences 
on sentence strips.  Tell students 
when to begin, then allow them to 
cut or tear each strip at the proper 
place to form two sentences.  Once 
they are done, they must use a 
marker to put in the punctuation and 
capital letter.

Resources 
 
Nouns are words that name a 
person, place, animal, thing or idea. 
Nouns can be divided into common 
nouns and proper nouns.   
 
Common nouns do not name a 
particular person, place, animal, thing 
or idea. They are usually not 
capitalized unless they begin a 
sentence or are part of a title. 
 
Example:    
Person:   police 
Place:      downtown 
Animal:   dog          
Thing:     building 
Idea:       fear 
 
A proper noun names a particular 
person, place or thing and begins 
with a capital letter. Days of the week, 
months of the year and holidays are 
proper nouns. 
 
Example: 
Person:   Sgt. Rolle 
Place:      Bay Street 
Animal:   Geronimo           
Thing:     Police Station 
Basic:  Separate the class 
into two teams. Have each 
team search for nouns 
beginning with a given 
letter within a 30 second 
time frame. The first team 
with the most nouns wins. 
 
Intermediate:  Give 
students a list of nouns on 
word cards.   Have them 
work with a partner to 
classify each one under the 
correct headings of -
Person, Place, Thing, 
Animal & Idea.  Then have 
students write specific 
names for each one.    
 
Advanced:  Have students 
work in groups of four to 
identify nouns in a 
paragraph. Have them 
state if they are common or 
proper nouns.   
Have students write 
sentences about their 
community using at least 
three common and three 
proper nouns.  Have them 
circle the common nouns 
and underline the proper 
nouns.

subject pronouns.  
 
The subject pronouns are:  I, you, he, 
she, it, we and they. 
Example: 
“Jan is a good runner.” 
“She is a good runner. 
 
When talking about you and another 
person, always put yourself second. 
Example:   
“Jan and I are good runners.” 
 
Some pronouns are used as the object of 
a verb or as the object of a 
preposition. They are called object 
pronouns. 
 
The object pronouns are:   me, you, 
him, her, it, us and them. 
Example: 
“Stop following us.” 
“Come stay over by me.” 
Basic:  Have students circle 
the pronouns in sentences. 
 
Intermediate:  Present 
students with simple 
sentences.  Have them 
rewrite sentences using 
appropriate pronouns. 
 
Example:  
“Sam has a little brown 
dog.”    
“He has a little brown dog.”  
 
Advanced:  Have students 
rewrite sentences where 
they substitute the nouns for 
pronouns.  Have them draw 
a line under each personal 
pronoun and label them with 
“S” for subject pronouns or 
“O” for object pronouns.  
 
 
 
Have students choose 
pronouns from a word 
bank to replace 
underlined nouns in 
sentences

groups.  Give each group of 
students two sets of cards: one 
with pictures of various nouns and 
the other with possessive 
pronouns.  Have students take 
turns choosing a card from each 
set.  They must then use the noun 
and possessive pronoun in a 
sentence.  Have students record 
the sentences that their group 
composes.

Verbs can be used to tell when 
something happens. The action can 
happen in the present, past or the 
future.  
Present tense expresses an action 
or situation that is happening now.

car to school.”  
When using the pronouns he, she 
and it add an “s” to the verb to 
indicate the present tense.  
Example: “It moves slowly.” 
If the noun is plural, no “s” is added 
to the verb.      
Example: “The men work on the 
building.”

A sentence has two parts: the 
subject and the predicate. 
 
The subject is the main noun or 
pronoun in the sentence. It tells 
who or what the sentence is about.  
  
Example: 
“The children study hard every 
day.” 
 
Who studies hard every day?  The 
children do. 
 
The sentence is about the children.  
 
A predicate is the verb that tells 
about the subject. It can tell what the 
subject is or what it is doing. 
 
Example:   
“The children study hard every 
day.” 
 
The children do what? They study 
hard every day.

A sentence has two parts, the 
subject and the predicate.  
 
The subject of a sentence tells who 
or what the sentence is about.  The 
simple subject is the main word or 
noun in the complete subject. 
 
Example:  His big sister is a 
celebrity.  
 
“His big sister” is the complete 
subject. 
 
What is the key word in the 
complete subject that the sentence 
is all about?  sister.  
 
“Sister” is the simple subject. 
 
The predicate of a sentence tells 
about the subject.  The simple 
predicate is the main word or verb 
in a complete predicate.  
 
Example:  Her big sister is a 
celebrity.  “Is a celebrity” is the 
complete predicate.  What is the 
main verb in the predicate?  is  
“Is” is the simple predicate.

An adjective is a word that 
describes a noun or a pronoun.  It 
can tell “what kind”, “which one” 
or “how many”. 
 
Sensory Adjectives 
Adjectives that tell how things look, 
taste, feel, sound and smell. These 
are called sensory adjectives.  
Examples:  peppery, crunchy, 
salty, bumpy, slimy, lumpy, 
quiet, noisy, enormous, small, 
fresh, smelly etc.  
 
Adjectives that Compare: 
Adjectives can also be used to 
compare two nouns. The ending 
“er” is added to the adjective to 
show the difference.  
Example:  Peter sings louder than 
Paul. 
 
Adjectives can also be used to 
compare more than two nouns. 
The ending –est is added to the 
adjective to show the difference.  
Example:  Jack sings the loudest 
in the choir.

 An adverb tells more about a verb, 
adjective or another adverb. 
Adverbs answer the questions how, 
when or where. Most adverbs end 
with “ly”. However, there are some 
adverbs that do not end in “ly”. 
 
Some adverbs are:

very           hard        twice 
calmly       strictly      rapidly     
suddenly   usually     swiftly 
 
 
The word too is an adverb. It is used 
to describe something that goes over 
the desired amount.  It can also mean 
“also”.   
Example:   I ate too much food. 
                  She had an apple too.  
 
Some adverbs are used to compare. 
We use “er” to compare two things 
and “est” to compare more than two 
things.   
 
fast      faster       fastest   
slow    slower      slowest

A preposition is a word that tells 
location, direction and time. It can also 
show the relationship between words in 
a sentence. 
 
Some words that tell direction and  
location are:  over, up, under, after, 
behind,  before, near, by, around, 
inside, outside, up, down, in, on, 
across, above and through 
 
Words that tell time: 
until, during and often  
 
Words that show relationship: 
at, by, to, for, of, off and with  
 
A prepositional phrase is made up of a 
preposition, the object of the preposition 
and any word in between. 
 
Example:  across the park 
“Across” is the preposition and “park” is 
the object of the preposition. 
 
Prepositional phrases help to make our 
writing more interesting as they help to 
give more details.  
Example: “John ran quickly.” 
“John ran quickly across the park and 
jumped over the fence.” 
 
Basic:  Have students work

correct preposition word 
card to complete the 
sentences given.

A simple sentence has a 
subject and a verb and 
expresses a complete 
thought.  
Example:                       
“Kayla ate too many hog 
plums.”  
A compound sentence is 
a sentence made up of two 
or more simple 
sentences. The sentences 
can be connected by a 
comma (,) and the words 
and, or, or but. 
 
Example: 
“Kayla ate too many hog-
plums.” 
“Now she has a tummy 
ache.” 
 
“Kayla ate too many hog-
plums, and now she has a 
tummy ache.”

Good writers use time-order 
words to show readers the 
order of steps or events. Some 
time-order words are first, 
next, then, later, now, 
tomorrow and last.   
 
When explaining how to do or 
find something, put instructions 
in order and use time-order 
words.   
 
Before Words:  Earlier, firstly, 
In the past, 
 
Words that Show First: 
Originally, In the first place, 
soon after and to begin 
 
Words that Show Next: 
Not long after, as soon as, 
tomorrow and second 
 
Words that Show Last: 
At last, after a long time and 
lastly 
 
 
Basic:  Instruct students to reorder a 
set of sentence strips to show what 
happened first, then, next and finally.  
Have them put the appropriate 
transition word card on the lines at the 
beginning of each sentence. 
 
Example:   “Going to the Beach” 
_____  We arrived at the beach. 
_____  Put on our swimsuits. 
_____  We all got into the car. 
_____  We jumped into the water.  
 
Intermediate:  Give each group of 
students a copy of a paragraph with 
the transition words omitted.  Tell 
them that they must race against each 
other to be the first group to correctly 
insert the transitions that could link the 
sentences.    
Example: 
“Enjoying A Succulent Pineapple” 
We drove into Gregory Town to visit 
Darville’s Pineapple Farm.  They gave 
us a succulent pineapple.  ______ we 
peeled the pineapple.  ______ we 
sliced it into several pieces.  ______ 
we distributed it among the group.  
______ we had a great feast!

A paragraph is a group of 
sentences about the same 
idea. The main idea of a 
paragraph is what the 
paragraph is about.  The main 
idea is often relayed in the 
topic sentence which is 
usually the first sentence in 
the paragraph and is 
indented.  
 
Other sentences tell more 
about the main idea and are 
called supporting details.  
The last sentence in a 
paragraph should tie the 
supporting sentences 
together. It is called the 
concluding sentence.  
 
When writing a composition or 
an essay, you may have at 
least three paragraphs.  Each 
paragraph should speak 
about the one main idea and 
include supporting details. 
 
Basic:   Present students with a 
paragraph. Have students circle the 
topic sentence and underline at least 
three supporting details. 
 
Intermediate:   Show students a 
picture of a refrigerator. Have them 
discuss the importance of having a 
fridge and consider what life would be 
like if refrigerators never existed. 
Record their ideas on the board.  
Have students formulate a topic 
sentence for a paragraph about the 
fridge entitled, “The Useful Machine”.  
Write the paragraph together. 
 
Advanced:   Have students conduct a 
poll of the class using an on-line 
survey to determine which house-hold 
appliance students think is most 
convenient - a washing machine, 
dishwasher, refrigerator or stove.  
Have students justify their personal 
choice in three well-developed 
paragraphs.  Have students use a 
graphic organizer to plan their ideas.  
The piece could be titled, “The Best 
Appliance Ever.” 
 
Have students write 
about the house hold 
appliance that they 
deem least useful. 
Students should 
express reasons why 
the item is less useful 
than others.

Everyone has a different style of 
writing.  Voice refers to how much 
of the writer can be felt in a piece.  
Does the writer believe what is 
being written?  Is the writer really 
interested in what is being written? 
Can you get a feel for the writer’s 
personality? 
 
The writer’s voice comes through 
in the tone and mood of a piece.  
Tone refers to the feeling that an 
author creates.  Is the piece 
serious? playful? angry? etc.  
 
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the piece.  
Is the reader happy? sad? fearful?  
It is important that the tone 
matches the messages that the 
writer is trying to send.  If the 
subject is serious for example, the 
language should not be light or 
funny. 
 
Basic: Read snippets of 
different students’ writing in 
the class.  Using the voice of 
the piece, have students try to 
match the writing pieces with 
the classmates that wrote 
them. 
 
Intermediate:   Have 
students view television 
commercials.  Have them 
discuss the varying moods 
and their effectiveness. 
   
Advanced:  Distribute flash 
cards with “mood voices”. 
Have students with the card 
come to the front of the class 
one at a time and talk in that 
voice for 20 seconds. When 
the time is up, ask students 
what kind of voice was used. 
Have students select a mood 
and write a piece portraying 
that mood. 
 
 
 
Present students with 
emotion cards/emojis or 
pictures. Have them write 
a paragraph using 
language to depict the 
selected mood and tone. 
Have them use ‘the

When writing, choose a viewpoint 
from which to write and stick with it. 
 
First Person – When telling your 
personal story use pronouns like I, 
me, my, mine, myself and we. 
Connect with the readers by telling 
them your personal thoughts and 
experiences.  You are telling the 
story only from your perspective. 
 
Second Person – When writing 
from the perspective of someone 
who is watching what is happening, 
use pronouns like you and yours. 
 
Third Person – From this viewpoint 
you are the person who is looking 
on.  Use pronouns like he, she, it 
and they.  From this perspective you 
get to experience the thoughts of the 
characters. 
 
Personification - This is when an 
animal or object behaves like a 
human.  They may speak or move, 
share emotions etc.

two groups.  Show one group a 
picture of the Glass Window 
Bridge from the ground level.  
Show the other group a view of 
it from above.  Explain to them 
that the pictures were of the

Poems may rhyme or not rhyme.  
Rhymes usually occur at the end of 
lines.  
 
Rhythm is the beat or series of 
stressed or unstressed syllable (word 
part) in a poem. Poems have specific 
rhyme schemes. A rhyme scheme is 
noted by the letters of the alphabet, 
beginning with the letter ‘a’. The word 
at the end of the first line will be noted 
as ‘a’. Every line after that, that ends 
with the same rhyming sound will be 
noted as ‘a’. The next line having a 
different rhyming sound at the end 
that is different from ‘a’, will then be 
noted as ‘b’ and so on.  
 
Limerick 
The limerick is a very funny poem 
that follows the rhyme pattern of 
aabba (as explained above). 
 
Cinquain 
This is a poem with five lines.  There 
are several different forms.  They can 
be rhymed or unrhymed.  They often 
describe a person, place or thing.  
 
Basic: Take students on a 
rhyme hunt. Give each group an 
object (coconut, shell, cent, fish, 
beach sand, etc). Tape rhyming 
words to chalkboard. Allow 
different members of each team 
to select the words that rhyme 
with their objects. At the end of 
three minutes allow groups to 
organize and share their 
rhyming words.  Have students 
use the rhyming words to create 
a limerick. 
  
Intermediate: Provide students

Assessment 
Resources 
 
In order to provide more vivid details, 
authors often include dialogue in their 
writing.  A dialogue is a conversation 
between two or more people. 
 
In a movie the camera may switch from 
character to character so that the audience 
can see who is speaking.  When writing, 
there is a special way of identifying who is 
speaking and the words that are being 
spoken. 
 
Commas are used to separate who is 
speaking from what is being said.   
 
Quotation marks are used to indicate the 
exact words that are being spoken.  One is 
placed at the beginning of the words that 
are being spoken and the other one at the 
end.  They usually follow a comma unless 
they begin the sentence.  The first word in 
a quote should be capitalized. 
 
Example:  Keith said, “Wipe your mouth.” 
                “Wipe your mouth,” Keith said. 
 
Avoid overusing “said” in your writing.  
Include words that help to express the 
mood more clearly such as screamed, 
whispered, exclaimed, laughed etc. 
Basic:   Write a sentence on a 
sentence strip that contains 
dialogue.  Separate each word.  
Make a cut-out of a comma and 
beginning and ending quotation 
marks.  Give each student a 
word from the sentence and have 
them stand in front of the class.  
Have students first put the 
sentence in an order that makes 
sense. Then have the students 
with the punctuation marks insert 
them where they should go. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with a scenario and have them 
write two sentences of a fitting 
dialogue.  
 
Advanced:  Have students 
watch a clip from a favourite 
show.  Turn on the closed 
caption and freeze the frames in 
succession.  Have students 
identify different lines that the 
characters said.  In small groups 
have students work together to 
write the dialogue. 
Have students 
listen to a 
conversation 
between two 
friends.  Ask 
them to compose 
their own version 
of the 
conversation 
being sure to 
report on who 
said what.

Narrative writing tells a story or part 
of a story.  A narrative should have a 
beginning, middle and end and 
should include characters, setting 
and a well-developed plot. 
 
Characters are animals or people in 
a story.   
 
The setting is the place where the 
story takes place.  Time should be 
taken to use the senses to tell what 
can be seen, heard, felt, tasted or 
smelled.   
 
In the middle of the writing, time 
should be taken to develop the plot.  
The plot tells what the problem in 
the story is and how it is resolved.  
This is the time to use action and 
dialogue to provide information 
about the characters. 
 
The end of the story or conclusion 
wraps everything up. 
 
Basic:  Have students spend 
time developing the 
characters in their stories. 
Have them create a Wanted 
Poster for their characters that 
would give details on their hair 
colour, eye colour, height, 
skin complexion etc.  Adjust it

A descriptive essay is a group of 
paragraphs that can describe a 
particular person, place or an event.  
The details are presented in such a 
way that it makes it easy for the 
reader to visualize what the writer is 
describing.  Authors use sensory 
words, similes and metaphors to 
make their writing come alive. 
 
Sensory words are focused on the 
senses:  smell, taste, see, touch 
and hear. 
 
Similes are phrases that begin with 
like or as and are used to compare 
two unlike things. 
 
Example:  “Her dress was as 
colourful as a rainbow.” 
 
Metaphors are also used to 
compare. They do not use like or 
as. 
 
Example:  “The clouds were huge 
cotton balls in the sky.”

and friends information about what is 
happening in our lives.  Friendly letters should 
include:  
 
The heading - This includes the date. It is 
normally written in the right-hand corner and 
tells when the letter was written.  
 
Salutation or Greeting - This is the way to 
identify who you are writing to.  It appears a 
few spaces below the date next to the left hand 
column.  It usually begins with “Dear”.  
 
The body of the letter – This is considered 
the main part of the letter where you may 
include all of the interesting details about your 
family and friends and what you have been 
doing, your hobbies etc.   
 
 The Closing – This is a way of ending the 
letter or signing off.  “Love” and “Your best 
friend” are examples that are used.  The first 
word in the closing is always capitalized. This 
is normally written on the right hand side of the 
letter a few spaces under the body of the letter. 
 
Signature – This identifies by name the 
person who is writing the letter.

The Reading Block 
 
 
 
The Reading Block for lower primary refers to the 90-minute double period dedicated exclusively for the teaching of reading from 
9:10 a.m. – 10:40 a.m. each morning.  This daily instructional block encourages the integration of the five components of reading 
(phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension).  Within this block, time should be allocated for guided 
reading where teachers hear students read in small groups as well as individually.   
 
Useful Information about the Teaching of Reading 
 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate. 
 
 
 
Basal Readers 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-leveled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach (reading 
for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate reading 
material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension skills and 
vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 


189 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
  
The Language Experience Approach 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This approach 
can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an experience for 
students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the board or on chart 
paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the language arts components 
(speaking, listening, writing and reading) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading refers to teachers working with students in small groups to provide support in reading and comprehending 
designated texts.     
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teachers’ observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read orally. 
The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps the 
teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 


190 
Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings in relation to the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, science 
and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, the more demand for reading 
skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  Lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ ability and interests and be ready to help students find the right books at the right 
time.  Learning Students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can be 
found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage students to 
visit their school libraries.

Important Phonics Rules 
  
 
1. C has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /k/ or /s/.  It is pronounced /k/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in words like 
‘can’, ‘cough’ and ‘cut’.  C makes its soft sound /s/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘cent’, ‘city’ and 
‘cycle’. 
 
2. G has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /g/ or /j/.  It makes its hard sound /g/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in 
words like ‘gate’, ‘goat’ or ‘got’.  G makes its soft sound /j/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘gem’, ‘gills’ or 
‘gym’.  There are some exceptions to this rule as in words like ‘get’, ‘give’ and ‘gift’. 
 
3. The CVC pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel and then another consonant.  When this 
happens, the vowel usually gives its shorts sound.  Examples are words like ‘bed’, ‘man’ and ‘hat’.  
 
4. The Final E or CVCE pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel, another consonant and a final 
e.  In instances where this occurs, the first vowel gives its long sound (says its name) and the e is silent.  Examples of 
words that follow this pattern are ‘made’, ‘home’, ‘cute’ and ‘date’. 
 
5. The CV pattern refers to words that only have one-syllable.  In these two-letter words, the vowel normally gives its long 
sound as in words like ‘go’ and ‘me’.  Some one-syllable words do not follow this pattern as in words like ‘to’ and ‘do’. 
 
6. R-Controlled vowels refer to vowels that are followed by the letter r.  When this happens, the sound of the r usually 
dominates the vowel sound, and the sound that the vowel makes is neither a short or a long sound.  Words like ‘cart’, ‘far’ 
and ‘for’ are examples of the r-controlled sounds. 
 
7. When gh follows i, the i gives its long sound and the gh is silent.  ‘High’ and ‘night’ are examples of this rule. 
 
8. In words that begin with kn and wr, only the sound for the second letter is heard.  In the words ‘knot’ and ‘wreck’ the n 
and r sounds are heard.

Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 3 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027 
Vowel Generalizations 
 
The following are some of the most common vowel generalizations. 
 
a. In one syllable words containing two vowel letters (one of which is a final e) the first vowel usually represents a long vowel 
sound, the e is silent. (e.g. kite, bite). 
b. In a one-syllable word that ends with a vowel, the vowel that follows the consonant is usually long (e.g. he, go – open 
syllable). 
c. A vowel is usually short when it appears between two consonants in a one-syllable word (e.g. hat, fox, dig – closed 
syllable). 
d. When i is followed by gh, nd,  or ld, the i usually represents its long sound (e.g. find, child, light). 
e. The vowel o followed by –ld usually has a long sound (e.g. old).  
f. If the only vowel in a word or syllable is an a followed by w, ll and u, the sound of the a is usually that of a short o (e.g. 
wall).  
g. When two vowels appear together in a word, the first vowel usually gives its long sound and the vowel that follows is silent. 
This rule is usually consistent with ai, oa, ee and ay combinations. 
h. Each vowel letter may represent the soft schwa sound often heard in the unaccented syllable (e.g. disappear, telegram). 
i. Y functions as a vowel when it concludes words of more than one syllable (e.g. dad/dy) and it follows a vowel (e.g. day).

Writing Instruction 
 
Daily Written Composition 
The timetable for the Lower Primary Grades provides daily periods for Written Composition instruction with a total of five (5) periods 
weekly.  In some instances, a daily allotment of 30 minutes for written composition may not be feasible; hence, the time allotment for 
instruction is five periods per week.  It is recommended based on research and best practices that composition writing should follow 
a balanced literacy approach.    
 
Instructional Strategy: 10 Day Writing Plan   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
“A Ten Day Writing Plan” is a pilot writing model developed to support the daily teaching of written composition. This plan can be 
adapted for use at all primary grades This Plan is research based and contains the following components of good writing instruction: 
· Mentor Texts 
· Providing Enriching Experiences to Build Background Knowledge 
· Vocabulary Building Activities 
· The Writing Process 
· Writing Instructional Strategies 
- Modeled Writing 
- Interactive Writing

rocky and sandy 
shores.  
 
Ask guiding 
questions: 
 What colour was 
the sand? 
 How did the 
waves move? 
 What was visible 
on the shore? 
 How did the 
sand/rock feel? 
 How did it smell? 
 
Teacher should 
encourage students to use 
descriptive terms in their 
responses and should 
record the same. For 
example: the gritty sand, 
black sticky tar, sharp 
rocks
