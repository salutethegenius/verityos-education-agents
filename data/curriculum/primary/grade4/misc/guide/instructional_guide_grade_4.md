PREFACE 
 
 
Several strategies were employed to assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum.  The process began 
with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions. These countries included Jamaica, the 
United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois), Canada, and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 guides). The 
documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their rationale and 
philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as well as the Scope of 
Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa and several other countries 
were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of English and the Ministry of 
Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.  
 
Opportunities were also provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers throughout The 
Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted to be included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen (116) teachers 
throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students to get their feedback on what 
they wanted to learn about and the types of learning activities they enjoyed.  Additionally, a focus group was conducted with 
members of the community that included business owners, parents, and those who interact with students in after-school clubs 
and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary teachers, one preschool teacher, and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment Section.  
Opportunities were also provided for several Family Island teachers to submit content and activities through the Education 
Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time engaged in 
research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction to meet the needs of their students.

BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student-centered; 
2. At each grade level, students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason, and make decisions as well as develop self-confidence 
and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme and 
should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms, which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing sixth 
grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our students 
receive at the primary level lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that students can 
take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on communication skills.  During this period in our history, knowledge of basic communication skills is 
essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and more people are being 
pushed to use online services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct banking transactions, to pay bills, 
to make travel arrangements, to access government services, and so much more.   Additionally, changes in technology 
demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Landlines, that only required listening and speaking 
skills  to use, have been replaced with smartphones and computers that allow us to communicate via WhatsApp, update our 
statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read the information on the internet, buy tickets, post to social media create blogs, 
conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the world, and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new 
ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be confidence that our education system will prepare students 
to communicate effectively despite the changes that occur.  Recognizing that Language Arts skills are the foundation of all 
learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on producing students who are not 
only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability to communicate effectively in a rapidly 
advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves creatively, collaborate, and problem solve as 
we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education 
for all…”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of Oracy, Reading, and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their 
hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that they will need to become lifelong learners and to navigate successfully 
in an ever-changing world.

1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, teachers 
should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area subjects 
and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual field trips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centres, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level to provide teachers and parents with a guide for what 
students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This information should be 
used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also indicates the level 
of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become proficient in a particular area, 
teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted to make 
them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the end of the course of 
study.  Teachers should be guided by the content, which indicates what students should know or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading (Phonemic 
Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar, and Written 
Composition). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds on the 
previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided into three 
categories:  basic, intermediate, and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can access content 
and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to meet the needs of their students.   
 


 
25 
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of opportunities 
should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with various audiences.  
They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large group settings.  ZOOM, 
TEAMS, and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative projects to be organized with 
students in other schools, districts, islands, and other countries once the necessary safety protocols have been put in 
place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with students.  
Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  To avoid duplication in the 
curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best applied.  It is expected that 
once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the strands and that they can be 
assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This particularly refers to 
reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be highlighted.  Students are to be 
exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are taught through teacher read-alouds and 
independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade level. 
 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales, and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics, and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels, and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading, and after reading. 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening 
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in reading still have opportunities to 


 
26 
 
understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (using pictures, video clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio 
clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions as students connect skills to their everyday 
experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing if 
students have mastered the skill is to have them incorporate it into a writing exercise.  This will allow them to apply what 
they have learned.  Students who can apply reading skills would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  
Following this method of teaching comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated 
into the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling, and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as ends 
in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting; 
however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in the case of 
Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should only be scored for 
what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week, the number of items on the checklist 
should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the checklist should be continually 
reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been generated.  Students should be aware 
of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to assess their writing before it is even 
submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, mechanics, and handwriting/presentation. 
Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three lines until their fine motor skills are more developed 
and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of grade two, cursive handwriting can be introduced if 
students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, and 
words from the grade-level word list included in the appendices of this document.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Standard English is a term applied to 
a language that is grammatically 
correct with no dialect. It 
encompasses grammar, vocabulary, 
pronunciation, and spelling. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can 
interfere with good communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class 
or with a more formal audience.   
Other occasions could be when 
conducting a class assembly, 
participating in a Christmas play etc. 
 
The Bahamian dialect can be used 
when speaking in more informal 
settings, like with family or friends.  It 
has its special vocabulary as well as a 
specific way of pronouncing words. 
It includes words like: 
 
callin’= calling 
bey = boy 
tink = think  
dis = this 
 
In addition to being used in informal 
conversations, Bahamian dialect is 
often featured in plays, Bahamian 
novels as well as radio and 
television commercials. 
Basic:  Call the names of various 
people.  Have students discuss 
whether it would be appropriate to 
use dialect or Standard English if 
they had to speak to them.  
 
Examples: The Prime Minister, 
first cousin, a cashier, a tourist, 
packing boy, the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge etc. 
 
Intermediate:  Students will 
pretend that their favourite 
television star will be visiting their 
school.  Have them develop 
appropriate questions in Standard 
English that will be asked.  
 
Advanced:  Have students listen 
to a Bahamian commercial in 
dialect.  Have students translate 
parts of it into Standard English for 
a non-Bahamian audience.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
When speaking, consideration must be 
given to the audience, occasion, and 
location. Sometimes, adjustments have 
to be made to our regular speech. 
 
Volume refers to the loudness or 
softness of the speaker’s voice. Be 
aware of the environment and adjust 
the volume of speech accordingly. 
 
Examples: 
Danger – very loud 
Social/party – loud 
In Class – medium loud/soft/silent 
(depending on the activity) 
 
Rate means how fast or how slowly the 
person is speaking.  The rate can vary 
depending on the occasion. 
 
When speaking ordinarily, speak at a 
pace where people can comfortably 
understand what is being said.  If the 
person speaks too quickly, key 
information may be missed.  If the 
person speaks too slowly, the listeners 
might lose interest.  When speaking for 
dramatic purposes, the pace of 
speaking can sometimes fluctuate with 
the mood of the piece. 
Basic:  Read sentences void of 
intonations. Have students 
determine whether the sentences 
are statements or questions.  
Discuss the importance of 
intonations. 
 
Intermediate:  Have selected 
students read short paragraphs that 
would involve the use of 
expressions.  Encourage the class 
to watch students to determine how 
the paragraph that was read, made 
them feel.  Discuss what the 
readers did to portray those 
emotions.

turns giving a tour of the campus to 
parents.  Have students incorporate 
what they have learned to make the 
tour interesting.  Discuss.

Pronunciation – This refers to the 
correctness of sound in a word.  When 
speaking formally, ensure that sounds 
like the following are said correctly: 
 Words beginning with th. 
 Endings of words with ing and s. 
 
Use tongue, teeth, and lips to produce 
the correct sounds.   
 
Facial expressions and gestures are 
a form of non-verbal communication 
that help to convey the emotions of the 
speaker.  
Example:  If happy news is being 
delivered, the speaker might wear a

If the listener wanted to show how big 
something was, they may spread their 
arms apart to demonstrate this.

Facial expressions and gestures can 
help to keep the listeners engaged.  
However, they should not be overused 
as they can also distract. 
 
Pitch refers to how high or how low the 
person is speaking.  Some people 
normally may have high-pitched voices 
while others may have low-pitched 
voices.  When completing dramatic 
activities, the speaker may vary the 
pitch depending on who is speaking. 
 
Example: baby- high squeaky voice 
 
Intonation refers to the rising and 
falling of the voice.  The voice may rise 
or fall if a question is being asked or 
demand is being made.  The intonation 
may vary depending on the purpose of 
the statement.  A person speaking in a 
monotone does not have the rhythmic 
rise and fall of the voice.  There is only 
one tone being used. 
 
Pause – Sometimes speakers pause 
to conclude a point, for emphasis, to 
get the audience’s attention, and to 
allow the audience time to think about 
what has transpired.

A syllable is a unit of pronunciation. It is 
a word or part of a word with a single 
vowel sound. The number of syllables in 
a word is determined by the number of 
vowel sounds. Words can be divided 
into syllables.   
  
Syllabication helps in:   
a. Decoding words  
b. Reading fluently   
c. Spelling words accurately   
d. Dividing words at the end of a line 
    when writing   
 
Example: The word “turtle” would be 
divided into “tur-tle” and not “tu-
rtle” or “turt-le”.

cards. In groups, they will cut the 
words into syllables, mix up the 
syllables and then try to put the 
words back together again. They 
will then try to match each of the 
syllabication rules to the word that 
follows the rule. Example: care/ful 
 
Technology Adaptation:   
Teachers can write words on the 
Whiteboard video conferencing 
tool or whiteboard.fi and allow

Objective 2.21: Decode words with final /l/ spelt ‘al’, ‘el’ and ‘le’. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The /l/ sound at the end of a word can  
be spelt in several different ways.  
  
Generally, “al” is used when adding a  
suffix on to a base word.     
 
Example: logic - logical  
  
Sample Words  
identical         critical  
hospital          official  
personal         magical  
natural  
  
Use “le” if the sound is part of the word.  A 
consonant normally forms a part of this 
end syllable.  The “le” ending is seen 
mainly after the following letters: b, c, d, 
f, g, k, p, sl, st, t and z.  The le ending is 
never used after these letters: m, n, r, v, 
and w.  
  
Sample Words: 
ble – Bible, cable, grumble  
cle – circle, icicle, muscle  
dle – handle, middle, needle   
fle – raffle, trifle, waffle 
gle – giggle, triangle, single  
kle – buckle, tackle, trickle,    
Basic:  Have students

The letter combinations “dge” and 
“ge” make the /j/ sound.  The letter 
combination “dge” is 
a trigraph because the three letters 
always function together to form the 
same sound as the letter “j”.  Use 
“dge” with words that have a short 
vowel sound before the /j/ sound.  
Examples:  
“judge” and “edge”   
  
Use “ge” with words that do not 
have a short vowel sound before 
the /j/ sound.  
Examples: 
“change” and “huge”

are spelt correctly and incorrectly.  
Label them “A” and “B”.  Display 
each pair of word cards and allow

Diphthongs are types of vowels 
where two vowel sounds are 
connected in a continuous, gliding 
motion (to make one sound). They are 
often referred to as gliding vowels.  
   
Examples of diphthongs are: /oi/, 
/oy/, /ow/, /ou/.  
  
The diphthongs ‘ou’ and ‘ow’ can have 
two distinct sounds.   
 
 /ou/ can sound like ‘ou’ as in 
‘house’, and like ‘ou’ as in ‘soup’.  
 /ow/ can sound like ‘ow’ as in 
clown and ‘ow’ as in glow.

An abbreviation is a shortened form 
of a word that ends with a period.   
  
In abbreviations, you will notice 
that:   
  
1. Most are spelt with the first  
    letters of the word(s).  
    Example:  company – co. 
 
2. Some are spelt with a  
    combination of letters from the  
    word.   
    Example: government – govt. 
  
3. Others are spelt with letters not  
    found in the original word.  
    Example:  ounce – oz. 
  
4. Many abbreviations begin with a  
    capital letter.  
    Example:  Florida – Fl. 
 
5. Some abbreviations that include  
    unit of measurements or capital  
    letters do not need a period.  
    Example:  meter - m

Words often contain base words.  A 
base word is the part of a word that 
can stand alone and has meaning.  It 
is the simplest form of a word.  
  
Example: “Cycle” is a base word that 
means “wheel”.  
   
Prefixes and suffixes can be added to 
base words to change the meanings 
of these words.  
  
Prefix – A prefix is a word or syllable 
that is added at the beginning of a 
base word.    
  
Prefixes have their special meanings 
too.  
  
Examples:  
The prefix “bi” means “two”.  
The prefix “tri” means “three”.  
  
The word “bicycle” means a “cycle 
having two wheels”.  
  
A “tricycle” means a “cycle having 
three wheels”.  
Adding “bi” and “tri” to the word 
Basic:  Make three sets of word 
cards – one containing root words, 
one containing prefixes and one 
containing suffixes. Divide the class 
into teams, then, mix the root word 
cards with either the prefixes or 
suffixes.  Distribute an equal 
number of cards to each team and 
designate one team member to 
record words. Use a three-minute 
timer as students race to form as 
many words as possible from their 
cards. The recorder writes the 
words as they are formed so that 
they can be read aloud at the end 
of the game. Give one point for 
each correctly formed word. The 
team with the most points wins.   
   
Intermediate:  Using the same 
basic activity, mix both sets of 
affixes with the word cards.  
Students must use both in the 
creation of their words.  
 
Advanced: Have students use the 
meaning of the prefix or suffix to 
figure out the meaning of words.  
 
Have students 
complete a worksheet 
where they have to 
add prefixes and 
suffixes to base words 
and write their new 
meanings.

A suffix is a letter or group of letters 
added after a base word to alter its 
meaning and form a new word.  
 
Example:  
“Care” is a base word meaning to be 
“concerned with or interested in”.  
  
“Ful” is a suffix meaning “full of” or 
“filled”.  
  
care + ful = careful  
“Careful” would now mean “full of 
care” or “concern”.

Objective 2.30: Add inflectional endings (with or without) spelling changes. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
An inflectional ending is a word part 
that is added to a base word.  This 
ending can make a word plural, 
change word tense, or help to make 
comparisons.  Inflectional endings are:  
s, es, ing, ed, er and est.  
 
1. Adding “er” and “est”  
If a word ends in a “consonant” 
and “y”, change the “y” to “i” and 
add “er” or “est”.  
 
Example:  happy – happier 
 
If the word ends in a “consonant” and 
“e” remove the “e” and add “er” or 
“est”. 
 
Example:  late - latest 
 
Sample Words:  
 
happier  
fancier  
silliest  
simpler  
bravest 
finest 
 
 
2. Adding “ed” and “ing”  
If the base word ends in a consonant 
vowel consonant and a stressed 
syllable, double the final consonant 
Basic: Have students draw two 
columns. The heading of the first 
column should be Base Word. 
The second column should be 
whichever inflectional ending is 
being taught (-s, -ed, -ing). Give 
students the base word to write in 
the first column and have them 
rewrite the words correctly with 
the inflectional ending in the 
second column.  
   
Intermediate:  Give students a 
cube. Write only the numbers one 
two and three on the cube. Have 
them take turns in groups of four 
or five rolling the cube. If they roll 
number one they must supply a 
word that has one letter added to 
it (e.g. schools). If they roll a two 
they must say a word that has two 
letters added to it (wished), etc.  
   
Advanced:  
Have students place inflections 
correctly on word endings to make 
sentences correct according to the 
tense, mood, voice, number, 
gender, etc. A worksheet will be 
Administer a rote 
memorization test.

Example:  control - controlling 
  
If the base verb ends in consonant 
and e, remove the e and add ing or 
ed. 
 
Example:  skate - skating  
 
If the base verb ends in “ie”, change 
the “ie” to “y” and add “ing”.

3. Adding “s” and “es”    
If the word ends in ch, s, ss, sh, x or 
z, just add the inflectional ending "es" 
to the word.  
 
Example:  bunch – bunches 
given with various sentences and 
root word endings. The students

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The two main spellings of words that we 
use in The Bahamas are a mixture of 
British English and American English. It 
is important to distinguish between the 
two because of the spelling and 
pronunciation differences.  
  
British English was influenced by 
words adopted from languages like 
French and German. 
 
American English focuses on how the 
word sounds when spoken. 
  
Some spelling differences can be found 
at the end of words or the spelling 
changes completely.   
 
For Example:   
British   
American  
-ce 
-se 
-re 
-er 
-our 
-or 
-t 
-ed 
-que 
-k 
-se 
-ze 
-l 
-ll 
-ogue 
-og 
Basic:  Have students review a 
list of words and identify whether 
the British or American spelling is 
used. 
  
Intermediate: Present students 
with various scenarios and ask 
students to write the spelling of 
the word that would be 
appropriate given the context. 
 
Examples:   
 You are completing an exam 
at the University of Miami. 
 
 You are writing a shopping list 
for a friend from Great Britain. 
  
Advanced: Give students a 
spelling test where they have to 
provide both the British and 
American spelling.

Not all the words spoken in English 
are English words.  Their roots 
were formed in another 
language. Being able to recognize 
certain roots can assist with 
spelling and understanding what 
particular words mean.  It can also 
help to see connections between 
words.  
  
Spanish  
Spanish words entered the English 
vocabulary through several 
means:   
 
a. With the arrival of Columbus in 
The Bahamas came the 
establishment of trade with people 
from Spain.  Through this 
interaction, the Spanish introduced 
new words  
 
b. Spanish words are used 
to identify foods because 
there were no English words for 
those items.  
  
 
 
Basic: Have students locate the 
countries being studied on a Map of 
the World. Play video clips where 
students can hear the words from 
the different languages being

Kid movie can be used for 
Japanese. Have them record the 
words that they hear.

Many of the settlers who came 
from Europe settled in North 
America.   They were from the 
Netherlands.  Many of the words 
from their language became a part 
of the American culture.  Given the 
close ties that The Bahamas 
shares with the United States, 
these words naturally became a 
part of the language of Bahamians.

It is important when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at 
which you are reading, the rise and 
fall of your voice, and your 
expression.  
  
Rate – Refers to how fast or how 
slowly one speaks.  Be careful not 
to speak so slowly that listeners 
lose interest. Do not read too 
quickly; otherwise, the words may 
not be clear, and the listeners may 
find it difficult to follow.  
  
Intonation – Refers to the rise and 
fall of the voice to reflect what is 
happening in the reading piece.  
  
Vocal Expression – The tone of 
the reader should reflect the mood 
of the piece.   
Examples  
Sad- Read slowly, lower the voice  
Angry – Loud, booming voice  
Happy – light voice  
Afraid – stuttering voice  
  
Pitch of Voice - Refers to the 
loudness or softness of the voice.  
Basic:  To assist with controlling the 
loudness and softness of the voice, 
have students say the alphabet from 
“A to L” in this manner.  
  
A-C – soft  
D-F – medium loud  
G-I – Loud  
J-l – Very Loud  
  
Then have students do the reverse. 
Ask students to read various texts in 
varying degrees of loudness and 
softness.    
 
Intermediate:  Have students listen to 
a recording of an audio story.  Stop at 
different points.  Discuss how the 
character is feeling. Have students 
provide information to support their 
inferences.  Highlight the techniques 
that the actor used to relay those 
emotions.

Resources 
Text structure refers to how an author 
organizes information in a text. Being 
aware of non-fiction text structures and 
their purpose helps readers to navigate 
the text that they are reading.  There 
are five basic structures that authors 
use. 
 
 Description - Provides a variety of 
information about a particular topic.   
 
Examples:  brochures, menus.   
Keywords/phrases - for example, 
the characteristics of etc. 
 
 Sequence - Provides the order in 
which something happened or 
should happen.   
 
Examples: recipes, calendars         
Key Words - first, next, finally 
 
 Problem/Solution - Identifies a 
need and shows ways in which it 
can be addressed.  
 
Basic: Students can create a 
text structure anchor chart with a 
section for each type.  There 
should be a definition and 
examples. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
complete a text structure sort, 
where they are given cards to 
read and determine to which text 
structure the text on the card is 
referring. 
 
Advanced: Give students two to 
three pieces of text.  Have them 
identify what type of text 
structure the selections are. 
Students must justify their 
choices. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Give students different 
samples of non-fictional 
texts.  Have them identify 
the text structure used in 
each and give reasons for 
their choices.

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A well-written story has five (5) core 
elements. Being able to identify 
these elements and knowing how 
they work together in a story helps a 
reader to better understand the 
author’s work. The elements of a 
story include:  
  
Character: The people or animals 
and objects behaving like humans in 
the story are known as the 
characters. Paying attention to the 
words, thoughts, and actions of a 
character gives the reader clues 
about a character’s feelings and 
nature.  
  
To figure out the nature of a 
character, ask yourself these guiding 
questions:  
 What thoughts is the character 
having?  
 What is the character saying?  
 How is the character acting?  
 What type of attitude do these 
types of thoughts, actions, and 
words suggest?    
 
 
Basic: Movie Trailers Provide each 
student with a list of common 
universal themes. Play a movie 
trailer and have students predict 
what the movie might be about (the 
conflict and possible solutions). 
Challenge students to then predict 
the theme of the movie and provide 
evidence from the trailer to justify 
their choice.  
  
Use different trailers to repeat that 
same method for teaching the 
setting and characters. Provide 
additional guided practice with short 
stories.

Point of View: is about ‘who’ is 
telling the story. The speaker is 
known as the narrator. Narrators 
can be a character in the story or a 
witness who is not a character but is 
speaking about what happened. 
Pronouns used by the narrator give 
clues to help the reader figure out 
‘who’ is telling the story.  
  
 The First Person Point of View: 
The narrator is a character in the 
story. Pronoun Clues: I, me, my,

time can be in the past, present, or 
future. The place can be real or 
fantasy. If the author does not 
identify the setting, a good reader 
looks for details to figure it out.  The 
setting can include the weather, time 
of day, and seasons. However, not 
every setting is important to the 
story.   
  
To determine if the setting is 
important, a reader can ask:   
 Would the story change if the

different time and place?   
 Would the characters behave and 
feel differently in a different time 
and place?  
Plot: The plot refers to the order of 
the most important events in a story. 
A story plot is made up of a 
beginning (introducing the setting 
and characters), a conflict in the 
middle, and an end (telling how the 
problem is solved). The conflict of a 
story is something that goes wrong 
for the main character. The main 
character can face a conflict with

Context Clues refer to words that 
surround an unfamiliar word in a 
passage that give clues about the 
meaning of the new word.  Some 
context clues are: 
  
Synonyms – Words that mean the 
same or almost the same as an 
unfamiliar word.  
 
Example: 
The petrified or scared boy walked 
slowly to the principal’s office. 
 
Antonyms – Sometimes a context clue 
would contrast with a new word.  
 
Example:  Ashley was kind to the new 
boy, not vicious. 
  
Definition – This is the kind of context 
clue where the writer gives the meaning 
of or explains a word in a sentence.  
 
Example:  Mackerel, a small fish, is 
eaten with grits as part of a Bahamian 
breakfast.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The main idea of a text is the 
most important idea that the 
writer wants you to know about 
the topic. It is what is mostly 
being talked about in the text. 
Knowing the main idea helps a 
reader to better understand and 
organize the lesser details of the 
text when summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and retelling.   
 
Sometimes, a writer directly 
states the main idea in the text. It 
can be stated at the beginning of 
a paragraph as the topic 
sentence or the end as the 
concluding sentence.  
 
Sometimes, the main idea is 
unstated, and the reader must 
figure it out from the supporting 
details. The supporting details 
are the sentences that tell us 
more information about the main 
idea.  They answer questions 
such as who, where, when, what, 
and how.   
 
 
Basic: Have students explore several 
newspapers to discover how picture 
captions and headlines are examples of 
main idea phrases. Present students with 
a variety of pictures with a lot of details 
(action, people, etc). Lead students to 
read the pictures using The Visual

Objective 2.45: Differentiate between fact and opinion. 
 
Content

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
In a world filled with free-flowing 
information, “fake news”, and 
persuasive techniques, it is 
important that a person can tell the 
difference between a fact and an 
opinion.  
 
A fact is a statement that can be 
proven true or false.  This may be 
done through further reading, 
observation, or by asking an expert. 
 
Example: The Princess Margaret 
Hospital is located on Shirley Street. 
  
This can be proven by looking at a 
map or by visiting Shirley Street. 
  
An opinion is a statement that tells 
what someone is thinking or how the 
person feels about a particular thing.  
Opinions can change.  Opinions 
cannot be proven because they are 
based on someone's personal 
thoughts, feelings, and 
understanding.  Words that often 
provide clues that an opinion is 
being expressed are: think, feel, 
believe, best, worst, etc.  
Basic: Divide a worksheet designed to 
test the difference between facts and 
opinions into individual statements. Place 
them in a bag and have each student 
choose a statement. Assign two labelled 
spots in the classroom: one for facts and 
one for opinions. Allow students to 
classify their statements by moving 
under the correct label. Have students 
take turns reading their sentences aloud 
and defending their choice. Provide 
corrective feedback. Challenge learners 
to convert all the factual statements into 
opinions.  
  
Intermediate: Provide learners with a 
persuasive passage. Use The Think 
Aloud Strategy to demonstrate how to 
determine which statements are factual 
and which are opinionated. Provide 
guided practice with other short 
passages. Divide students into pairs and 
give them a passage to identify the 
factual statements with a highlighter and 
underline the opinions with a pencil. 
Check the accuracy of responses and 
give feedback.  
 
 
Spot the Error: Fill in 
the answers on a 
worksheet asking 
students to decide 
whether a statement is 
factual or opinionated. 
Intentionally include 
inaccurate answers.  
 
Provide students with 
the incorrect 
worksheet. Ask 
learners to spot and 
correct all the errors. 
Require students to 
provide a rationale for 
each correction made.

Resources 
When we compare, we look to see 
how two or more things are alike.  
Keywords such as “same”, “both”, 
“like” and “as” are clues that 
signal when things are being 
compared.  
   
When we contrast, we look to see 
how two or more things are 
different.  Keywords such as 
“different”, “however”, and “but” 
are clues that signal when things 
are being contrasted.   
  
The graphic organizer that is 
commonly used to compare and 
contrast is called a Venn 
Diagram. The Venn Diagram is 
simply a diagram that shows the 
overlapping of two circles.  The 
outer areas of each circle are used 
to indicate the individual 
characteristics of the item or thing 
being compared.  The inner part, 
where the circles overlap, is where 
the characteristics that they share 
in common are written.

Objective 2.48: Make inferences. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The author does not always directly 
tell the reader everything that is 
happening in the story.  However, the 
writer gives hints or clues so that the 
reader can figure out what is not 
stated directly.  Good readers use the 
information given, along with what 
they already know, to make 
inferences.   
  
There are several different types of 
inferences that can be made.  
 
1. Location – Authors may give 
clues as to where a particular thing 
or event is taking place or where 
someone might be headed.  To 
figure out clues related to location, 
when reading, ask the following 
questions:  What is in the 
environment?  How are the 
characters reacting to the 
environment?   
 
Example:   Derek gathered 
his towel and his goggles.  He 
smiled as he got the black inner 
tube from the garage so that they 
 
Basic:  Have students create a riddle 
about their favourite place to visit.  
Have them share the riddle with a 
friend.  Make the connection that 
solving a riddle is a lot like making 
inferences. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students read 
several scenarios.  They should use 
the information given to make 
inferences. This can be done as a 
whole class activity or in pairs.    
  
Example: Tim got his suitcase, 
passport, and ticket.   
  
Where is Tim most likely headed?  
What clue words helped you to infer 
the correct answer?  
 
Advanced:  As a class, read aloud 
passages where students have to 
make inferences about location, 
occupation, and time.  Discuss 
answers to inference-related 
questions.  Then have students do 
this activity in small groups and pairs 
before letting students work 
independently. 
Have students 
answer oral and 
written questions 
related to the three 
types of inferences 
studied.

could take it to the gas station to 
be blown up.  Where is Derek 
going? Using the clues and your 
own experiences, you should infer 
that he is going to the beach.   
 
2. Occupation – Writers can provide 
clues as to the type of work/job a 
person does.  To figure out clues 
related to occupation, when 
reading, ask the following 
questions:  What is the person 
wearing?  What is the person 
doing?  What types of materials 
or items are mentioned?    
 
Example:  Mr. Capron, dressed in 
his red t-shirt and brown pants, 
removed the nozzle from the gas 
tank, replaced the cover on the 
tank and collected a crisp $20.00 
bill. What is Mr. Capron’s job?  He 
is a pump attendant.   
 
3. Time – Instead of giving the exact 
time, day or month it is, authors 
give clues to help you infer the 
time.  To figure out clues related to 
time, when reading, ask the 
following questions:  What are the 
characters doing?  What is in

the environment? What sounds 
or scents are mentioned? 
   
Example:  Everyone arrived at the 
party dressed in red and white.  
The room was beautifully dressed 
in hearts.  The scent of 
chocolate, coming from the 
hundreds of little tiny chocolate 
kisses that could be found 
everywhere, hung in the air. Which 
month of the year is it most likely?  
February. 
 
Quite often, inferences made, have to 
be defended.  These questions can 
come in many different forms, but they 
are all asking the reader to provide the 
clues from the passage that helped 
them to make their inferences. 
 
Examples 
 How do you know? 
 Give evidence to support your 
answer. 
 Support your answer using 
information from the passage? 
 Why do you think this is the 
case?

Objective 2.49: Identify cause and effect. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A cause is an action or idea that makes 
something happen.  An effect is what 
happens because of this action or idea.  
   
A cause can have more than one effect as 
well as an effect can have more than one 
cause.  To find the cause-and-effect 
relationship during reading, a good reader 
asks:  
 
 What happened? (Effect)  
 Why did this happen? (Cause)   
 
Sometimes, an author or speaker may use 
a signal word to show the cause-effect 
relationship. Key/Signal Words: because, 
since, when, as a result, therefore, and so  
  
Example:   
“As a result of the tour bus being late, the 
tourist missed the cruise ship.”  
 
In this sentence the cause is, “The tour 
bus was late.”   
 
The effect is, “The tourist missed the 
cruise ship.”  
 
When keywords are not used, it is up to the 
reader to make the connection.  
 
Basic:  Let students gather in a 
circle.  Using a soft rubber ball, 
give a cause. Then, throw the ball 
to a student who gives an effect.  
That student then gives a new 
cause and throws the ball to 
another student for an effect.  As 
an alternative, the teacher can 
give an effect and have the 
student give a cause.  That cause 
becomes the new effect, and 
another student then gives a 
cause to that effect.  
   
Intermediate:  Have students 
work in small groups.  Give 
students an index card with a 
cause or an effect on it and have 
them find their partners to match 
the causes with the effects.

newspaper clippings and have 
them write a “cause and

Clue words that can signal 
generalizations are: all, none, most, 
many, usually, never, always,

they determined which sentences were 
generalizations while identifying the 
keywords used. Discuss their 
responses. 
  
Intermediate: Place students into 
small groups and provide them with a 
passage to read.  Have students 
identify, (by highlighting) all the 
generalizations.  Students should circle 
all the clue words.  Discuss their 
responses.

Every author has a reason for writing.  This 
is known as the author’s purpose. 
There are four common reasons for 
writing:  
 
1. To inform - This type of writing 
gives information about a concept to 
teach the reader something 
new. Examples:  a textbook or a “How 
to” book 
  
2. To entertain - This type of writing tells a 
story about real or imaginary characters, 
places, and events to evoke 
feelings such as joy, sadness, or 
suspense in readers. Examples:   a 
play, story, or lyrics to a song 
 
3. To describe - This type of writing allows 
the writer to use the senses to show a 
person, place, thing, or event through 
his/her eyes. It allows the writer to share 
feelings and emotions as 
well. Examples: a travel blog or a 
brochure about Disney World

Authors sometimes use propaganda 
techniques to spread ideas to persuade 
readers to think a certain way. Examples of 
a few are: 
 
 Bandwagon – Gives the impression 
that everyone is doing a particular thing 
and that is why readers should do it as 
well so that they are not left out. 
Example: “All of the cool kids are 
wearing Air Jordans to school.” 
 
 Testimonials – Celebrities, social 
media personalities, public figures, and 
movie stars may be used to endorse a 
product or a belief. 
Example: “Dr. Ian Turnquest takes 
these supplements every morning to 
maintain a healthy lifestyle.” 
 
 Name Calling – This is used to show a 
person or a product in a bad light.

 Regardless of the author’s purpose, there 
are clue words in his or her writing that tell 
us how the author feels or his/her viewpoint 
about what has been written. To find out 
how the author feels about a piece of 
writing, ask the following questions. 
 
1. Are there “feeling” words included in the 
piece, such as  good, bad, great, 
fantastic, terrible etc.? 
2. How is the event, person, thing, or idea 
being described? irresponsible, 
organized, interesting, boring etc. 
3. Are negative or positive words being 
used in the piece?  distasteful, tasty, 
satisfying, dissatisfied, filling etc. 
4. Does the author appear to be arguing 
for one side over another? 
 
Examples: 
 
Informative Piece – The potcake breed of 
dogs is a mixture of breeds that are 
commonly found in the Caribbean.  These 
dogs are very loving, loyal, and street 
smart.  They can easily be house-trained.  
They make awesome pets!

author feels? The word “awesome” is 
used to indicate that potcakes would 
make good pets, so we can assume that 
the author likes potcakes. 
 
Descriptive Piece- The school’s play was 
excellent!  It was well-written and action-
packed.  The audience was entertained 
from start to finish as they laughed at the 
antics of Steven, who was the main 
character.  Steven was always getting into 
trouble but always managed to escape 
punishment. 
 
 Does the author use descriptive words 
to describe the play?  The author 
describes the play as being “excellent”, 
“well-written”, and “action-packed”.  He 
indicates that it was very entertaining 
and had the audience laughing. This 
means that he thought it went well.

Persuasive Piece- Dumping trash on the 
roadside is one of the most disgusting 
things that a human being can do.  We are 
a tourist destination.  No one wants to go 
on vacation to view trash.  Garbage also 
attracts rats and roaches, which can

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Good readers use details and what is 
already known to draw conclusions. 
A conclusion is a logical decision that 
the reader reaches after identifying 
clues in the text as well as prior 
knowledge. This conclusion should 
make sense using the information 
provided.   
 
Example:  The puppy’s tummy began 
to rumble.  His last meal was yesterday 
morning.  He sniffed fresh bread baking 
and moved in that direction.  Just then, 
Mrs. Rolle opened her back door and 
placed a tray of golden-brown loaves of 
bread on the back porch to cool and 
went inside. The puppy edged closer. 
 
The inference here is that the puppy is 
hungry.  The clues are: “His tummy is 
rumbling” and “He has not eaten since 
yesterday morning”.  
 
Based on this information, the 
conclusion that can be drawn is that the 
puppy will eat the bread that has 
been placed on the porch to cool.  
We can conclude this because he has 
not eaten in a while, and he is edging 
Basic:  Have students view the 
first few strips of a newspaper 
cartoon.  Have them use what 
they see to draw a logical 
conclusion about what will happen 
next. 
   
Intermediate:  Pantomime  
Have students create scenarios 
and use pantomime to share them 
with their classmates. Peers 
viewing the pantomime have to 
draw conclusions. The scenarios 
must come from topics in 
Reading, Social Studies, or 
Science.  
 
Advanced: Have students read 
the lines from popular songs, 
poems, or interviews about our 
national heroes, such as the 
Golden Girls, Sir Milo Butler etc.  
Ask them to draw conclusions 
about these individuals.  Have 
them support their answers. 
 
Have students read a 
passage and draw 
conclusions based on 
what they have read.

Good readers can use the following 
guided questions to help them draw 
conclusions:  
 
 What are the facts?  
 What is the meaning of the facts 
given?  
 Do the characters’ appearance, 
thoughts, words, or behaviour tell 
anything about them?

Objective 2.53: Make judgements. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Making judgements is more than 
just forming an opinion about 
characters, events, and ideas in a 
story or article that may have no 
consequence.  Judgements are 
decisions that are made based 
on evidence found in a passage, 
what the readers knows, and the 
reader’s own experiences, 
beliefs, morals, and values.    
    
When reading fiction, readers 
make judgements by agreeing or 
disagreeing with a character’s 
actions.  They may also decide if 
a character or an action is fair or 
unfair, wise, or foolish or generous 
or selfish.  
   
When reading nonfiction, readers 
make judgements by agreeing or 
disagreeing with what the author 
wrote.    
   
Judgements should always be 
supported by evidence from the 
passage.  
  
 
Basic: Students can read various 
messages (SMS or WhatsApp) and 
make judgements about the sender.  
Students should support their 
judgements using the text, gifs, emojis, 
and images that were sent in the 
message.    
  
Intermediate: Thumbs up or 
down!  The teacher and student 
volunteers will read short passages.  
Students will put their thumbs up or 
down to show if they agree or disagree 
with the character’s actions (fiction) or 
the author’s viewpoint (nonfiction).  Have 
various students discuss their 
judgements and the details from the 
passage that supports the judgement 
made.  
  
Advanced: Have students read a 
persuasive passage/essay.  Direct them 
to discuss the paragraph using 
questions such as:  
 
 Do you agree with the author?  Why 
or why not?  
 Did the author offer good advice?  
Why or why not?  
Have students read a

judgements about 
what was read.

A proverb is a common saying or 
phrase that is used to give advice or 
explain what is believed to be true 
based on experience.  
Some common ones are:  
 
“Every shut eye ain’t sleep.” One 
must be careful because some 
people who seem not to be paying 
attention are paying attention.    
 
“Fisherman never calls his own 
fish stink.”  Some people will never 
acknowledge or admit to their 
shortcomings, faults, flaws or 
mistakes.   
 
“Leopard can’t change its spots.”  
People cannot change their basic 
personalities or habits.  
 
“All good things must come to an 
end.”  Everything ends; good times 
don’t last forever.  
 
“Beggars can’t be choosers.” If 
you’re in a bad situation and 
someone offers to help you, you have 
to take whatever they give you and 
shouldn’t ask for more. 
 
Basic:  Group students and 
provide each group with 
popular proverbs that have 
missing words.  Students 
will paste the missing 
word(s) to complete the 
proverb.

Good readers recognize when an 
author is using figurative language. 
Figurative language refers to “a 
phrase or group of words that mean 
something different altogether from 
what is being said or written”. To 
decide if a phrase has a figurative 
meaning, ask: “Could this really 
happen, or does this make 
sense?” 
  
Alliterations and Onomatopoeias 
are types of figures of speech that 
act as the sound effects of the text. 
Focusing on a particular sound or 
description helps the readers to see 
a clearer picture of what is being 
described. 
  
Alliterations are created by 
repeating the beginning sound in 
two or more neighbouring words. 
  
Example: The wicked witch wildly 
whooshed away. 
  
Onomatopoeia refers to words that 
are actual sounds.  
Basic: Tongue Twisters in 
Context Have students read aloud 
Dr. Suess’ “Oh, Say Can You Say?. 
Lead from their emotional responses 
to the tongue twisters to discuss the 
effects of alliteration and 
onomatopoeia on readers. 
 
Intermediate: Have students read 
an online Garfield comic book 
before identifying the alliteration and 
onomatopoeia in context.  
 
Provide students with a page of the 
comic book but remove all speech 
except for alliterations or 
onomatopoeias. Incorporate the

When trying to interpret an 
alliteration and onomatopoeia, a 
reader can ask: 
  
1. What person, place, thing, or 
idea is being described? 
2. What is the sound effect telling 
me about this person, place, 
thing, or idea?   
3. What does the author want me to 
think or feel about the thing 
being described? 
Similes and Metaphors make 
comparisons of two unlike things. 
  
Similes are phrases that begin with 
like or as.  
  
Example: The COVID-19 pandemic 
hit us like a rushing tsunami.  
  
However, metaphors are phrases 
that do not use the words like or as. 
  
Example: The soldier cried a river 
of tears when her father waved 
goodbye.

Handwriting can tell a lot about a person.  Is 
this person neat, organized, and careful?  
This means that it is important to pay careful 
attention to our handwriting.  
  
Ensure that the letters are of the appropriate 
size and height.  Leave sufficient space 
between words.  
  
When writing sentences on lined paper, 
ensure that the margins are observed.  There 
is a left red margin and a right red margin.  
  
Unless you are writing a paragraph, begin 
the line of writing at the left margin and end it 
at the right margin.  Use syllabication rules 
to break up a word that may be too long to 
include without going over the right margin.  
  
When writing a paragraph, indent the first line.  
This means that space about the size of a 
“thumb” is left between the left margin and the 
start of your sentence.  The second line in the 
paragraph should begin right at the left 
margin. Letters of invitations and special 
messages can be written using cursive or a 
decorative form of writing called calligraphy. They 
can also be designed using a computer.

Resources 
Over 3,000 years ago, the Ancient 
Romans invented symbols to write 
numbers that included letters from the 
Latin alphabet.  
  
I represents 1  
V represents 5  
X represents 10  
L represents 50 
C represents 100 
D represents 500 
M represents 1,000  
  
To represent some numerals, a 
combination of symbols is used.  
  
Example:    8 = VIII  
  
Roman numerals can be written using 
capital letters or small letters.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students write 
numbers in a series of up to 50 
using Roman numerals.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
write dictated Roman 
Numerals.  
  
Advanced:  Have students 
visit a website that sells 
vehicles.  Have them cut out 
pictures of their five favourite 
vehicles.  Ask them to write the 
make and model of the car 
along with the year.  The year 
should be written using Roman 
Numerals.  
 
Have students write 
dictated Roman Numerals. 
Use a rubric to assess 
students’ writing.

written similarly to the number 2. Start 
below the top line, curve up and 
around, go straight down and stop just 
above the line.   
  
Exclamation mark/point: The 
exclamation mark/point is written similar 
to the number 1. Start at the top.  Draw 
a line straight down.  Stop just above 
the bottom line. Place a dot on the line 
just below where you stopped.  
  
Apostrophe: The apostrophe is used 
before an “s” to show possession.  
When writing it, begin below the top line 
with a dot.  Move up, around and slant 
down. Commas are used to separate 
words in a series, when writing dates 
and also to separate who is speaking

The full format of a date includes the 
day, date, month, and year. This is 
normally written as the heading in 
students’ books daily.   
  
Example:  Monday, 17th October, 2022  
                 Monday, October, 17th, 2022  
  
The date in the full format is always 
written using the ordinal number.    
  
Dates can also be written in the 
abbreviated format.  Abbreviations for 
the day and month are used.   
  
Example: Mon., 17th Oct. 2022  
   
The date can also be written using just 
numbers.  The day of the week is written 
first, followed by the number of the 
month and the year.

conventions. 
 
GRAMMAR AND USAGE 
 
Objective 3.17: Distinguish between sentences and fragments. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A sentence is a group of words 
that express a complete 
thought.  It has two main parts:  
a subject and a predicate.   
 
A fragment is an incomplete 
sentence. It can be written like 
a sentence with a capital letter 
at the beginning and end 
punctuation, but it doesn’t 
express a complete thought.  It 
is usually missing a subject or a 
verb. 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Prepare sentences and fragments on 
strips of paper to play Sentence Dunk: Have two 
baskets labelled “Sentence” and “Fragment”.  
Have students take turns reading the group of 
words on the strips aloud.  Have them decide if it 
is a sentence or a phrase.  If they are correct, 
have them crumple the paper to make a “phrase” 
or “sentence” ball.  Ask them to throw it into the 
correct basket for a score. 
 
Intermediate:  Place sentences and fragments 
on a card that is in the shape of a car.  Tell 
students that they are now mechanics who must 
figure out if any repairs need to be done to each 
vehicle.  They must correct the fragments by 
writing the corrected sentence on a sheet of 
paper.  If it is already a complete sentence, they 
will record it under a column labelled “Already 
Tuned”. 
 
Advanced:  Have students go on a fragment 
scavenger hunt around the classroom.  Place 
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet where 
they have to 
identify sentences 
and fragments.

A declarative/telling sentence 
makes a statement.  Use a period 
(.) at the end of a declarative 
sentence. 
 
An interrogative /asking sentence 
asks a question. Use a question 
mark (?) at the end of an 
interrogative sentence. 
 
An Exclamatory Sentence shows 
strong feelings.  It ends with an 
exclamation mark (!) 
 
An Imperative Sentence gives a

sentences begin with an action 
word, such as ‘call’, ‘tell’, or ‘go’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Give students a set of word 
cards and punctuation cards. Have 
them use the cards to form different 
types of sentences with correct 
punctuation.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A run-on sentence is two or more 
sentences that are incorrectly joined 
by a comma or by nothing at all. 
 
Example of a Run-On Sentence 
and Ways to Correct It: 
 
“John left his bag at the store his 
sister just brought it home.” 
 
Without any punctuation, this run-on 
sentence is difficult to follow, even 
though it is short. Easy corrections 
include: 
 
1. John left his bag at the store. His 
sister just brought it home. 
 
2. John left his bag at the store, and 
his sister just brought it home. 
 
3. John left his bag at the store; his 
sister just brought it home. 
 
4. Because John left his bag at the 
store, his sister brought it home. 
Basic:  Write run-on sentences on 
sentence strips. Have students work in 
pairs – one reads the sentence aloud, 
stopping where he/she thinks the first 
sentence should end; the other reads 
the remaining portion of the sentence 
strip. Have them write the two 
sentences. They should ensure that 
they put in the necessary conjunction or 
capitalization and punctuation marks. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students play the 
game “Cluster Buster” where they must 
eliminate the cluster in run-on 
sentences.  They must choose a card 
from a bag that contains run-on 
sentences.  They will then have 20 
seconds to “bust” the clustered 
sentence, thus correcting the run-on 
error.    
 
Advanced: Provide students with an 
article that contains five run-on 
sentences.  After reading the article, 
have each student rewrite it to make 
sentences with proper punctuation and 
capital letters. 
Have students re-
write run-on 
sentences correctly.

Objective 3.20: Identify different types of nouns. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Nouns are words that name a person, 
place, animal, thing, or idea. 
These are known as common nouns 
because they do not name a particular 
person, place, animal, thing, or idea.  
 
Common nouns are usually not 
capitalized unless they begin a sentence 
or are part of a title. 
 
Examples:   
 Person:   police 
 Place:      downtown 
 Animal:   dog          
 Thing:     building 
 Idea:       fear 
 
A proper noun is the name of a particular 
person, place, or thing.  A proper noun 
begins with a capital letter. Days of the 
week, months of the year, and holidays 
are proper nouns. 
 
Examples:   
 
Charles Smith 
Bamboo Shack 
Wednesday 
 
Andros 
East Street 
Samsung 
Doctor’s Hospital 
 
Basic:  Play “Noun Dunk”.  Have 
two baskets labelled “Common 
Noun” and “Proper Noun”. Have 
students throw word balls into the 
correct basket for a score. 
 
Intermediate:  Call out a common 
noun, such as “country”. Have 
students name as many proper 
nouns in that category as possible 
e.g. “The Bahamas”, “Jamaica”, 
“Haiti”. This can be played as a 
game, in teams, and maybe written 
or oral. If a student calls out a 
common noun, instead of a proper 
noun, other students/teams may 
challenge it for extra points. 
 
Advanced:  Present students with a 
grade four supply list of common 
and proper nouns. All items are 
typed in lower case (pencil, ruler, 
oxford primary dictionary, elmer’s 
glue, bahamas primary mathematics 
book 4, etc.). Have students re-write 
this list differentiating between the 
common and proper nouns.  Have 
the use of capital letters where 
necessary. 
Have students 
identify common and 
proper nouns in a 
passage.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A singular noun names one person, 
place, or thing.   
 
A plural noun names more than one 
person, place, or thing. 
 
Add ‘s’ to the end of the noun to form 
plurals of most nouns that end in 
vowels, or in any consonants except 
‘ss’, ‘x’, ‘ch’, ‘sh’ or ‘y’.  
 
Add ‘es’ to the end of the word to 
form plurals of nouns that end in ‘ss’, 
‘o’ ‘x’, ‘ch’ or ‘sh’. 
 
For nouns that end in a consonant 
and ‘y’, form plurals by changing the 
‘y’ to ‘i’ then adding ‘es’ to the end of 
the word. 
 
Examples:   
 cherry – cherries 
 story - stories 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students play a Memory 
Match Game where they have to 
match a singular word card with its 
plural partner that has no spelling 
change. Have students put cards in a 
grid face down.  Have them take turns 
turning over two of the cards in search 
of a match.  Once the cards are 
matched, the student gets to keep 
them.  If they are not matched, 
students must return them to their 
original positions.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Some nouns have irregular plural 
forms.  They are not formed by adding 
‘s’ or ‘es’. Instead, the spelling of the 
noun must change. 
 
To form the plural of nouns ending with 
‘f’ or ‘fe’, drop the ‘f’ or ‘fe’ and add –
‘ves’. 
 
Examples:   
       shelf- shelves  
       knife – knives 
 
Some exceptions are roofs and 
proofs. 
 
Some words change their vowels. In 
some words ‘oo’ is changed to ‘ee’. 
 
Examples:   
       tooth – teeth  
       goose – geese 
 
In some words ‘an’ is changed to 
‘en’. 
 
Examples:   
woman – women 
 
Basic: Sing the song “Ten Green 
Bottles Sitting on the Wall’. 
Substitute ten green bottles with ten 
irregular plural nouns in the song. 
 
Examples:   
“Ten little children, sitting on the 
wall, If one little child should 
accidentally fall, then there would 
be nine little children sitting on the 
wall. Nine little mice sitting on the 
wall. If one little mouse should 
accidentally fall, then there would 
be eight little mice sitting on the 
wall. Eight little oxen sitting on the 
wall. If one little ox should 
accidentally fall, then there would 
be seven 
little oxen sitting on the 
wall.” (The song continues to          
zero.)

a chart of nouns with irregular plural 
forms. They should display both 
singular and plural forms of each 
noun using a different colour 
marker or pencil.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A compound word is made up of 
two smaller words.   
   
The two words that make up the 
compound word often indicate the 
meaning of the compound word.  
  
bath + room = bathroom – a room 
for bathing.   
  
foot + ball = football - a sport that 
involves kicking a ball.  
  
Some compound words are written  
using a hyphen.

 
great-grandmother  
 
father-in-law  
 
seventy-two 
 
Basic:  Give students a passage in 
which only half of each compound word 
is given. Students must read the 
passage and provide the missing half of 
each word. For example, a sentence 
might read “After an hour at the gym, 
Dan headed home to take a long, hot 
shower in the ___room.” The student 
should supply the word bath as the 
missing half of the compound word.

Objective 3.26: Form singular and plural possessive nouns. 
 
Content

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The possessive form of a noun is 
used to show ownership. Only 
nouns can be possessive. 
 
A singular possessive noun is 
used to show ownership by one 
person or thing.  The possessive of 
a singular noun is formed by adding 
an apostrophe (’) and the letter ‘s’ at 
the end of the word.  
 
Example: the officer’s whistle 
 
A plural possessive noun is used 
to show ownership by more than 
one person or thing. There are two 
rules for forming a plural possessive 
noun. 
 
1. If the plural noun ends with the 
letter ‘s’, add an apostrophe (’) 
after the ‘s’. 
 
2. If the plural noun does not end 
with the letter ‘s’, add an 
apostrophe (’) and the letter ‘s’ 
at the end of the word.  
 
 
Basic:  Write five sentences on the 
whiteboard. Provide each student 
with sentence strips. Have them 
write the singular possessive noun 
to complete each sentence.  
 
Examples:  
 David lives in Exuma. _______ 
home is in Barrataree.  
 
 David lives in Exuma. David’s 
home is in Barrataree. 
 
Intermediate:  Use picture cards (or 
word cards) to practice using the 
possessive form of common nouns. 
Show a picture of a dog and a bone 
and have students describe the 
bone as “The dog’s bone”, either 
orally or in writing.  Cards may have 
the singular (word or picture) on one 
side, and the plural on the other. A 
picture of two or more dogs or the 
word card “dogs” should elicit the 
response “The dogs’ bones”.

Resources 
A verb is a word that tells what the 
subject of a sentence does, did or 
will do. A verb can also express the 
state of being.  
  
Action verbs express action.  
Example: My classmates created a 
puzzle.  
  
Linking verbs do not express 
action. Instead, they connect (or 
link) the subject of the verb to 
additional information about the 
subject.  
 
Example: We became computer 
geniuses last year.  
  
Some examples of linking verbs 
are:  am, is, are, was, were, feel, 
look, seem, grow, and appear.   
   
Example: Virtual classes are 
exciting.   
 
Helping verbs come before main 
verbs and provide more details 
about the time of an action. Helping  
Basic: (Action Verbs) Have students 
play “Charades” with verbs. Give each 
student a card.  Have them take turns 
acting out the verbs on the cards. 
Have students raise their hands to 
guess the verb/action word. If correct, 
they will become the next actor.  
  
(Linking Verbs) Students can

Objective 3.30: Apply the correct tenses to verbs. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A verb changes its form depending on 
if the action is happening, has 
happened, or will happen. Telling the 
time an action occurs is known as the 
verb tense.  
 
There are three main tenses: past, 
present, and future. 
  
The present tense of a verb shows 
what is happening now.  
Examples: They work. She studies. 
  
The past tense of a verb shows 
actions that have already happened.    
Regular past tense verbs end in –ed.  
Examples: They worked. She 
studied. 
  
The future tense of a verb shows an 
action that will happen.  It is usually 
formed with the helping verbs “will” or 
“shall”. Examples: They will work.  
She shall study.  
  
Sometimes, authors revise their 
writing by changing the verbs to a 
different tense.  
Basic: Have students identify the 
verbs in sentences.  Ask them to 
read the verbs to a partner and 
state whether it is the past, 
present, or future tense.    
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
work in small groups to 
choose from a book a paragraph 
that describes a historic event in 
the past tense. Using large chart 
paper, have students rewrite the 
paragraph in the present tense. 
Groups can share both versions 
with the class (optional).

A sentence has two parts: the 
complete subject and the 
complete predicate.  
  
The complete subject of a 
sentence includes the main noun or 
pronoun and the additional words 
that tell who or what the sentence is 
about. The subject is usually found 
at the beginning of the sentence.

The simple subject is 
the main word or words in a 
sentence that tells who or what the 
entire sentence is about.  
 
The simple subject is often just one 
noun or pronoun and is found within 
the complete subject of a sentence.

The simple predicate of a sentence 
is the main word or words that 
tell(s) what the subject of the 
sentence is or does.  
 
The simple predicate is a verb and 
can be found within the complete 
predicate of a sentence.   
 
Example: All of us went into the 
store to buy treats.

The subject of a sentence can 
be singular or plural. When it 
is singular, an “s” is added to 
the verb.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
An adjective is a word that describes or 
modifies a noun or a pronoun. Adjectives 
can tell what kind, how many or which 
one. Adjectives can be used to add 
descriptive details when writing.  
 
Adjectives can compare two things that 
may be the same or different in some way.  
If they are different, we compare them by 
adding “er” to the end of the adjective.   
 
Example:  
This bed is harder than that one. This 
road is safer than the other.    
 
When comparing more than two things, 
some adjectives take on the “est” ending.  
 
Example: 
He is the tallest boy in the school.     
 
Some adjectives compare by adding the 
words more (comparing two things) and 
most (comparing three or more things).  
 
Examples: 
Basketball is a more physical sport than 
fishing.   
Winter is the most wonderful season of all.  
Basic: Ask students to stand.  
Display an object or a picture of 
an object. Give the first student 
a ball.  Have the student 
provide an adjective to describe 
the object and then pass the 
ball to the next player.  The 
next player then calls out 
another adjective. If the student 
cannot produce an adjective 
quickly, then he or she is out 
and must sit.  Once three 
players cannot provide an 
adjective, it is opened to the 
class for their answers, and

Resources 
An adverb is a word that gives more 
information about a verb, an 
adjective, or another adverb. It tells 
“how”, “when”, “where”, or “to what 
degree”.  
 
Adverbs that tell how an action took 
place, often end in “ly”.  
 
Examples:  quickly, slowly, lazily, 
nicely, and loudly.  
 
Some adverbs describe when 
something happens. This can also 
include how often and how long.  
 
When – yesterday, now  
How often – weekly, always  
How long – forever, shortly  
 
Adverbs can also tell where.  
 
Examples:  inside, outside, around, 
through, below  
 
Adverbs can also indicate to what 
degree or to what extent. When 
comparing two things, use “er”. For  
more than two use “est”.  
Basic: Have students play Adverb 
Scattergories, a game in which 
players are given a category 
(where, when, how often, how long) 
and must call out adverbs in that 
category.  
 
Intermediate: Play the card game, 
"Spoons" using adverbs. Have 
groups of students brainstorm ten 
activities they saw, read or heard 
about recently. Then have them

led the parade. Have a member of 
each group share their sentences. 
Then have the class decide 
whether the adverbs tell “how”, 
“when” or “where”.

A preposition is a word placed before 
a noun to show its relationship to some 
other word in the sentence.   
Prepositions can tell location, direction, 
time, and relationships. 
Examples of commonly used 
prepositions are: about, above, across, 
after, against, among, around, at, 
before, behind, beside, between, by, 
down, during, except, for, from, in, near, 
of, off, on, over, through, to, toward,

They must be followed by an object to 
be considered a preposition.

Coordinating Conjunctions join 
words, phrases, and sentences.  
Some coordinating conjunctions 
are: and, but, for, so, yet and or.  
 
Coordinating conjunctions are used in 
several ways: 
 
Joining words 
Jan and Jean will get the groceries 
from the shop around the corner. 
 
Joining phrases 
The scared dog jumped over the 
fence and through the yard. 
 
Joining Sentences 
John loves to fish, yet he will never 
get on a boat. 
 
When a conjunction separates two 
sentences, a comma should be placed 
after the first sentence and before the 
conjunction as shown above.   
 
When coordinating conjunctions join 
two sentences into one, the sentence 
is called a compound sentence. 
Basic: Organize students into 
groups, and provide each group 
with conjunction cards. Using 
PowerPoint or the whiteboard 
display a sentence that has a line 
where the conjunction should be. 
Instruct students to hold up the 
conjunction card that will make the 
most sense in the blank space.  
Discuss responses and 
alternatives.

Acronyms are a type of abbreviation 
that quite often refer to businesses, 
companies, or ideas.   
 
They are usually formed by using the 
first letters of words in a name.    
  
Example:  BTC – Bahamas 
Telecommunications Corporation  
  
Sometimes, more than the initial letters 
may be used in forming the acronym.  
  
Example:  CARICOM - Caribbean 
Community  
  
Quite often, letters in people’s first or 
last names are used to describe them 
during special ceremonies.   
 
Example: 
K – K is for kind.  She is always  
       helping others 
A – A is for artistic.  She can draw! 
Y – Y is for yellow-her favourite  
       colour.

methods.  
  
Writing- ideas are organized and 
written in sentences  
  
Revising- the writer reads the piece 
and makes necessary improvements   
  
Editing- the writer checks 
capitalization, punctuation, spelling, 
and other grammar mistakes.

Resources 
There are four main types of writing. 
They each serve a different purpose. 
 
1. Narrative Writing – This type of 
writing tells a story.  It is mainly 
written for entertainment. A personal 
narrative tells a story about the 
writer. 
 
2. Descriptive Writing – This type of 
writing may describe a person, 
place, thing, or event.  The senses 
as well as figurative language such 
as similes and metaphors are used 
to give details about what is being 
described so that a clear picture is 
painted in the reader’s mind.  
 
3. Expository Writing – This type of 
writing provides information and 
gives an explanation or directions. 
 
4. Persuasive/Opinion Writing - This 
type of writing expresses how the 
writer thinks or feels about a 
particular subject. 
 
Basic:  Provide students with 
everyday types of writing that 
represent the four types.  Have 
them work in groups to classify 
them.  Ask them to share with the 
class and give their reasons for 
placing them in their groups. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students

Sequence is the order in which things 
happen or should happen.  Sequential 
order is very important when one is 
relaying a story, writing directions, or 
providing instructions for performing a 
particular task, or describing 
something. 
 
Before Words: ‘Prior to’, ‘last time’ 
and ‘until that time’ 
 
Words that Show First: ‘Starting 
with’, ‘in advance’ and ‘firstly’ 
 
Words that Show Next: ‘Secondly’, 
‘thirdly’, ‘soon after’, ‘in time’ and ‘right 
after’ 
 
Words that Show Last: ‘Finally’ and 
‘to conclude’  
 
Another way to put ideas in order is to 
use space order, particularly when 
describing the location of something. 
Space order tells about something 
from top to bottom or from left to 
right or vice versa.  Prepositions like 
‘above’ and ‘beyond’, relay specific 
images. 
Basic: Print pictures of a 
sequenced science-related event. 
Examples: the metamorphosis of 
tadpoles to frogs, flowers to seeds, 
etc. Mount the pictures on cards. 
For each set of pictures, have the 
students use transitional words to 
describe the order in which the 
metamorphosis takes place. 
 
Intermediate: Have students list 
ALL of the steps involved in putting 
on a shirt (this list should be very 
comprehensive) Present the shirt to 
the class so that everyone has the 
same kind of shirt in mind. Once 
everyone is done writing their steps 
choose two students to come to the 
front. Have one student provide 
his/her list of instructions one by 
one and have the other student 
carry out each step EXACTLY as 
directed. Unclear or omitted 
instructions will result in the 
incompletion of the task. Have 
several volunteers try their list of 
instructions. 
 
Advanced: Have students discuss

Objective 3.53: Organize ideas into a paragraph using a topic sentence and supporting details. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A paragraph is a group of sentences 
about the same idea. The main idea of 
a paragraph is what the paragraph is 
about.  The main idea is often relayed 
in the topic sentence which is usually 
the first sentence in a paragraph that 
gives information and is indented.  
Knowing the purpose of the essay will 
help in forming the topic sentence. 
 
Other sentences tell more about the 
main idea and are called supporting 
details.  If you want to describe the 
way something looks or feels, your 
supporting details should be vivid 
descriptions.  If your purpose is to 
inform your reader, your supporting 
details should be facts. If your purpose 
is to persuade, then you should have 
solid reasons to support your 
viewpoint.   
 
The last sentence in a paragraph 
should tie the supporting sentences 
together. It is called the concluding 
sentence.  A strong conclusion sums 
up the main idea of a paragraph in a 
vivid way.   
Basic: Have students choose a 
favourite television show. Have 
them write one statement that 
encompasses how they feel about 
that show. Then have them list 
details that support their opinion 
and order these details based on 
their significance.  Have them use 
this list to write their ideas in 
paragraph form. 
  
Intermediate:  Present students 
with an interesting question like, 
“What is your favourite holiday?” 
Initiate a whole-class discussion 
that highlights several holidays

Monday and National 
Heroes/Discovery Day). Have 
students write a paragraph to 
answer the question and give 
supporting reasons for their 
opinion.

How a piece of writing is started is 
very important because it is at the 
beginning when many readers decide 
whether to continue reading or to 
stop.  The type of writing and the topic 
should be considered when writing an 
introduction.  Ensure that a topic 
sentence is provided.  
 
There are several different ways to 
begin a piece.  Writers should select 
the best one for the particular type of 
writing that they are doing.

Voice refers to how much of the writer 
can be felt in a piece.  Is the writer 
interested and passionate about what 
is being written?    
  
The work of many famous authors 
can be recognized by their voice and 
writing style.   
  
The writer’s voice comes through in 
the tone and mood of the 
piece.  Tone refers to the feeling that 
an author creates.  Is the piece 
serious? playful? angry? etc.   
  
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the piece.  Is 
the reader happy? sad? fearful?  It is 
important that the tone matches the 
message that the writer is trying to 
send.  If the subject is serious, for 
example, the language should not be 
light or funny.

you get to experience the thoughts of 
the characters.  
  
Personification - This is when the 
writing is done from the perspective 
of an animal or object.  This is 
accomplished by giving the animal or 
object human characteristics such as 
speaking or gesturing.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Writers often use dialogue in their 
narrative pieces to make them more 
interesting.  Quotation marks are used 
to set apart the exact words of the 
speaker from the rest of the 
sentence.  One of the quotation marks 
appears at the beginning of what was 
said and the other at the end.  The first 
word in a quote is capitalized. 
  
Example: 
“What is your name?” I quietly asked.  
  
Commas are mainly used to separate 
who is speaking from what is being 
said.   
   
Example: 
“Mark,” I shouted, “Come and get your 
bag.”  
We walked slowly to the gate, “Should 
we open it?” I asked.  
  
Quotation marks are also used to identify 
the title of a song or a piece of writing.  
 
Example: 
 “March on Bahamaland” is the name of 
our national anthem. 
Basic:  Present an image from a 
sitcom.  Have students write what 
the characters might be saying using

A descriptive essay is a group of 
paragraphs that can describe a 
particular person, place, or event.  
The details are presented in such a 
way that it makes it easy for the 
reader to visualize what the writer is 
describing.    
 
A descriptive essay should have a 
captivating introduction that provides 
the reader with an overview of what is 
being described.  The body of the 
essay should provide specific details 
about what is being described.  The 
writer should end with a concluding 
thought about the thing, place or 
person that was described.    
 
There are several strategies that 
authors use when writing 
descriptively.  The words that are 
used to describe, should be carefully 
selected so that they convey detailed 
images to the readers. 
 
 
 
 
Basic: Have students watch 
YouTube videos on Similes, 
Metaphors, Hyperboles, and 
Onomatopoeia. Project an 
example of a literary device and 
have student groups compete to 
identify the literary device. They 
can explain their answer for 
bonus points. Groups can 
compose their examples of each 
literary device. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
read an excellent descriptive 
paragraph on an appropriate 
topic (The Lucayans, Crabbing 
in Andros, Junkanoo etc.). Have 
students discuss what makes 
the paragraph so “descriptively 
rich”. Have students utilize some 
of these techniques in a 
paragraph of their own. 
 
Have students write a 
descriptive essay on a 
self-selected topic.

 Show Me, Don’t Tell Me is a 
strategy that authors use to 
provide interesting and descriptive 
details.  For example, instead of 
saying that a person is angry, the 
author shows that a person is 
angry. 
 
Example: 
“Her smile faded and was replaced 
by a straight line.  Her eyes 
narrowed, and her cheeks began 
to turn red.  She snarled, “Get out 
of my way now!”  She pushed 
Trevor aside and went marching to 
the principal’s office. 
 
 Words that focus on the senses 
are used:  what we can smell, 
taste, see, touch, and hear. 
 
Example:   
“When I arrived home, the scent of 
frying chicken hung in the air.  As 
I made my way into the kitchen,  I 
heard the popping of the oil, as 
several pieces of lightly floured 
chicken were slowly lowered into

words, similes etc., Have 
students compose a descriptive 
piece for their picture. Have 
students present their picture

 Literary Devices are also used as 
a tool for making writing 
interesting.  There are several of 
them that can be used. 
 
o Similes are phrases that begin 
with “like” or “as” and are used 
to compare two unlike things. 
Example: “Her dress was as 
colourful as a “rainbow.” 
 
o Metaphors are also used to 
compare. They do not use “like” 
or “as”. Example: “Stacy is all 
brains when it comes to 
Spelling.” 
 
o Alliterations are created by 
repeating the beginning sound 
in two or more neighbouring 
words. Example:  Benson 
bought a black BMX bicycle.  
  
o Onomatopoeias- These are 
words that are actual sounds.

address of the sender and the 
date. It is normally written in the 
right-hand corner at the top of the

the way to identify to whom the 
letter is being written.  It usually 
begins with “Dear.”  A comma 
follows the name of the person.

considered the main part of the 
letter.  Include all of the interesting 
details about family and friends 
and write about what you have

The Body of the Essay: This is where 
the writer develops the reasons to 
support their opinions.  Each paragraph 
in the body should represent one of 
those reasons with supporting 
evidence.    
 
Writers normally present their reasons 
in order of importance.  They begin with 
the most important reason to support 
their opinion and then present the 
others in descending order.  Several

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL  
ORAL PRESENTATION RUBRIC 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the oral presentation skills of students in grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors 
are so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: content and delivery. This gives the flexibility of use as teachers and students can decide if to focus on one aspect of 
an oral presentation or both sections.

USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEACHING OF READING 
 
 
THE READING PROCESS  
 
The reading process aims to provide readers with a systematic framework to monitor and guide their thinking, understanding, 
and response to a text. The overarching goal is for learners to eventually apply this process with automaticity inside and outside 
the classroom environment. However, to achieve this goal, readers must have multiple opportunities to observe this process 
being effectively applied to various texts and be allowed to use this method with guided support.  
 
The following Guide Steps for The Reading Process can be placed on individual bookmarks or posted on a classroom chart 
for ease of reference by students. 
 
BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
 Scan the Text. Ask yourself: 
o Is this text fiction or non-fiction?  
o Scan the cover, title, chapter 
headings, and pictures of a 
fictional text. 
o Scan the headings, bold print, 
and illustrations of a non-fictional 
text. 
o Skim read a few of the words. 
 
 
Think about what you know already 
about this topic.*  
 
 
Make predictions about what the 
 Read the text in chunks.  
 
 Stop and check if you understood 
what was read. Ask yourself: 
o What has happened so far? What 
important information was given 
already? 
o How am I feeling about what I am 
reading? 
o Do I need to re-read any 
confusing parts? 
o Can I see a clear picture in my 
mind of what is being shared? 
o Are the illustrations helping me to 
 Summarize and reflect on the main 
ideas of what you read. Ask yourself: 
o Did I learn any new information or 
ideas? 
o Do I have any burning questions 
left unanswered about this topic? 
 
 Connect it to your real life. Ask 
yourself: 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something else I read? 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something I have experienced 
before?

BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
text may be about.  
 
 
Think about what you may learn, 
feel, or encounter in this text. 
 
understand what I am reading? 
o Were my predictions correct? If 
not, what is my new prediction? 
 
 Figure out only important unknown 
words. Ask yourself: 
 Are there any context clues or 
word parts to help figure out the 
meaning?    
 Evaluate what you read. Ask 
yourself: 
o Did I agree or disagree with these 
ideas? 
o Have I changed my mind or 
feelings about this topic? 
 
 
*NOTE: Pay careful attention to the student’s responses here and determine if the reader has sufficient background 
knowledge about the topic to understand what is about to be read. If it seems that the reader does not, pause here and 
provide learning experiences to build knowledge before reading.  
 
 
BASAL READERS 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-levelled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate 
reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension 
skills, and vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 


 
258 
 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
THE LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE APPROACH 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the 
board or chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the language arts 
components (speaking, listening, writing, and reading) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teachers’ observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read 
orally. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps 
the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 


 
259 
 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading focuses on developing readers’ ability to independently apply both strategies and skills in context. Readers are 
arranged in groups of four to six based on their instructional reading level and provided more targeted reading instruction and 
support. The instructional sessions are focused on the students’ use of multiple strategies or skills in context.  
 
BASIC ROUTINE FOR USING GUIDED-READING INSTRUCTION 
1. 
Conduct a diagnostic assessment of readers. 
5. Provide direct instruction or coaching on a specific 
strategy or skill. 
2. 
Group students according to their reading levels. 
6. Offer meaningful activities to the rest of the class while 
engaged with a group. 
3. 
Select a variety of texts at the instructional level for each 
group. 
7. Conduct ongoing reading-level assessments to track 
progress. 
4. 
Allow students during group sessions to read the entire 
text or sections. 
8. Provide individual or peer-led instruction to students who 
require further instruction. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As a student progresses in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings about the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, 


 
260 
 
science and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, the more demand for 
reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  A lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ abilities and interests, and be ready to help students find the right books at the 
right time.  Learning students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can 
be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage 
students to visit their school libraries. 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least a 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate.

SAMPLE OF READING ENRICHMENT DAY MENU 
 
The Power of Choice! People are naturally more motivated to participate in an activity when given individual choice, and 
learning menus are built on this tendency. They are flexible enough to be used with any content, ability, or grade level. Here is 
a sample of a Reading Learning Menu that can be used on Enrichment Day. Students are to complete all activities from The 
‘Must Do’ category and choose reading activities from The ‘Can Do’ category according to their preference. 
 
MUST DO 
CAN DO 
In a nutshell 
 
Read a literary piece. 
Write a 10-word summary 
of the pages (or book) you 
have just read. 
Perfect Prediction 
 
Start a new book. Before 
you begin, make 3 
predictions based on the 
front cover. 
Setting

DAILY ROUTINE FOR VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION 
 
Vocabulary is the gateway to comprehension, and greater word knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding of a text. While 
this is true, it is impossible to teach the meaning of every word to students. Therefore, vocabulary instruction in the classroom 
should be reserved for words that would have the greatest impact on the comprehension of a text. When learning the meaning 
of an unknown word, the definition is only the first step. Students must have multiple opportunities to engage with the word and 
be able to use it in different forms and contexts. Below is a basic 5–10-minute daily routine for vocabulary instruction for 
unknown words:

DISCUSSION / 
PRESENTATION 
Give direct instruction 
on the meaning of the 
word. Provide 
descriptions, 
illustrations, and 
examples of the word 
usage in everyday life. 
 
Allow students to use 
pictures, words, or body 
movements to 
represent its meaning, 
description, 
explanation, or 
example. Encourage 
creativity. 
Provide vocabulary 
activities to deepen the 
experience (examples / 
non-examples, 
analogies, related 
words, word parts, 
compare & contrast 
meanings with other 
words, etc.). 
Play vocabulary word 
games with the 
focused words and 
other familiar words. 
Have students present 
their understanding of 
the word and its usage 
to a partner or another 
audience. Encourage 
creativity. 
NEXT STEP: The new vocabulary word can now be added to the classroom word wall or the students’ personalized spelling 
log. Be sure to continuously revise these words in a fun way!

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL: HANDWRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRIC 
OVERALL LEGIBILITY 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the legibility of students’ writing in grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors are so 
detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two sections: 
letter formation and presentation. This gives the flexibility of use, as teachers and students can focus on one aspect of their 
handwriting or both sections during assessments.

MATHEMATICS
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit


iv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 –  2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
  
 
 
Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 


xi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection.

A DISCUSSION 


xii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example, Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics. 
 
Concepts 
 
 
 
Scheme or plan for Mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and fractions,  
 
Content Standards   
            Cover what students are to learn in various subject areas, such as Mathematics and Science.  
 
Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three.

xv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
                                                                                                                       
 
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


xvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at 
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended.

The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.

FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested. 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS

 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1-6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students. 
 
  Teach to the needs of each group of students during guided mathematics activities. 
 
 Integrate mathematics across the curriculum. 
 
 Give tests at the end of a concept or unit.  This will identify students learning and the effectiveness of teacher strategies/practices 
 
 Give post-test at the end of the school year to determine students’ successes.  
 
 Record results from the assessments in teachers’ Mark Book, portfolios, and formal reports. 
 
 Host Mathematics competitions to give students the opportunity to compete with their peers and solidify skills and concepts taught. 
 
 Teacher training/upgrading in mathematics instruction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027

The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment. 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES  


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxvii
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of understanding than those under Understand. 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
  putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
  production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three  distracters.  
 
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, or a 
multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxix
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical 
thinking skills.  Further, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in 
working with timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various 
components of the examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques 
and timed tests/ quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently 
write National Examinations.

   In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                  
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful bay relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life. 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics; 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxxi
 
 
 
 
Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
i. 
Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The 
next day, discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
ii. 
Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
iii. 
Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
iv. 
 Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
v. 
Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
vi. 
Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the    
             most points?); and 
 
    vii.   Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxxii
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can  
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed  
 
delete extraneous information  
 
identify the parts in the question  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information  
 
share student-generated questions  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers   
 
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
**NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

3. Round whole numbers to 
the nearest thousand, 
ten thousand and 
hundred thousand 
(Continued).  
 Rounding is a method used to replace a 
number with another number that tells 
about how many or how much.  
 Rounding Rules 
a. Find the place to which you want to   
round. 
b. Look at the digit to its right. If the 
digit is less than 5, the digit in the 
rounding place stays the same. If the 
digit is 5 or more, the digit in the 
rounding place increases by 1. 
-Note: All digits to the RIGHT of 
the rounding place become zeros. 
All digits to the LEFT of the 
rounding place remain the same. 
 Examples: 
-  Round 374 to the nearest ten.  
a.  Find the rounding place, Tens  
b. Ask: i. What digit do I look at? The 
digit in the ones place -4. 
  ii. Is it less or more than 5? It is less   
than 5. 
        iii. What happens to the digit in the 
ones place? It remains the same-7. 
        iv. What happens to the digit to the left 
of the tens place? It remains the 
same-3. 
 Rounding Riddle 
I am now the number 360 000. I was rounded to the 
nearest ten thousand. I was the number between 352 678 
and 352 680. What number was my original name? 
 - The same principle applies for rounding to the 
nearest ten thousand and hundred thousand.  
 
 Rounding Concentration 
Have two sets of cards: One set with the original 
numbers and the other set with the matching rounded 
numbers. 
 
- Guide students to match pairs of cards and explain 
choice of selection.

3. Round whole numbers to the 
nearest thousand, ten 
thousand and hundred 
thousand. 
  v. What happens to the digit to the right 
of the tens place? It becomes a zero. 
Therefore, 374 rounded to the 
nearest ten is 370.  
 
Round 374 to the nearest hundred 
 
Find the rounding place: hundreds. 
Ask: 
 a. What digit do I look at? The digit in  
the tens place: 7 
 b.   Is it (7) less or more than 5? It is 
more than 5 
 c. What happens to the digit in the 
hundreds place? It increases by 1  
    (3 + 1). 
d. What happens to the digits to the 
right of the hundreds place? They 
become zeros. 
 
Therefore, 374 rounded to the 
nearest hundred is 400. 
 
       - Round 2641 to the nearest thousand. 
To round to the nearest thousand, 
follow the rounding rules. 
Therefore, 2 641 rounded to the 
nearest thousand is 3 000.

9. Compare and order decimal 
through thousandths. 
 
 Use place value. Start at the left. Look 
for the first place where the digits are 
different. 
Example: 0. 472 ; 0. 679 
9 thousandths > 2 thousandths 
0. 6790 > 0.472 
 
 
   
  Use place value to solve word problems 
 
A penny made in 1982 weighs about 
0.129 ounce. A penny made in 2006 
weighs about 0.120 ounce. Which 
penny weighs more, a 1982 or 2006 
penny? 
 
a. Use place value to solve problem.  
0.129  ; 0.120 
- Start at the left. Look for the first place 
where the digits are different. 
9 thousandths > 0 thousandths 
0.129> 0.120 
 
Therefore, a penny made in 1982 weighs 
more than a penny in 2006. 
 
 
Students can also use the hundred grid.

                   56 
               +  21 
 
- Add the ones. Regroup if needed. 
- Add the tens. Regroup if needed. 
 
 Mental-Find the difference 
 
                    36    Think: 36 = 30 + 6 
                 -  25                25 = 20 + 5 
 
-Subtract the tens:-30 – 20 = 10 
-Subtract the ones: 6-5 = 1 
-Add the differences 10 + 1= 11 
Therefore, 36-25 = 11

21.  Explain what a remainder 
means in a division problem 
(Continued). 
 
To divide means to share a number 
of items to find how many equal 
groups can be made or how many 
items will be in each group. 
Sometimes you cannot divide 
numbers or numbers of object 
evenly. 
 
 
REMAINDER is the amount that is 
left over when a number cannot be 
divided evenly.

     6   37 
        - 36 
            1 
- 
Divide 37 by 6 
- Multiply 6 by 6 
- Subtract 36 from 37 
- Compare 1<6 
The quotient is 6 and the remainder 
is 1 
 
NB: The difference must be less than 
the divisor.  
 Interpreting the remainder is a 
necessary skill in solving division 
word problems. 
 
Use counters to show remainders. 
Example: use 20 counters. Draw 6 
circles

23. Estimate addition and 
multiplication up to two digits 
by three digits. 
 There are many ways to estimate like 
using compatible numbers, rounding 
and using front-end estimation.  
 
 Front end estimation 
involves rounding and adding, 
subtracting or multiplying numbers in 
the leftmost place or the very last 
number on the left. 
 
 This means that all numbers in other 
places will be zeros except the 
number in the leftmost place after the 
numbers are rounded

32. Add and subtract fractions and 
mixed numbers with like 
denominators without 
regrouping/renaming.     
 
 When adding like fractions, add only 
the numerators.  The denominator 
remains the same. 
 Example: 1  +  1 =  2  =  1 
                 4       4     4      2 
 You can use addition and subtraction 
basic facts to help you add and subtract 
like fractions. 
 
 
 
 Use fraction bars to add and 
subtract fractions with like 
denominators. 
 
        E.g.: 7/8 – 4/8 = 3/8

        ¼ + 2/4 = ¾  
 
4/10 + 4/10 = 8/10 or 4/5 
 
-Use fraction bars to find 
the difference 
11/12 – 6/12 = 5/12 
33. Explain why like denominators 
are needed in the addition and 
subtraction of fractions.  
  To add and subtract fractions with 
unlike denominators, change to 
equivalent fractions.  
 
 Fractions with unlike denominators 
cannot be added and subtracted unless 
you find the common denominator. 
 
 Without denominators, the number is 
not a fraction. 
 
E.g. 1 + 1    = 2 + 1 = 3 
            2    4       4     4    4

have the same denominator. One half 
is the same as two quarters. 
 
b. Add the numerators together to find 
the answer.

 A rule can be used to describe a 
pattern. 
 When you divide one number by 
another, and have left over, that 
amount is called the remainder. You 
will get remainders when you are 
dividing whole numbers and you 
are not using decimal values. 
Examples: 
5 ÷ 2 = 2 with remainder 1 
7 ÷ 2 = 3 with remainder 1 
5 ÷ 3 = 1 with remainder 2 
5 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 1 (4 + 1) 
6 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 2 (4 + 2) 
7 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 3 (4 + 3) 
9 ÷ 4 = 2 with remainder 1 (4 + 4 +1)  
 
6 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 1 (5 + 1) 
7 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 2 (5 + 2) 
8 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 3 (5 + 3) 
9 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 4 (5 + 4)

c. Teacher instructs students to form 2 
groups and asks, “If you place 30 
students into two groups, how 
many students will be in each 
group?” (15 students) 
d. This continues until as many 
groups as possible can be formed. 
e. Students will eventually predict the 
amount of groups, totals, and 
remainder (patterns).

 In the metric system, millimetres (mm), 
centimetre (cm) ,decimetre (dm), metre 
(m), and kilometre are used to measure 
length and distance. 
 
 Millimetres and centimetres are used 
to measure very short lengths or 
distances. 
 
 A millimetre is about the thickness of a 
coin (penny). 
 
 A centimetre is about the width of 
your index finger. 
 
 Metres and kilometres are used to 
measure much greater length or 
distances. 
 A metre is about the distance from one 
hand to the other when arms are 
stretched out. Your arm span is about 1 
metre long. 
 
 A decimetre is about the width of an 
adult’s hand. A kilometre is a little 
more than half a mile. 
 
 Write four objects that you would 
measure using centimeter, decimeter, 
metre, and kilometer. Estimate the 
lengths and measure the objects. 
 Choose the unit that you would use to 
measure: 
a. your little finger 
b. a five cent coin 
c. the distance between New 
Providence and Eleuthera  
d. the classroom door

17. Read and write time to the      
twenty-four hour clock. 
 The military tells time using a 24-
hour clock, beginning at midnight, 
which is 0000 hours. So, 1:00 a.m. is 
0100 hours, 2:00 a.m. is 0200 hours, 
and so-on up until 11:00 p.m. which 
is 2300 hours. 
  
 A 24-hour clock is an "extension" of 
a 12-hour clock. 
 
 When a 12-hour clock reaches 
12:59 and resets to 1:00, the 24-
hour clock keeps going to 13:00 
and onward. 
 
  The bigger the hour number is on 
the clock, the later it is in any given 
day. 
 
 Subtract 12 from the hour of any 
time past 12:00 on the 24-hour clock 
to find its 12-hour p.m. counterpart. 
For example, 15:34 minus 12 hours 
is 3:34 p.m 
 
 In cooperative groups, students match 
time to 24-hour clock. For example:  
4:00 AM -- 0400 hrs. 
5:00 AM -- 0500 hrs.  
6:00 AM -- 0600 hrs. 
12:00 PM -- 1200 hrs.  
1:00 PM -- 1300 hrs. 
2:00 PM -- 1400 hrs.  
3:00 PM -- 1500 hrs. 
 
 Make a game out of the two clocks set 
up side by side. Cover the 12-hour 
clock with a piece of construction 
paper or fabric and have students guess 
the time on the 12-hour clock, by only 
looking at the 24-hour clock beside it. 
When they have a good grasp of the 
concept, cover the 24-hour clock and 
have the children guess its time based 
on the 12-hour clock

3.   Identify right, acute, and 
obtuse angles.  
 A right angle is a special angle that 
forms a square corner. A right angle 
measures 90˚. 
 
 
Example  
        
           
 
 The measure of some angles is less 
than a right angle. These are acute 
angles. 
 
 
Example 
 
 
 The measure of some angles is 
greater than a right angle. These are 
obtuse angles. 
 
Example  
 
 
 
 
* The unit used to measure an angle is a  
   degree (º ) 
 
 Find angles in the classroom and 
identify them (right, acute, or 
obtuse angle).  
 
 Use pipe cleaners to create angles. 
 
 
Game: What is the Angle? 
       Play the game with a partner 
a. One student selects a flash 
card and identifies the type of 
angle. If he/she gets it correct, 
he/she will get the point. If 
not, a point is not received.  
 
b. The game is finished when all 
the cards have been used. The 
person with the most points is

sliding one foot in a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal motion and then 
moving the other foot to join it). 
b. A flip (facing one direction, then doing 
a 180 jump to face the opposite 
direction), or a turn (one foot stays in 
place and we rotate 90 degrees for each 
foot...kind of like a pivot in basketball). 
I am the "caller" for the dance and they 
complete the movements as I call them 
out randomly.

1. Graph data on a line graph. 
 Information about people or things is 
called data.  Data can be collected and 
organized in different ways. 
 A line graph connects points to show 
how data changes over time. 
 
 
  The scale consists of numbers that 
show the units used on a graph. 
 The interval is the amount between 
tick marks on the scale. 
 Students collect data; then show data 
on line graph. Example:  Number of 
bicycles that was sold for seven 
months (January – July) or the 
temperature recorded for one week etc. 
 Give graphs a title, scale, and labels.  
Talk about the data collected then 
show how to place points on the grid 
for each number in the table.  Connect 
the points to make the line. 
 Analyze line graphs through 
discussion.  
Example: 
a. Does a line graph have a scale? 
b. Does a line graph show a range? 
c. Does a line graph show a mode? 
d. Can you make prediction based on

 A bar graph uses bars to show data.  
  Samples such as surveys and inventories 
are used to collect data. In a vertical bar 
graph, the bars go up from the bottom. In 
a horizontal bar graph, the bars go across 
from the left. 
 Line graphs show data change over time. 
 NOTE: Do not confuse bar graphs and 
histograms. The bars in bar graphs do not 
touch but in a histogram they do.

 
To estimate the average/ mean of a 
set of data, use the compensation 
strategy for addition. 
 
Compensation in math means, 
adding and subtracting the same 
number to make the sum or 
difference easier to find. 
  Guide students to estimate 
averages. Use numbers that can 
be easily adjusted.  
Example: 3,  5,  4 
Take 1 from 5, which is 4. Add 
the 1 from the 5 to 3 to make 4. 
You will get 
   4, 4, 4 
The mean is 4

backside of “n” apples. Place the apples in 
a bag where students alternately pull an 
apple from the bag. If students pull a 
“good” apple out of the bag, he/she 
remains in the game. If a rotten apple is 
pulled, the student is out. When all the 
apples are removed, the students will write 
probabilities for good and rotten apples. 
8.  Write probability as a 
fraction or ratio. 
 A ratio is a comparison 
between two or more 
quantities. 
 
 There are several ways of 
writing the probability. You

SCIENCE
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit

PREFACE 
 
We live in a world that is scientifically and technologically oriented – a world of phenomenal scientific advancement and innovations. As The Bahamas 
keeps pace with this advancement, our children must be exposed to effective, comprehensive Science Education early in life. We must take advantage of their 
innate curiosity and zeal for learning about the environment before it diminishes. 
 
Science is important because it links to technology and industry, which are areas of priority for a country’s development. Science provides ways of 
making sense of the world systemically. Opportunities must be provided for our children to experience science at an early age. It is important for them 
to understand scientific ways of thinking and to have adequate knowledge of science if they are to keep pace with the technological advances and 
innovations of the 21st Century. 
 
The production of the revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines consisted of local educators who accepted the challenge of producing this document 
– a third document for the Department of Education: Science Unit (August 2001, June 2010, and December 2021). The Production Team has ensured that 
the purposes of developing sciences are met. A few of these aims are to communicate, to relate science to everyday life, and to explore, apply and 
investigate scientific and technological knowledge and ideas. 
 
In accomplishing these aims, instructional facilitators will guide students through the use of various communication modes, developing their awareness of 
the importance of science in life. Students will be encouraged to make decisions based on their knowledge of science and issues such as personal health and 
well-being, safety and the preservation of the environment. These students will be able to appreciate that experimentation is not judged by success or failure, 
but by the knowledge, which is gained from the process. 
 
The revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines grades 1-6 boasts several new features. The previous Primary Curriculum consisted of three stands; we 
introduced a fourth strand –  “Environmental Science.” More focus was given to the integration of technological skills in developing the basic concepts, skills 
and activities in the Life, Earth, Physical and Environmental Sciences. Also noteworthy in the document are the deliberate efforts to highlight skills and 
attitudes that we wish for our students to develop. 
 
When the guidelines in this revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines are effectively implemented, they will ensure that our students have the 
foundation of basic scientific concepts and principles that develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge necessary for them to successfully work and live 
in the 21st Century.

PRIMARY SCIENCE MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Primary Science Unit recognizes the place of science in everyday human affairs and aim for scientific literacy that is operational in understanding 
oneself. We seek to provide a level of understanding and scientific literacy that will prepare students to be informed and participative citizens who are able to 
make judgments and decisions regarding science applications that may have social, health or environmental impacts. 
 
 
 
BROAD OBJECTIVES 
 
The team responsible for effecting the necessary revisions to the Primary Science Curriculum holds the view that the curriculum should achieve two 
broad objectives: 
 Provide courses of study that challenge participants to acquire scientific skills and academic standards consistent with emerging global 
workforce requisites while simultaneously promoting self-confidence, character strengthening, creativity and personal initiative. 
 Improve the use of technology in the teaching/learning process. 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 
 
To provide opportunities that expose and engage students in The Bahamas in acquiring scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes which will enhance 
critical thinking, problem-solving and organizational skills. In so doing, students will be able to participate in varied scientific and technological 
careers in the global environment, as well as realize the impact that they make on the natural world and appreciate the need for its sustainability.

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

 
Animals have special 
features called adaptations 
that allow them to live 
where they do. 
 
An animal adaptation is a 
body part, a body covering 
or an action (behaviour) 
that helps the animal to 
survive  in its environment. 
 
Camouflage and mimicry 
are animal adaptations. 
Many small animals use 
these adaptations to avoid 
being eaten by other 
animals. 
 
Mimicry is an adaption in 
which an animal looks and 
sounds like another animal. 
For example, some 
harmless animals look and 
behave like poisonous 
animals that are distasteful 
to predators who avoid 
eating them.

(toys/figures). Have students 
volunteer to choose an animal 
from the display. Each student 
will be asked a question related 
to an adaptation the animal 
has. 
E.g. Why does the giraffe have 
a long neck? Draw conclusions 
and discuss.

of the 
Respiratory 
System and

is transported 
throughout the 
human body. 
 
The respiratory system is 
a group of organs that 
transports air into the body. 
 
When we breathe, air 
moves through the nose or 
mouth and goes down the 
windpipe, also known as 
the trachea. 
 
The trachea divides into 
two tubes called the 
bronchial tubes. The 
bronchial tubes carry air 
into our lungs. 
 
The human body has two 
lungs. In the lungs the 
bronchial tubes divide into 
smaller tubes.

Tiny air sacs called alveoli 
are found at the end of the 
smallest tubes.

 
When air enters the lungs, 
it fills the air sacs. Oxygen 
moves from the air sacs 
into the lungs. 
 
At the same time, carbon 
dioxide moves from the 
blood to the air sacs. When 
you breathe out, carbon 
dioxide leaves the body. 
 
The diaphragm is a dome- 
shaped muscle used in 
breathing. It is at the 
bottom of the lungs. 
 
The diaphragm flattens or 
tightens (contracts) when 
we breathe air in (inhale). 
This action pulls air into 
the lungs. 
 
To breathe out or exhale, 
the diaphragm goes back to 
its normal shape and 
pushes air out of your 
lungs.

 
Germination is defined as 
the beginning of growth. 
The term is most commonly 
associated with plants, 
describing the process of a 
seed sprouting into a 
seedling. The term 
germination can also be 
applied to spores or buds. 
 
When seeds are dry and 
hard, they are dormant. 
 
When a seed is moistened, 
it will absorb water, 
breaking the seed coat and 
initiating the food supply in 
the cotyledon. 
 
Temperatures must fall 
between a specific range for 
seeds to germinate. 
 
Sunlight supports the 
germination process as it 
provides warmth to the soil.

 
Sunlight warms the soil to 
help initiate germination 
and once leaves have 
sprouted, it is also the 
primary energy source for 
plant growth through the 
process of photosynthesis. 
 
The developing stem will 
bring the cotyledon along, 
which appears as the first 
two sprouting leaves, which 
looks different than the true 
leaves of the plant that grow 
once the stem and roots are 
established.

 Waves are the 
alternating rising and

 Waves are caused by the 
wind. Wind blowing over 
the surface of the ocean 
transfers energy to the 
water and causes waves to 
form. 
 Tides are the alternate 
rise and fall of the oceans 
and seas and bodies of 
water connected to them. 
 Tides are caused by the 
gravitational force of the 
moon acting on the oceans 
and seas. 
 Ocean water tilts back and 
forth because of the 
gravitational pull of the 
moon, which causes a 
high tide and a low tide 
each day.

multiplying the 
amount of force used 
to move the object by 
the distance that the 
object moves.

 People use machines to do 
work. Machines make tasks 
easier and faster to do. 
 A simple machine is a 
device that has few or no 
moving parts. 
 The six kinds of simple 
machines are the lever, 
pulley, screw, wheel and 
axle, wedge and inclined 
plane. 
 An inclined plane is a flat 
surface that is higher on one 
end than the other. It is a 
simple machine - for 
example, a ramp, a slide, a 
slanted road, and a step. 
 An inclined plane is used to 
lift an object while using 
less force.

1. Exploring Simple Machines 
Working in pairs, use string to 
attach a toy car or other object to a 
spring scale. Make a ramp by 
propping up one end of a smooth 
board on the seat of a chair. 
Place the toy car at the bottom of 
the board. Slowly pull the car to 
the board at a steady rate. As one 
person pulls, the other person can 
read the force on the spring scale. 
Record it. Measure the distance the 
car was pulled up the board. 
Record it.

 Identify 4 
kinds of 
mangroves. 
 Explain the 
function of 
wetlands. 
Mangroves are ecosystems found 
along the coast and in wetlands. They 
live in brackish and salt water. The 
four common types of mangroves 
found locally are red mangroves, 
black mangroves, white mangroves 
and buttonwood. Each type of 
mangrove has a special role play in 
the ecosystem. 
Red Mangroves grow in water along 
the shoreline. They have thick prop 
roots that trap debris and mud. They 
help to prevent waves from flowing 
too far inland, which reduces flooding 
in coastal communities and further 
inland. 
Black Mangroves grow in shallower 
salty water. They are surrounded by 
thin breathing roots.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method 
❖ 
Cooperative Learning Technique

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence;

Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps: 
 
PROBLEM   
HYPOTHESIS 
PREDICTIONS 
TEST OF PREDICTIONS 
EVALUATION OF HYPOTHESIS

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere. 


332 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and 
teachers. As the internet is constantly changing, some websites may become non-functional, outdated or unsuitable.

An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

I. “OWL STRATEGY” 
Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic.

VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.

PREFACE 
The Primary Social Studies Curriculum Guidelines reflect the 10 strands and the standards of the National Council of Social Studies.  The curriculum is 
designed to meet the needs of a diverse student population and lends itself to differentiated instruction.  Hence, the Primary Social Studies Curriculum is 
designed to ensure that students are equipped with the necessary knowledge, attitudes and skills that are required for the 21st century.  These skills are referred 
to as the ‘four Cs’.  They are the skills of ‘critical thinking’, ‘communication’, ‘collaboration’ and ‘creativity’.   
Social Studies is inclusive of different areas of study, ranging from History and Geography to Civics and Economics, among others as comprised in this 
document.  It is important that students at the varying grade levels are exposed to the various aspects of Social Studies in order to provide the essential 
prerequisites necessary for effective spiraling of content and skills. 
The appendix comprises of culturally relevant suggestions for integration and the interconnections of content and topics, ring plays, Bahamian songs, teacher- 
created jingles, suggested virtual assessment tools, apps, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Preamble of the Constitution of the 
Commonwealth of The Bahamas, a rubric for assessing students’ projects, suggested field experiences and websites as well the various maps to use to ensure 
that the teaching of geography is strategic.  
The Primary Social Studies and Tourism Education for The Bahamas, levels one through six, and the School Atlas for the Commonwealth of The Bahamas are 
the required texts for the teaching of Primary Social Studies.  These texts were written by Bahamian educators in conjunction with Hodder Education, (formerly 
Pearson) and are designed with and inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning with suggested activities and strategies to engage the learner.  The 
document allows for additional resources to be used to supplement the instructional programme in order to remain culturally relevant and current in an ever-
changing society and world. 
It is believed that this document will facilitate in the content being relevant, engaging, meaningful and enduring as the experiences are grounded on the national 
standards of Social Studies.

SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief 
systems, such as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and 
beliefs? What does language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, 
sociology and anthropology, as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one 
to develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? 
How has the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme 
typically appears in courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things 
located? Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have 
for people? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to 
adulthood? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are 
maintained or changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by 
institutions? How do institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses 
dealing with sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science and history.  
 
 
Power, Authority  
Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is 
power? What form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, 


11 | P a g e  
structured, maintained and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically 
appears in units and courses dealing with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of 
the factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic 
concepts and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is 
new technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which 
is unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people 
benefit from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural 
and physical sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, 
civics and government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme 
typically appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and 
the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. 
Students confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the 
balance between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world 
community? How can I make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, 
cultural anthropology and fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

All independent nations display 
their countries independence 
through their flag, national 
anthem and coat of arms.  In 
1973, The Bahamas became an 
independent nation.  Timothy 
Gibson composed the national 
anthem of our country. It begins 
by asking us to hold our heads 
high as a Bahamian people.  We 
are reminded of our place in the 
world as an independent nation.  
Our national anthem encourages 
us to set goals and move steadily 
toward them.  It explains that we 
can only excel as a nation through 
love, unity and recognizing our 
God.   
 After reciting the pledge 
discuss what it means to you 
 
 Create a classroom pledge 
identifying a goal you as

National Bird, Fish, and other 
symbols that are indigenous to 
our country.  The conch shell and 
the Blue Marlin fish identify the 
marine life, palms represent the 
flora, the Santa Maria represents 
the arrival of Christopher 
Columbus, and the sun represents 
the natural resources. At the base

Rev. Dr. Philip Rahming wrote 
the national pledge of The 
Bahamas. The national pledge of 
The Bahamas identifies us as a 
people, Bahamians, it entreats us 
to be loyal and live by the ideals 
of our nation.  Although divided 
by waters, the pledge also 
suggests that we are one under

The Eleutheran Adventurers, after 
they landed in The Bahamas, 
named the island the landed on, 
Eleuthera, and settled there. Life 
on the island was not easy so the 
group began to trade wood for 
supplies, as farming was not an 
option.  Eventually, Captain Sayle 
left Eleuthera and moved to an 
island he called Sayle Island which 
was later renamed Providence.  
We now call this island New 
Providence.  These people began 
the practice of trading and 
salvaging things from wrecked 
ships. As more people came to the 
island, the Eleutheran Adventurers 
established settlements both on   
Eleuthera and New Providence 
islands. 
 Research origins of the names 
of various places in Eleuthera 
and New Providence that date

Plantation is a large area of land 
where crops are grown. 
By the 1780s, the United States 
was no longer an English colony. 
The Loyalists were a group of men 
who wanted to continue to be loyal 
to the king of England. Therefore, 
they left, the now independent 
America and travelled to The 
Bahamas that was still a British 
colony at that time. 
The Loyalists established cotton 
plantations on the family islands.  
These plantations comprised of a 
house, large fields and slaves.  
Large amounts of cotton were 
exported to America and in the off 
seasons, slaves were made to rake 
salt from the pans. 
 
 Construct a model of a loyalist 
plantation. 
 
 Reenact a day in the life of 
various people of that time e.g.

From the 16th to 19th 
centuries Africans were shipped to 
the New World as part of 
the Atlantic slave trade. Ships 
departed Europe for African 
markets with manufactured goods, 
which were traded for purchased 
or kidnapped Africans, who were 
transported across the Atlantic as 
slaves. The slaves were then sold 
or traded for raw materials, which 
would be transported back to 
Europe to complete the voyage. 
Slaves in The Bahamas came via 
different routes. Some came direct 
from Africa enduring the middle 
passage. The middle passage was a 
perilous part of the voyage. Some 
slaves also came with the Loyalists 
from America.

There are four intermediate points. 
They are north -west, north- east, 
south-west and south -east.   
Scale models and drawings are 
smaller than the real thing. In this 
way they fit on a page or a sheet of 
paper and can be carried or stored 
easily. A scale tells you the size or 
a plan, map or drawing or model 
compared with what it represents.    
Lines of latitude and longitude 
help us to locate places on a map. 
The islands of The Bahamas are 
located between latitude 20°N and 
latitude 28°N and longitude 72°W

The Bahamas has many natural 
resources. In the past, sisal and 
sponging were the main resources 
used to build the economy.  
Today, we also produce food items 
for consumption and export. 
Food items grown or caught

These rich people travelled to The 
Bahamas for winter (winter 
residents). Tourists at this time 
stayed in hotels with electricity 
and plumbing.  
In the 1950s tourism became a 
business. Sir Stafford Sands, the 
Father of Tourism, was in charge 
of the Development Board. He 
aimed to increase visitor arrival 
and make tourism a year round 
business. He encouraged hotels to 
install air-conditioning.  Gambling 
was legalized and casinos were 
built in Nassau, New Providence 
and in Freeport, Grand Bahama.  
A massive advertising campaign

From 1969 to 1979, a market 
research was implemented. It was 
used to improve tourism through 
staff training, courtesy campaigns 
and the planning of new tourism 
programmes in hotels.  
Tourism is the number one 
industry in The Bahamas. Most of 
The Bahamas’ revenue is obtained 
from tourism and many citizens 
are employed in this sector. 
There are many different kinds of 
jobs in the tourism industry. 
Some of the jobs in the tourism 
industry include; The Ministry of 
Tourism, marketing and

The history of the people who 
came to The Bahamas plays an 
important part in defining who we 
are as a people. It is this heritage 
that enables us to trace the origin 
of many of our names back to 
slavery or Loyalists times. 
Certain islands tend to have 
particular family names based on 
how the island was settled by the 
people who went there. One can 
often tell which island a person is 
from based on their surname.  
It takes a long time and many 
people to build a nation. Nation 
builders ensure that our country 
thrives and is strong. These people 
lead in many different fields and 
make significant contributions.

Holiday  
 
 
Whit Monday is a religious 
holiday celebrated after Pentecost.  
It is a movable feast in 
the Christian calendar because it is 
determined by the date of Easter.  
It gets its English name from 
'Whitsun' or 'Whit Sunday'. 
 
On Randol Fawkes Labour Day, 
Bahamians take time to reflect on 
the efforts made by thousands of 
people in the 20th century to help 
bring equality and better labour 
standards to the country. Workers 
march through the streets to show 
worker solidarity and to draw 
attention to the current struggles of 
workers. The day also recognizes 
the efforts of men like Randol 
Fawkes the ‘father’ of the labour 
movement in The Bahamas.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas.MaryIngraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 
 


xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirationsand feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

It is the oldest sport being played here, 
In the roads, playground or fields. 
 
What is Cricket?

During the 70s the game declined, 
Because teachers did not know the game. 
They taught track and field and other sports, 
Which buried the cricket name.

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies could be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.   
 
 
The following example indicates how the curriculum objectives are number:

steadfast love and mercies 
never cease (Lam. 3:22-23).

ways to honour God’s

There are many ways in 
which we can honour God’s

faithfulness.  
Because God is love, we 
should show His love to 
others in our words and 
actions (1 John 4:7-8).  We 
should 
honour 
God’s 
faithfulness by being faithful 
in 
praying,

1.1. C.4.1. Discover that 
God is omnipresent, 
omniscient and eternal 
 
 
Christians use words such as 
omnipresent, omniscient and 
eternal to describe the nature 
or 
attributes 
of 
God.  
Omnipresent 
means 
that 
God is everywhere. Heaven is 
His dwelling place but His 
presence 
can 
be 
felt 
throughout 
the 
Earth.  
Omniscient means that He is

2.2. A.4.1. Explain 
that worship should 
be done reverently 
and sincerely 
Worship expresses a person’s 
reverence for God and it should 
be done sincerely.  According 
to Jesus, some people worship 
God “with their lips” but not with 
their hearts (Matt. 15:8-9).  
Christians must have honest 
and sincere hearts when they 
worship God.  Our hearts 
should be clean and our spirits 
free (Ps. 51:10).

Christians believe that a part of 
their purpose in life is to serve 
others.  To serve means “to give 
assistance or help.”  Jesus 
Christ said if someone wants to 
be great, he/she must be the 
“servant of the rest” (Matt. 
20:26).  When Christians serve, 
they express the love of God 
within them and place the needs 
of others first.

an example of how they should 
serve others.

person is physically sick, this 
may affect his/her emotions.  
When 
something 
challenging 
happens like sickness or death of 
a family member, a person may 
lack energy and feel sad.  When 
you exercise, your body and

family relationships 
 
The Bible gives us examples of 
healthy and unhealthy family 
relationships.  In the story, “The 
Baby who Survived,” we have 
an example of a supportive 
family.  Moses’ family members 
worked together to save his life. 
He grew up with love and 
support. 
 
In the story of “Cain and Abel,” 
we see an example of jealousy 
among brothers that led to 
murder. 
 
Cain’s 
behaviour 
disrupted his family and caused 
evil to spread on the Earth.

4.1. D.4.1. Examine the 
significance of the 
resurrection for 
Christians 
 
The resurrection of Jesus 
Christ is very significant to the 
Christian faith.  If Jesus was 
not risen from the dead, then 
the believer’s faith is not real 
and he/she is still in sin (1 Cor. 
15:17).  Jesus was victorious 
over 
death; 
therefore, 
all 
believers can have eternal life.

The resurrection gives hope to 
believers that one day they will 
rise from the dead.  The 
physical body that dies will be 
raised as a spiritual body that 
lives forever.  Death will be 
destroyed forever.  Christians 
will go to heaven to be with

The way individuals behave 
will cause them to 
experience good or bad 
consequences.  When we 
follow rules at home, 
school or in the wider 
community, we get rewards 
such as verbal praise and 
treats.  When we disobey 
rules, we are punished and 
privileges are taken away.   
 
In the wider community, if 
people break laws, they 
can pay a fine or even go 
to jail. 
These consequences are 
very serious.

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that 
will equip them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by 
Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They 
are respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as 
that state of well-being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of 
all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human 
development. This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration 
with Government Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will 
include sensitization and training for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit 
will coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, 
substance abuse prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage 
pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be 
conducted to address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles 
through training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. Life is the most valuable, natural possession to be nurtured and protected at all times by everyone. 
 
2. The stabilization of family is the key to the management of most of the social problems. 
 
3. Health is essential to the well-being of all individuals. 
 
4. Academic achievement and student health and well-being are inextricably linked. 
 
5. HFLE, with its emphasis on prevention and multi-disciplinary approaches, has the potential to address many of the social problems and 
impact behaviors and lifestyles. 
 
6. HFLE aims to address the whole child and to nurture emotional, physical, mental and moral development. It takes into account both 
affective and cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome. 
 
8. HFLE is the means by which positive values, attitudes and behaviors, knowledge and skills can be taught. The core skills, which the 
young develop within HFLE, can be translated into all areas of their lives. 
 
9. HFLE creates an atmosphere of trust, openness, sincerity and honesty, which contributes to positive interpersonal relationships. 
 
10. HFLE draws heavily on the experiences of students and educators and deals with young people in the context of home, school and 
community relationships.  
 
11. HFLE produces individuals who, cognizant of their roles in society, will make a positive contribution to national, regional and 
international development.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in 
learning, the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the 
development of individuals and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many 
important social, cultural and health issues in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown 
that confident, well-informed and well-supported young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the 
lifelong acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In 
order for individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address 
issues and risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs), HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse 
and drug dealing, negative sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, 
Sexuality and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is 
interrelated and has been developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary

Traits are the physical characteristics or 
qualities (mental, emotional and social) 
that make a person special. 
 
Traits can be inherited and acquired. 
Inherited traits are passed on to individuals 
from their parents e.g. the ability to play a 
musical instrument, being great in sports, 
being good in a foreign language, etc.  
 
Acquired traits are characteristics that 
people develop as a result of life 
experiences and engaging in activities over 
time. One might become a skilled player 
because they acquired an interest in the 
activity and practiced until they perfected 
it.  
 
Individual interests, skills and talents make 
a person unique or different from others.  
Complete a self-inventory identifying their interests and 
hobbies. Share findings with the class.

A disability is a mental or physical condition that prevents the 
body from working, as it should.  
 
People have different forms of disabilities. 
- Physical disabilities include: blindness, deafness, speech 
defects, paralysis (cripple), etc. 
- Emotional disturbances and mental retardation are forms of 
mental disabilities.  
 
A disability is not a disease that can be spread to another 
person.   
 
People who have disabilities want to be treated with respect, 
care and understanding. 
 
They also want to be independent and do as much for 
themselves as they can. 
 
Good citizens see disabilities as opportunities to learn more 
about people and their challenges. 
Level 1: Compile a list of ways they 
can show respect toward others. Share 
their lists with classmates.  
 
Level 2: Create posters promoting 
ways to be more caring to people who 
are different from them.  
 
Level 3: Interview someone in the 
school or community who is disabled.

Friends meet human physical, emotional and 
social needs for love, support and to belong to a 
group.  
 
Friends share the same feelings, goals, values 
and interests. Young people usually make new 
friends as their interests change.  
 
Friendships vary. Some friendships last a 
lifetime, some last only a day or two.   
 
Making and keeping friends take practice.  
 
Advice from friends can be good or bad. 
Individuals are responsible for the 
choices/decisions that they make in life. 
Therefore, it is important for individuals to 
choose friends that will encourage them to make 
wise choices.    
Level 1: Compile a list some clubs, groups, classes or 
teams in your community that a student might join to 
find new friends

Using illegal drugs can prevent you from doing well in school and 
sports.  They can stop you from caring about family, friends and 
important things.  These actions hurt everybody around you

Protection from abuse  
Any form of abuse is against the law and should be reported.  
 
Article 34 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child provides protection from any form of sexual abuse.   
 
It is important to report sexual abuse to a trusted adult. 
Always say ‘NO’, get away and seek help.  Reporting these 
abuses also raises awareness about pedophiles in the 
community. 
 
Sometimes, it is okay for others to touch private parts e.g. 
parents, doctors or nurses sometimes need to touch private 
parts when they take care of you or examine you for health 
reasons.  
 
Most touching done by adults is good touching, but children 
need to know what to do when someone touches private 
parts inappropriately. Children should not keep 
‘inappropriate touching’ secret. 
Level 1. Create a slogan, bumper 
sticker or flyer to demonstrate

A sexually transmitted infection (STI), also know as sexually transmitted 
disease or venereal disease (VD) is an infection that is spread through sexual 
contact. Anyone who has sexual contact with another person is at risk of 
getting an STI. 
 
Some common STIs are: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis (Bad Blood), 
Genital Herpes, Hepatitis B and HIV.  
 
Many STIs can be cured with medicines; some have no cure. Genital Herpes 
and HIV do not have a cure. Treatment for Genital Herpes with an antiviral 
drug makes outbreaks less severe. Drug treatment for HIV improves the 
quality of life and survival time for patients. 
 
Common Symptoms of STIs 
- Sore, blisters or swelling around the penis or vagina 
- A burning feeling when passing urine 
- Unusual liquid comes out of the vagina or penis. It is sometimes smelly  
 
A person can have an STI and not notice any signs. You cannot tell who has 
an STI or HIV by looking at them. 
Level 1: Describe how 
STIs are spread and list 
some symptoms and 
treatment.

Choosing foods that contain nutrients and in the right 
proportions is important to maintaining good health and 
preventing diseases.  
 
Special Nutrients (Micronutrients) 
Minierals such as vitamins, minerals and water are classified as 
micronutrients nutrients because they are needed in small 
amounts in the body. 
 
Vitamins are nutrients that help the body do certain jobs.  
- Vitamin A prevents infection, keeps the eyes moist and the 
hair and skin shiny  
- Vitamin C prevents infection, keeps the skin healthy and 
heals wounds. It also helps the body absorb iron.  
- Vitamin D keeps bones and teeth strong. This vitamin is also 
produced by the sun. 
- Vitamin E slows down cell damage 
- Vitamin K controlls blood clotting 
Level 1: Identify special nutrients that 
the body needs for good health.

 EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
The Food Guide Drum and Dietary Guidelines reflect both 
the culture and food choices relevant to The Bahamas *  
 
The Dietary Guidelines show how many servings an 
individual should eat from each food group each day.  
 
A serving is a standard amount food recommended for a 
meal or snack.  It is used to give advice about how much 
to eat or to identify how many calories and nutrients are in 
a food.  
 
A portion is the amount of food an individual chooses to 
eat. There is no standard portion size. A portion may 
contain more than one serving.   
 
It is important to control portion sizes to maintain a 
healthy and balanced diet. Always use serving sizes as a 
guide when selecting foods.  
Level 1: Explain the difference between 
food servings and portion size.  
 
Level 2: Explain why it is important to 
control portion size.  
 
Level 3: Conduct a survey of the portion 
size served by the school lunch 
programme.  
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
Have students demonstrate the correct 
serving size for various food items.  
 
Organize foods from each of the food 
groups to create a balanced meal for 
breakfast, lunch or dinner.  
Illustrate a serving from each food group.

APPENDIX II 
 
 
TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices; and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, 
values and attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. 
However, teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit 
grades which will contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. 
(sharing thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills) 
• Field trips 
• Internships 
• Community Services 
 
Assessment Procedures 
 
Students are assessed based on the following: 
 
Class work and Homework   
60% 
 
Projects and Portfolios  
 
40%

Health and Family Life Education Resource / Information Centre 
 
Each classroom should have a resource or information centre in which information on health issues and students’ work are displayed. Health 
and Family Life materials and activities can also be incorporated into the learning centres in primary schools. 
 
Listed are some suggested resources that will make Health and Family Life Education classes more interactive and interesting: 
 
• Computer Software 
• Transparencies on health issues   
• Games and Puzzles  
• Reality dolls 
• Puppets 
• Posters / Charts 
• Videos, DVDs and Audio Cassette tapes on health issues 
• Pamphlets  
• Brochures  
• Guest Speakers  
• Media sources  
 
Health and Family Life Education Services 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit provides the following services in New Providence and the Family Islands. 
 
• Workshop and sensitization sessions for teachers, parents, students and the public 
• Resources on health issues 
• Peer leadership training 
• HIV Prevention and Basic First Aid training  
 
Partnerships 
 
The Health and Family Education Unit collaborates with parents, school personnel, Government and Non-Government organizations to provide 
wholesome programmes for students. These activities are designed to help them gain the required knowledge, skills, values and attitudes so that 
they will graduate from the education system as fully functioning, self-confident, responsible individuals.

APPENDIX III 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will 
be time for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, 
role play, games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication, 
negotiation, assertiveness and cooperation. 
 
12. Ensure that grades are recorded in the mark book for the topics taught (date, topic, and number grade) 
 
13. Establish interactive learning centres in the classroom which should include current teaching aids and samples of students’ activities.  
 
14. Create instructional and motivational bulletin boards/charts that reflect the concepts and skills being taught e.g. family patterns, body parts, 
hygiene, drug abuse prevention, conflict resolution, HIV, AIDS STIs,  nutrition, environment issues, self esteem, teamwork, etc.

This curriculum has been developed to assist in the dissemination of Physical Education activities and techniques.  It is hoped that this curriculum will assist all 
practitioners of the subject, especially our colleagues in the Family Islands, to improve their delivery of the subject.  It has been said that “the greatest gift that can be given, 
is the gift of knowledge” (author unknown). 
 
It is the hope of all of the professionals who assisted in the compilation of this work, that it will be a source of inspiration and a valuable tool in the tool-box of knowledge 
and instruction to all Physical Education instructors.

RATIONALE 
 
Physical Education is the nucleus of healthy lifestyles and caters significantly to the physically educated citizens. 
It is through this medium that an invaluable learning experience unfolds, allowing all learners to access the knowledge, skills and attitudes that shape their lives through 
this active learning process. 
 
This process of learning embraces the values placed on life and secures each individual in his personal experiences, as these experiences coincide with the stream of things, 
both cognitive and physical in every pursuit. 
 
We must continue to be cognizant of the fact that the needs and experiences of our youth must not be ignored in our planning, for it is through their experiences and 
enjoyment of movement that they will find Physical Education enjoyable.  Regular physical activity is pertinent to the development of the “whole man “.  For children, it is 
through this kind of physical activity and movements that they zoom in on their lives as a whole, critical to all aspects of their development, including the psychomotor, 
cognitive and affective domains.  Therefore, the well-being of individuals depends greatly on the soundness of the Physical Education programme. 
 
In the structured Physical Education programme, consideration must be given to the level of safety of the learners, so as to provide a nurturing environment that would 
enable the development of functional levels of activity, including specific motor skills and functional physical fitness.  The learners Physical Education experiences and 
development must be geared towards appropriate values, personal and social behaviors. 
 
In summary, each individual learner should be progressively assessed in order that their needs are met, providing the opportunity for all to partake in these unique 
experiences equally. 
 
It must therefore be observed, that Physical Education should not be confused with the activities of private sports clubs, sports organizations, or inter-school athletic 
competitions, because these function only to complement this process.  Physical Education is a structured well-balance programme which provides the physically educated 
persons with exciting experience from the knowledge of its nature, skills and developed positive attitudes from its practice; engendering daily routines and leisure pursuits 
through life. 
 
A well-structured and vibrant physical education programme is essential in our Nation as we are in pursuit of excellence.  This active learning will foster personal growth of 
the individual through Physical Education, therefore enhancing the skills necessary to meet the challenges of an ever-changing society. 
 
Thus, an investment in the Physical Education of our children is an investment in the long-term health and prosperity of our Bahama land for years to come.

PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
 
The new direction of Physical Education at Primary level is to provide all students with a safe, enjoyable and nurturing environment where physical activity and the 
development of motor skills will be enhanced.  Each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her potential through the acquisition of knowledge, and skills 
that will transfer to a healthy lifestyle and lifelong sports.  The base of the Physical Programme is Body Management Competence, which gives focus to the development of 
fundamental skills that lead into specialized skills training.  Primary students will also participate in the core sports such as Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, Soccer 
and Track and Field.   Interschool competitions take place in all of the “core sports” aforementioned including, Mini- tennis.  It is the responsibility of the New Providence 
Primary School Sports Association in collaboration with the Department of Education and the various Sports Factions to organize and conduct the competitions, 
reinforcing the principles of fair play, sportsmanship and self-control.

CONTENT STANDARDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
1. Demonstrates competency and proficiency in movement forms. 
The intent of this standard is to develop competence and proficiency in movement.  In preparation for adulthood, students should have acquired the basic skills to 
participate in a wide variety of leisure and work- related physical activities and advance in at least two or three areas. 
 
2. Apply movement concept and principles to learning and development of motor skills. 
This standard concerns the ability of the learner to use cognitive information to understand and enhance motor skills.  By graduation the student should have developed 
sufficient knowledge and ability to independently use their learned behavior to acquire new skills while continuing to refine existing ones. 
 
3. Exhibits physically active lifestyles. 
The intent of this standard is to establish patterns of regular participation in meaningful physical activity.  This standard should connect what was done in physical 
education classes with the lives of students outside of class. 
4. Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 
This standard is for the student to achieve a health-enhancing level of physical fitness.  Student should be encouraged to develop higher levels of basic fitness and 
physical competence as needed for many work situations and active leisure participation.  Students should have both the ability and the willingness to accept 
responsibility for personal fitness leading to an active, healthy lifestyle. 
 
5. Demonstrates responsible personal and social behaviors in physical activity settings. 
Achievement of this standard includes safe practices, adherence to rules and procedure, etiquette, cooperation and teamwork, and positive social interaction. 
 
6. Show respect for differences among people in physical activity settings. 
The intent of this standard is to develop respect for individual similarities and differences through positive interaction among participants in physical activity.  
Similarities and differences include characteristics of culture, ethnicity, motor performance, disabilities, physical characteristics (strength, size, and shape), gender, race 
and socioeconomic status.  
 
7. Recognize that physical activity opportunities are for enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. 
As a result of these intrinsic benefits of participation, students will begin to actively pursue lifelong physical activities that meet their own needs.

SPRINTS 
- 
Sprinting ranges from the short 50 meters 
to the long sprint of 400 meters.  
Sprinting consists of two basic principles: 
stride length and stride speed.  There are 
three parts of effective sprinting: the start, 
efficient running form, and the finish.  
Each of these basic parts of the total 
sprint effort has essential demands.  
Sprinting form is a very individual matter 
because of differences in body builds. 
However, fundamental running 
movements can be described in general 
terms of correct foot placement, arm 
action, shoulder and head angles, body 
alignment, and leg and knee action. 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Emphasize the toes pointing straight 
ahead for efficient running. 
 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms are used for balance 
- 
Fingers should be relaxed 
- 
The arm moves driving the elbow 
forward and back, never passing higher 
than the armpit on the forward swing and 
never further than six inches beyond the 
hips. 
Read “Track and Field,” pg. 48 from the 
Physical Education Theory Workbook,

- 
Arms never cross the midline of the body. 
 
BODY ALIGNMENT 
- 
The runner should rise up on his or her 
toes and lean forward to where a position 
of balance is barely maintained; that is the 
correct body angle.  Forward angle is best 
when accelerating. 
 
 
SHOULDERS 
- 
The shoulder should be relaxed with little 
or no rotation. 
 
HEAD 
- 
The head should be straight ahead with 
eyes focused on the finish line. 
- 
The face (jaws and facial muscles) should 
be relaxed. 
 
 
LEG ACTION AND KNEE LIFT 
- 
Knees should be lifted sharply forward 
and upward and then brought down with 
vigorous motion followed by a forceful 
push of the toe. 
- 
The sprinter should run on the balls of 
the foot, using a pushing action to get 
drive against the surface of the track. 
- 
Maintain stride length regardless of 
fatigue, run relaxed. 
 
THE FINISH 
- 
When finishing, run through the finish 
line with a straight body; lean in the last 
stride. 
- 
Strengthen opposite muscles to 
prevent injury.

MIDDLE DISTANCE EVENTS  
 
As the distance increases from sprints to middle 
distance events, running form changes; strides are 
shorter, the foot strike is more toward the ball of 
the foot rather than on the toes, arm carriage is 
lower and less vigorous in middle distance 
training, there must be more running. Runners 
should start by building on slow, long distances 
through intervals with short recovery periods.  
Distance runners should run relaxed, 
concentrating on a steady, even-paced rhythm.  
The basic essentials of efficient running involve: 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Foot should be pointed straight ahead.  
The foot strike is more the ball of the 
foot. 
 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms play a balancing role in running 
- 
The arms should be kept at a 90 degree 
angle with thumbs up. 
- 
As the arms move forward and back in 
position, they should never pass higher 
than the chest on the forward move and 
never further than the hips. 
- 
The arms should never cross the middle 
of the body. 
Body alignment  
- 
Once running speed is achieved, the 
body’s angle tends toward the 
perpendicular. 
- 
The body is held almost erect with the 
shoulders and face relaxed. 
- 
There should be little or no rotation in the 
- 
Done 50% pace.  
 
- 
Concentrate on endurance, 
strength, speed and breathing.

upper body. 
 
Stride Length 
- 
The slower the speed of the arm, the 
shorter the stride. 
- 
Longer strides require more energy: in 
distance running where economy of 
energy is important, runners should take 
natural strides. 
 
Breathing 
- 
The runner should keep the jaw relaxed 
and breathe through the nose and mouth 
simultaneously. 
 
Relays in track and field today 
There are two common types of relay in primary 
school track and field.  They are:  
i. 
4 x 100 Meter Relay 
ii. 
4 x 400 Meter Relay 
- 
All relay events consist of four runners. 
- 
All four runners need to understand Baton 
handling, border positions and zone 
awareness. 
 
4 x 100 Meter Relays 
- 
The four runners who make up the relay 
team must stay in their designated lane for 
the entire race. 
Each runner will have to run 100 meters 
before handing off the Baton.

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them with the 
necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an independent, ever-changing world. 
Visual Arts Unit 
Vision 
We envision an art education programme in which all students in The Bahamas are guided toward literacy, an appreciation of Artists, craft persons, and Bahamian 
culture. We also envision an art education programme that is comprehensive and will nurture the spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, creative, imaginative, aesthetic, 
social and physical wellbeing of the child. 
Mission Statement 
Our mission is to advance art education through appropriate curriculum, teacher development programmes, stimulating environments, the provision of materials and 
relevant information. By doing so, we provide students with learning experiences that focus on their creative development, aesthetic appreciation, critical thinking and 
cultural awareness as well as inter-disciplinary integration. 
Belief Statement 
Art education is beneficial to all students regardless of social, ethnic, economic or educational background. Art is an integral part of the overall educational development 
of the student as it compliments and unites other disciplines while promoting visual literacy skills, imaginative thinking and visual communication. 
We further believe that: 
• Art education provides students with the means to think critically, experience, and understand the world around them in unique ways. 
• Art enables students to become self-directed and lifelong learners. 
• Art provides learning opportunities of varying abilities. 
• Art education enhances the ability to interact in society by developing creative problem solving, inquiry, and communication skills, and by providing an avenue 
for self-expression and multiple points of view. 
• Students develop attitudes of appreciation, self-worth, joy in the creation of artworks, and in viewing the works of other students and artists.

• Art is a way to appreciate the beauty and value of the environment and the preservation of our heritage. 
• Art provides opportunities to exhibit in classrooms, schools, art centres and museums, sharing the art curriculum with the community, teachers, students, and 
examiners. 
• Art education increases awareness of career possibilities, promotes entrepreneurial skills and highlights our community’s visual resources. 
• Art education reflects and influences the cultural, social, political and economic aspirations and concerns of our society. 
• Art is a way to appreciate differences and promotes cultural, social and ethnic similarities.

Value 
• Differentiate 
between the 
lightness and 
darkness of colours 
in art and nature. 
• Compare and 
contrast the range of 
hues  
• Produce work with a 
variety of tints and 
shades. 
• Use shading (value) 
to transform a two-
dimensional shape 
into a three-
dimensional form 
(e.g., circle to a 
sphere). 
• Use contrast (light 
and dark) 
expressively in an 
original work of art. 
Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a 
colour can be.  Add white to a colour to 
make it light and add black to a colour 
to make it dark. When black is added 
to a colour it creates a SHADE. When 
white is added to a colour you create a 
TINT. White is the lightest value; black 
is the darkest. Value is important to 
drawing and painting, value changes 
are what creates contrast. Contrast 
helps us understand 2-D artworks.  
• Mix the secondary colours then darken each by 
adding black 
• Make 3 values of each primary colour, light, 
medium and dark 
• Paper collage different colour values together in 
fun shapes and designs 
• Tints and shades with a cherry on top 
• Use stamp pads to create value scales 
• Students examine similarities and differences in 
colour eg. Light blue, dark blue 
• Paint pictures using exclusively light or dark 
colours

motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art through 
repeating lines, shapes, colours, and 
more. Rhythm creates a mood like 
music or dancing. The best example of 
movement in art is Vincent van 
Gogh's The Starry Night, which takes 
your eyes on a rollercoaster ride 
around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears. 
Visual rhythm is created by repeated 
positive shapes separated by negative 
spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your 
eye through the artwork. 
Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements 
in their artwork using the same size 
and length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples 
include flowers, clouds, or waves.

Flowing rhythm is when organic 
shapes are repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, but 
we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes in 
a way that would lead the viewer’s 
eyes from one point to the next in their 
paintings, or use certain brush 
techniques to mimic the movement. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Texture

Texture  
Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough. 
Artists create texture in their artwork

Greek Art 
“Ancient Greeks lived over 3000 years 
ago. Alexander the Great was the 
founder of the Ancient Greek Empire, 
which stretched into Europe, Egypt, 
and South-West Asia. 
The Greeks had some strange 
superstitions about food – some 
wouldn’t eat beans as they thought 
they contained the souls of the dead!  
Did you know that the Ancient Greeks 
invented the theatre? They loved 
watching plays, and most cities had a 
theatre – some big enough to hold 
15,000 people! Only men and 
boys were allowed to be actors, and

they wore masks, which showed the 
audience whether their character was 
happy or sad. Some of the masks had 
two sides, so the actor could turn them 
around to change the mood for each 
scene. 
 Most Ancient Greeks wore a chiton, 
which was a long T-shirt made from 
one large piece of cotton. The poor 
slaves, however, had to make do with 
a loincloth (a small strip of cloth 
wrapped around the waist)!” National 
Geographic Kids 
The Greeks believed in a large family 
of gods who were very much like 
humans; they did not worship animal 
gods. Each god ruled over a different 
part of human life. Zeus was 
recognized as the father of gods and 
humans, Nike was the goddess of 
Victory, Poseidon was God of the Sea, 
Demeter was the Greek goddess of 
agriculture and protected the trees, 
plants and grains. 
Hades was the brother of Zeus and 
Poseidon and the god of the 
Underworld. There were many Greek 
Gods.

“Periods of Greek Art Archaic Period: 
The Greeks from the Archaic Period 
made sculptures of men called Kouroi 
and women called Korai. These statues 
had similar features and stood stiffly 
with their arms at their sides. Classical 
Period: During the Classical Period, 
Greek artists began to sculpt people in 
more relaxed postures and even in 
action scenes. The most famous works 
from this era include the statue of Zeus 
at Olympia and the statue of Athena at 
Parthenos. 
Hellenistic Period: After Alexander the 
Great conquered much of Asia, the 
sculpture and artwork of the Greeks 
became influenced by the cultures and 
people they had conquered. This 
period is called the Hellenistic Period. 
This period saw new subjects 
including women, children, and 
common people appear in Greek art. 
Famous works from this era include 
the Venus de Milo, the Dying Gaul, and 
the Winged Victory of Samothrace.”

Space 
Space is determined by where an 
object is situated; It can be created 
using colour, shapes and values. 
Positive  
This is the object being drawn like an 
apple or a car. 
Negative 
This is the space that is left empty. It is 
the space around and between objects. 
Horizon Line 
The horizon line is the horizontal line 
that separates the earth from the sky 
or the sky from the sea. 
Vanishing Point 
The point where parallel lines meet. 
Background 
The part of the picture that is furthest 
away from you. The objects here are 
very small and the colours are very 
dull. 
Middle Ground 
This is between the Background and 
foreground. 
Foreground 
This is the part of the picture that is 
closest to you or lower down on the 
picture plane. Objects in the 
foreground are largest, brightest and 
full of detail.

Balance 
The way parts of a picture are 
arranged is called balance. 
Artists use balance in their artwork to 
give equal weight to both sides of their 
designs. 
Size. Larger objects have more visual 
weight than smaller objects. 
Colour. Bright colours are visually 
heavier than dull colours. 
Symmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of an 
artwork or an object are identical. 
Asymmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of artwork 
or any object are different or not the 
same. In Asymmetrical balance in art, 
each half is different but has equal 
visual weight. The artwork is still 
balanced even though each side is 
different.

for the “drip” technique he used to 
create his major paintings. Rather 
than using a brush, he poured or 
dripped paint onto canvases. The 
result was abstract paintings. They 
expressed emotions rather than 
presenting a recognizable image. 
Early Life 
Paul Jackson Pollock was born on 
January 28, 1912, in Cody, Wyoming. 
He grew up in Arizona and California. 
In 1928 he enrolled in art high school 
in Los Angeles, California. Pollock met 
a teacher there who trained him in 
drawing and painting and introduced 
him to trends of European modern art. 
In 1930 Pollock moved to New York 
City to study art. It was at this time 
that he dropped Paul as his first name 
and began using Jackson. Pollock 
enrolled at the Art Students League, 
where he studied for over two years. In 
1935 Pollock received a job painting 
through the New Deal, a government 
program created to help end the Great 
Depression. 
Art Career 
Pollock received a contract with a 
famous art gallery in 1943. His first 
one-man show was held that year. His 
painting continued to evolve during 
the next few years. Pollock married

Lee Krasner, also a painter, in 1945. 
He continued to have one-man shows 
of his paintings nearly every year into 
the early 1950s. 
The Drip Technique 
Pollock first used the process of 
pouring or dripping paint onto a flat 
canvas in 1947. These drips and pours 
formed complex patterns that 
expressed his feelings and personality. 
Pollock’s style is also known as action 
painting. 
Death and Legacy 
Pollock died in an automobile accident 
on August 11, 1956. His work had an 
enormous influence on the art world 
during and after his life. Artists that 
came after Pollock looked to him as 
the model of a painter who 
successfully combined art and life.”

Georgia O’Keeffe  
Born in 1887, Georgia O'Keeffe was an 
American artist who painted nature in 
a way that showed how it made her 
feel. She is best known for her 
paintings of flowers and desert 
landscapes. 
She played an important part in the 
development of modern art in 
America, becoming the first female 
painter to gain respect in New York's

art world in the 1920s. Her unique and 
new way of painting nature, 
simplifying its shapes and forms 
meant that she was called a pioneer. 
As well as the shapes of the landscape 
itself, O'Keeffe was fascinated by the 
bones and skulls she found in the 
desert landscapes near where she 
lived.  
Georgia knew from the age of 12 that 
she wanted to be an artist. She went to 
art school but what she was taught 
there didn’t seem relevant to the way 
she wanted to paint. Georgia met other 
artists who, like her, were experimenting 
with abstract art. Art in the 1920s was 
exciting. Artists didn’t just want to 
show how something looked but were 
using colours, shapes and brush-
marks in unexpected ways to express 
meanings, ideas and feelings. This 
encouraged Georgia to develop her 
unique style – a combination of 
abstract and realistic.” Tate Kids
