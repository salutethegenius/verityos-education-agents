The Lucayans were very good
sailors and fishermen. They lived
in huts and slept in hammocks.
They were a peaceful people who
lived off the land in harmony
with nature. Bahamians have
adapted some aspects of their
way of life. People all over the
world now use hammocks.

The Eleutheran Adventurers,
after they landed in The
Bahamas, named the island
they landed on, Eleuthera,
and settled there. Life on the
island was not easy so the
group began to trade wood for
supplies, as farming was not
an option.

The Loyalists were a group of
men who wanted to continue
to be loyal to the king of
England.
 Therefore, they left, the now
independent America and
travelled to The Bahamas that
was still a British colony at
that time.
The Loyalists established cotton
plantations on the family
islands. These plantations
comprised of a house, large
fields and slaves.Large amounts
of cotton were exported to
America and in the off seasons,
slaves were made to rake salt
from the pans.

SLAVERY
SLAVERY
From the 16th to 19th centuries Africans were
shipped to the New World as part of the
Atlantic slave trade. Ships departed Europe
for African markets with manufactured
goods, which were traded for purchased or
kidnapped Africans, who were transported
across the Atlantic as slaves.
  The slaves were then sold or
traded for raw materials, which
would be transported back to
Europe to complete the voyage.
Slaves in The Bahamas came via
different routes. 
Some came direct from Africa
 enduring the middle passage. Th
e middle passage was a perilo
us part of the voyage. Some sla
ves also came with the Loyalists 
from America.
Freed slaves from America
came and settled in The
Bahamas, while others
arrived here by accident
after being ship wrecked. 
Slaves brought new ethnic
groups and traditions to The
Bahamas. 
Slaves - People who are denied their personal rights and
freedom.
 Middle Passage - The voyage of enslaved Africans across the
Atlantic Ocean from West Africa to America.
 lave Trade -The business of procuring, transporting and
selling black Africans as slaves from the 16th to 19th
centuries.

      Lines of latitude and
longitude help us to locate
places on a map. The islands
of The Bahamas are located
between latitude 20°N and
latitude 28°N and longitude
72°W and 80°w.
The compass rose shows the
intermediate points between the
cardinal points on a compass. There are
four intermediate points. They are

In the 1950s tourism became a
business. Sir Stafford Sands, the Father
of Tourism, was in charge of the
Development Board. He aimed to
increase visitor arrival and make
tourism a year round business. He
encouraged hotels to install air-
conditioning. Gambling was legalized
and casinos were built in Nassau, New
Providence and in Freeport, Grand
Bahama. 
These rich people travelled to The
Bahamas for winter (winter residents).
Tourists at this time stayed in hotels
with electricity and plumbing.

advertising tax incentives and the
improvement in air transportation in the

Bahamas year round instead of only in the
winter months.

communities conflicts may
arise from time to time. They
range from disputes over land
to noisy parties or stray
dogs.Even neglect by a
government or community of
its people or disputes over
assets or other things can
cause a problem and result in
some form of conflict.
There are always events
occurring. Conflicts between
countries which may affect
only a few countries or many at
one time. Conflicts often arise
as a result of issues and
disagreements over land,
religion, shortage of resources,
power and control.
All police stations have
holding cells for individuals
charged with an
infringement on the rights of
another.

Bahamas outlines the following
rights of a citizen. These rights
are:  Freedom of Speech 
Freedom of Religion. Freedom
political preference.  A right to
protection of property and
privacy.


The history of the people who came to The Bahamas plays an
important part in defining who we are as a people. It is this
heritage that enables us to trace the origin of many of our
names back to slavery or Loyalists times. Certain islands tend
to have particular family names based on how the island was
settled by the people who went there. One can often tell which
island a person is from based on their surname.

For example, the surname "Rolle" is common on the island of
Exuma. This is because a loyalist with the surname Rolle, an
American Loyalist, settled on Exuma in the late 18th century
with his slaves. Many of his descendants still live on Exuma
today, and the surname "Rolle" is a reminder of their Loyalist
heritage.

On Randol Fawkes Labour Day, Bahamians take time to reflect on the
efforts made by thousands of people in the 20th century to help bring
equality and better labour standards to the country. Workers march
through the streets to show worker solidarity and to draw attention to
the current struggles of workers. The day also recognizes the efforts of
men like Randol Fawkes the ‘father’ of the labour movement in The
Bahamas.

They get people together socially and
boosts or improve the economy of the
island. Regattas are sloop races which
take place on many islands of The
Bahamas. Like festivals they bring people

enjoy watching the boat races.
They also provide opportunity
for sailors to learn and perfect
their skills. They provide a
useful sporting activity and
promote the sport of sailing. 
Throughout the islands of The
