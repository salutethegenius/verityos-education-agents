PREFACE 
 
 
Several strategies were employed to assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum.  The process began 
with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions. These countries included Jamaica, the 
United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois), Canada, and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 guides). The 
documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their rationale and 
philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as well as the Scope of 
Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa and several other countries 
were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of English and the Ministry of 
Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.  
 
Opportunities were also provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers throughout The 
Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted to be included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen (116) teachers 
throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students to get their feedback on what 
they wanted to learn about and the types of learning activities they enjoyed.  Additionally, a focus group was conducted with 
members of the community that included business owners, parents, and those who interact with students in after-school clubs 
and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary teachers, one preschool teacher, and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment Section.  
Opportunities were also provided for several Family Island teachers to submit content and activities through the Education 
Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time engaged in 
research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction to meet the needs of their students.

MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
 
 
VISION 
 
Our vision is for a Bahamian education system that will foster academic excellence and equip students with multiple literacies, 
enabling them to make meaningful contributions as nation builders who are globally competitive. 
 
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of the Department and Ministry of Education is to provide all persons in The Bahamas an opportunity to receive a 
quality education that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and skills required for life, both in a 
democratic society guided by Christian values and in an interdependent and changing world.

BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student-centered; 
2. At each grade level, students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason, and make decisions as well as develop self-confidence 
and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme and 
should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms, which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing sixth 
grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our students 
receive at the primary level lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that students can 
take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on communication skills.  During this period in our history, knowledge of basic communication skills is 
essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and more people are being 
pushed to use online services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct banking transactions, to pay bills, 
to make travel arrangements, to access government services, and so much more.   Additionally, changes in technology 
demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Landlines, that only required listening and speaking 
skills  to use, have been replaced with smartphones and computers that allow us to communicate via WhatsApp, update our 
statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read the information on the internet, buy tickets, post to social media create blogs, 
conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the world, and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new 
ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be confidence that our education system will prepare students 
to communicate effectively despite the changes that occur.  Recognizing that Language Arts skills are the foundation of all 
learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on producing students who are not 
only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability to communicate effectively in a rapidly 
advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves creatively, collaborate, and problem solve as 
we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education 
for all…”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of Oracy, Reading, and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their 
hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that they will need to become lifelong learners and to navigate successfully 
in an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM 
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, teachers 
should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area subjects 
and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual field trips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centres, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level to provide teachers and parents with a guide for what 
students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This information should be 
used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also indicates the level 
of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become proficient in a particular area, 
teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted to make 
them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the end of the course of 
study.  Teachers should be guided by the content, which indicates what students should know or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading (Phonemic 
Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar, and Written 
Composition). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds on the 
previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided into three 
categories:  basic, intermediate, and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can access content 
and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to meet the needs of their students.   
 


 
25 
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of opportunities 
should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with various audiences.  
They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large group settings.  ZOOM, 
TEAMS, and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative projects to be organized with 
students in other schools, districts, islands, and other countries once the necessary safety protocols have been put in 
place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with students.  
Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  To avoid duplication in the 
curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best applied.  It is expected that 
once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the strands and that they can be 
assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This particularly refers to 
reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be highlighted.  Students are to be 
exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are taught through teacher read-alouds and 
independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade level. 
 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales, and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics, and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels, and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading, and after reading. 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening 
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in reading still have opportunities to 


 
26 
 
understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (using pictures, video clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio 
clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions as students connect skills to their everyday 
experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing if 
students have mastered the skill is to have them incorporate it into a writing exercise.  This will allow them to apply what 
they have learned.  Students who can apply reading skills would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  
Following this method of teaching comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated 
into the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling, and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as ends 
in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting; 
however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in the case of 
Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should only be scored for 
what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week, the number of items on the checklist 
should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the checklist should be continually 
reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been generated.  Students should be aware 
of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to assess their writing before it is even 
submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, mechanics, and handwriting/presentation. 
Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three lines until their fine motor skills are more developed 
and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of grade two, cursive handwriting can be introduced if 
students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, and 
words from the grade-level word list included in the appendices of this document.

Resources 
A good listener is someone who 
engages in active listening. Good 
listeners strive to understand the 
total meaning of a communicated 
message.  
 
During informal settings, a good 
listener:   
 maintains an eye contact 
 shows empathy 
 repeats key information when

Standard English is a term applied to 
a language that is grammatically 
correct with no dialect. It 
encompasses grammar, vocabulary, 
pronunciation, and spelling. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can 
interfere with good communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class 
or with a more formal audience.   
Other occasions could be when 
conducting a class assembly, 
participating in a Christmas play etc. 
 
The Bahamian dialect can be used 
when speaking in more informal 
settings, like with family or friends.  It 
has its special vocabulary as well as a 
specific way of pronouncing words. 
It includes words like: 
 
callin’= calling 
bey = boy 
tink = think  
dis = this 
 
In addition to being used in informal 
conversations, Bahamian dialect is 
often featured in plays, Bahamian 
novels as well as radio and 
television commercials. 
Basic:  Call the names of various 
people.  Have students discuss 
whether it would be appropriate to 
use dialect or Standard English if 
they had to speak to them.  
 
Examples: The Prime Minister, 
first cousin, a cashier, a tourist, 
packing boy, the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge etc. 
 
Intermediate:  Students will 
pretend that their favourite 
television star will be visiting their 
school.  Have them develop 
appropriate questions in Standard 
English that will be asked.  
 
Advanced:  Have students listen

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
When speaking, consideration must be 
given to the audience, occasion, and 
location. Sometimes, adjustments have 
to be made to our regular speech. 
 
Volume refers to the loudness or 
softness of the speaker’s voice. Be 
aware of the environment and adjust 
the volume of speech accordingly. 
 
Examples: 
Danger – very loud 
Social/party – loud 
In Class – medium loud/soft/silent 
(depending on the activity) 
 
Rate means how fast or how slowly the 
person is speaking.  The rate can vary 
depending on the occasion. 
 
When speaking ordinarily, speak at a 
pace where people can comfortably 
understand what is being said.  If the 
person speaks too quickly, key 
information may be missed.  If the 
person speaks too slowly, the listeners 
might lose interest.  When speaking for 
dramatic purposes, the pace of 
speaking can sometimes fluctuate with 
the mood of the piece. 
Basic:  Read sentences void of 
intonations. Have students 
determine whether the sentences 
are statements or questions.  
Discuss the importance of 
intonations. 
 
Intermediate:  Have selected 
students read short paragraphs that 
would involve the use of 
expressions.  Encourage the class 
to watch students to determine how 
the paragraph that was read, made 
them feel.  Discuss what the 
readers did to portray those 
emotions.

Pronunciation – This refers to the 
correctness of sound in a word.  When 
speaking formally, ensure that sounds 
like the following are said correctly: 
 Words beginning with th. 
 Endings of words with ing and s. 
 
Use tongue, teeth, and lips to produce 
the correct sounds.   
 
Facial expressions and gestures are 
a form of non-verbal communication 
that help to convey the emotions of the 
speaker.  
Example:  If happy news is being 
delivered, the speaker might wear a

Facial expressions and gestures can 
help to keep the listeners engaged.  
However, they should not be overused 
as they can also distract. 
 
Pitch refers to how high or how low the 
person is speaking.  Some people 
normally may have high-pitched voices 
while others may have low-pitched 
voices.  When completing dramatic 
activities, the speaker may vary the 
pitch depending on who is speaking. 
 
Example: baby- high squeaky voice 
 
Intonation refers to the rising and 
falling of the voice.  The voice may rise 
or fall if a question is being asked or 
demand is being made.  The intonation 
may vary depending on the purpose of 
the statement.  A person speaking in a 
monotone does not have the rhythmic 
rise and fall of the voice.  There is only 
one tone being used. 
 
Pause – Sometimes speakers pause 
to conclude a point, for emphasis, to 
get the audience’s attention, and to 
allow the audience time to think about 
what has transpired.

A syllable is a unit of pronunciation. It is 
a word or part of a word with a single 
vowel sound. The number of syllables in 
a word is determined by the number of 
vowel sounds. Words can be divided 
into syllables.   
  
Syllabication helps in:   
a. Decoding words  
b. Reading fluently   
c. Spelling words accurately   
d. Dividing words at the end of a line 
    when writing   
 
Example: The word “turtle” would be 
divided into “tur-tle” and not “tu-
rtle” or “turt-le”.

cards. In groups, they will cut the 
words into syllables, mix up the 
syllables and then try to put the 
words back together again. They 
will then try to match each of the 
syllabication rules to the word that 
follows the rule. Example: care/ful 
 
Technology Adaptation:   
Teachers can write words on the 
Whiteboard video conferencing

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A consonant blend is two or more  
consonants sounded together so that 
each sound is heard.  
  
Some words begin with consonant 
blends. 
 
Examples:  black, train, spring.   
  
There are four main basic forms of 
initial, medial, and/or final 
consonant blends: r-blends, s-blends, 
 l-blends, and n-blends.   
  
Sample Words:  
crutches     please     quest 
brother       clamp      held 
sweeping   extra        skunk 
skate          crispy      sand 
  
Some blends contain three 
consonants.  Common three consonant 
blends include: str, spl, shr, thr, scr, 
and spr.  
  
Sample Words: 
str words:  stream, struck, stride  
spl words: splash, split, splatter  
shr words:  shrimp, shrug, shrink  
Basic:  Display pictures that depict 
words with initial, middle, or final 
consonant blend sounds. Allow 
students to say the word and 
identify the position of the  
consonant blend.  
  
Technology Adaptation: Using 
an online platform such as 
Teachermade, Quizizz, 
Liveworksheet, etc., to formatively 
assess students’ knowledge of the 
skills taught on initial, medial and 
final blends to decode unfamiliar 
words displayed.  (Students will 
select the correct blend that they 
hear in each word sounded out.) 
  
Intermediate: Create cards  
that have unfamiliar words that 
contain blends in the beginning, 
medial, and final positions in 
columns directly underneath 
a matching die number (1-6).

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The /l/ sound at the end of a word can  
be spelt in several different ways.  
  
Generally, “al” is used when adding a  
suffix on to a base word.     
 
Example: logic - logical  
  
Sample Words  
identical         critical  
hospital          official  
personal         magical  
natural  
  
Use “le” if the sound is part of the word.  A 
consonant normally forms a part of this 
end syllable.  The “le” ending is seen 
mainly after the following letters: b, c, d, 
f, g, k, p, sl, st, t and z.  The le ending is 
never used after these letters: m, n, r, v, 
and w.  
  
Sample Words: 
ble – Bible, cable, grumble  
cle – circle, icicle, muscle  
dle – handle, middle, needle   
fle – raffle, trifle, waffle 
gle – giggle, triangle, single  
kle – buckle, tackle, trickle,

The letter combinations “dge” and 
“ge” make the /j/ sound.  The letter 
combination “dge” is 
a trigraph because the three letters 
always function together to form the 
same sound as the letter “j”.  Use 
“dge” with words that have a short 
vowel sound before the /j/ sound.  
Examples:  
“judge” and “edge”   
  
Use “ge” with words that do not 
have a short vowel sound before 
the /j/ sound.  
Examples: 
“change” and “huge”

Diphthongs are types of vowels 
where two vowel sounds are 
connected in a continuous, gliding 
motion (to make one sound). They are 
often referred to as gliding vowels.  
   
Examples of diphthongs are: /oi/, 
/oy/, /ow/, /ou/.  
  
The diphthongs ‘ou’ and ‘ow’ can have 
two distinct sounds.   
 
 /ou/ can sound like ‘ou’ as in 
‘house’, and like ‘ou’ as in ‘soup’.  
 /ow/ can sound like ‘ow’ as in 
clown and ‘ow’ as in glow.

Resources 
An abbreviation is a shortened form 
of a word that ends with a period.   
  
In abbreviations, you will notice 
that:   
  
1. Most are spelt with the first  
    letters of the word(s).  
    Example:  company – co. 
 
2. Some are spelt with a  
    combination of letters from the  
    word.   
    Example: government – govt. 
  
3. Others are spelt with letters not  
    found in the original word.  
    Example:  ounce – oz. 
  
4. Many abbreviations begin with a  
    capital letter.  
    Example:  Florida – Fl. 
 
5. Some abbreviations that include  
    unit of measurements or capital  
    letters do not need a period.  
    Example:  meter - m 
  
 
Basic: Have students play  
an abbreviation game on a 
gamification platform as teams or 
individually.  Ensure that 
students are given feedback 
on correct and incorrect answers 
for reinforcement.  
   
Intermediate: Have students use 
a dictionary to find provided words 
and then abbreviate them. Allow 
students to document their 
findings on a sheet of 
paper. (Example: mph- miles per 
hour)  
   
Advanced: Have students 
document words in their 
environment that have been 
abbreviated.  Ask them to share 
their list with the class names on 
the guest list with abbreviated 
titles and initials for first and 
middle names. Tell them that 
addresses with abbreviations are 
to be written for each name.  
  
Have students complete

have to identify the 
abbreviated form of 
familiar words across

Objective 2.29: Identify the base word, prefix or suffix in words and the meanings associated with them. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Words often contain base words.  A 
base word is the part of a word that 
can stand alone and has meaning.  It 
is the simplest form of a word.  
  
Example: “Cycle” is a base word that 
means “wheel”.  
   
Prefixes and suffixes can be added to 
base words to change the meanings 
of these words.  
  
Prefix – A prefix is a word or syllable 
that is added at the beginning of a 
base word.    
  
Prefixes have their special meanings 
too.  
  
Examples:  
The prefix “bi” means “two”.  
The prefix “tri” means “three”.  
  
The word “bicycle” means a “cycle 
having two wheels”.  
  
A “tricycle” means a “cycle having 
three wheels”.  
Adding “bi” and “tri” to the word 
Basic:  Make three sets of word 
cards – one containing root words, 
one containing prefixes and one 
containing suffixes. Divide the class 
into teams, then, mix the root word 
cards with either the prefixes or 
suffixes.  Distribute an equal 
number of cards to each team and 
designate one team member to 
record words. Use a three-minute 
timer as students race to form as 
many words as possible from their 
cards. The recorder writes the 
words as they are formed so that 
they can be read aloud at the end 
of the game. Give one point for 
each correctly formed word. The 
team with the most points wins.   
   
Intermediate:  Using the same 
basic activity, mix both sets of 
affixes with the word cards.  
Students must use both in the 
creation of their words.  
 
Advanced: Have students use the 
meaning of the prefix or suffix to 
figure out the meaning of words.  
 
Have students 
complete a worksheet 
where they have to 
add prefixes and 
suffixes to base words 
and write their new 
meanings.

A suffix is a letter or group of letters 
added after a base word to alter its 
meaning and form a new word.  
 
Example:  
“Care” is a base word meaning to be 
“concerned with or interested in”.  
  
“Ful” is a suffix meaning “full of” or

Objective 2.30: Add inflectional endings (with or without) spelling changes. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
An inflectional ending is a word part 
that is added to a base word.  This 
ending can make a word plural, 
change word tense, or help to make 
comparisons.  Inflectional endings are:  
s, es, ing, ed, er and est.  
 
1. Adding “er” and “est”  
If a word ends in a “consonant” 
and “y”, change the “y” to “i” and 
add “er” or “est”.  
 
Example:  happy – happier 
 
If the word ends in a “consonant” and 
“e” remove the “e” and add “er” or 
“est”. 
 
Example:  late - latest 
 
Sample Words:  
 
happier  
fancier  
silliest  
simpler  
bravest 
finest 
 
 
2. Adding “ed” and “ing”  
If the base word ends in a consonant 
vowel consonant and a stressed 
syllable, double the final consonant 
Basic: Have students draw two 
columns. The heading of the first 
column should be Base Word. 
The second column should be 
whichever inflectional ending is 
being taught (-s, -ed, -ing). Give 
students the base word to write in 
the first column and have them 
rewrite the words correctly with 
the inflectional ending in the 
second column.  
   
Intermediate:  Give students a 
cube. Write only the numbers one 
two and three on the cube. Have 
them take turns in groups of four 
or five rolling the cube. If they roll 
number one they must supply a 
word that has one letter added to 
it (e.g. schools). If they roll a two 
they must say a word that has two 
letters added to it (wished), etc.  
   
Advanced:  
Have students place inflections 
correctly on word endings to make 
sentences correct according to the 
tense, mood, voice, number, 
gender, etc. A worksheet will be

Resources 
The two main spellings of words that we 
use in The Bahamas are a mixture of 
British English and American English. It 
is important to distinguish between the 
two because of the spelling and 
pronunciation differences.  
  
British English was influenced by 
words adopted from languages like 
French and German. 
 
American English focuses on how the 
word sounds when spoken. 
  
Some spelling differences can be found 
at the end of words or the spelling 
changes completely.   
 
For Example:   
British   
American  
-ce 
-se 
-re 
-er 
-our 
-or 
-t 
-ed 
-que 
-k 
-se 
-ze 
-l 
-ll 
-ogue 
-og 
Basic:  Have students review a 
list of words and identify whether 
the British or American spelling is 
used. 
  
Intermediate: Present students 
with various scenarios and ask 
students to write the spelling of 
the word that would be 
appropriate given the context. 
 
Examples:   
 You are completing an exam 
at the University of Miami. 
 
 You are writing a shopping list 
for a friend from Great Britain.

spelling test where they have to 
provide both the British and 
American spelling.

certain roots can assist with 
spelling and understanding what 
particular words mean.  It can also 
help to see connections between 
words.  
  
Spanish  
Spanish words entered the English 
vocabulary through several 
means:   
 
a. With the arrival of Columbus in 
The Bahamas came the 
establishment of trade with people 
from Spain.  Through this 
interaction, the Spanish introduced 
new words

to identify foods because 
there were no English words for 
those items.

the reader should reflect the mood 
of the piece.   
Examples  
Sad- Read slowly, lower the voice  
Angry – Loud, booming voice  
Happy – light voice  
Afraid – stuttering voice  
  
Pitch of Voice - Refers to the 
loudness or softness of the voice.  
Basic:  To assist with controlling the 
loudness and softness of the voice, 
have students say the alphabet from 
“A to L” in this manner.  
  
A-C – soft  
D-F – medium loud  
G-I – Loud  
J-l – Very Loud  
  
Then have students do the reverse. 
Ask students to read various texts in 
varying degrees of loudness and 
softness.    
 
Intermediate:  Have students listen to 
a recording of an audio story.  Stop at 
different points.  Discuss how the 
character is feeling. Have students 
provide information to support their 
inferences.  Highlight the techniques 
that the actor used to relay those 
emotions.  
  
Advanced:  Have students use the 
techniques discussed above in a 
reading of their own.  
 
 
Have students read a 
selection.  Use a 
rubric to assess 
students’ pacing, 
intonation, and 
expression.

Resources 
Text structure refers to how an author 
organizes information in a text. Being 
aware of non-fiction text structures and 
their purpose helps readers to navigate 
the text that they are reading.  There 
are five basic structures that authors 
use. 
 
 Description - Provides a variety of 
information about a particular topic.   
 
Examples:  brochures, menus.   
Keywords/phrases - for example, 
the characteristics of etc. 
 
 Sequence - Provides the order in 
which something happened or 
should happen.   
 
Examples: recipes, calendars         
Key Words - first, next, finally 
 
 Problem/Solution - Identifies a 
need and shows ways in which it 
can be addressed.  
 
Basic: Students can create a 
text structure anchor chart with a 
section for each type.  There 
should be a definition and 
examples. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
complete a text structure sort, 
where they are given cards to 
read and determine to which text 
structure the text on the card is 
referring. 
 
Advanced: Give students two to 
three pieces of text.  Have them 
identify what type of text 
structure the selections are. 
Students must justify their 
choices. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Give students different 
samples of non-fictional 
texts.  Have them identify 
the text structure used in 
each and give reasons for 
their choices.

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A well-written story has five (5) core 
elements. Being able to identify 
these elements and knowing how 
they work together in a story helps a 
reader to better understand the 
author’s work. The elements of a 
story include:  
  
Character: The people or animals 
and objects behaving like humans in 
the story are known as the 
characters. Paying attention to the 
words, thoughts, and actions of a 
character gives the reader clues 
about a character’s feelings and 
nature.  
  
To figure out the nature of a 
character, ask yourself these guiding 
questions:  
 What thoughts is the character 
having?  
 What is the character saying?  
 How is the character acting?  
 What type of attitude do these 
types of thoughts, actions, and 
words suggest?    
 
 
Basic: Movie Trailers Provide each 
student with a list of common 
universal themes. Play a movie 
trailer and have students predict 
what the movie might be about (the 
conflict and possible solutions). 
Challenge students to then predict 
the theme of the movie and provide 
evidence from the trailer to justify 
their choice.  
  
Use different trailers to repeat that 
same method for teaching the 
setting and characters. Provide 
additional guided practice with short 
stories.

Point of View: is about ‘who’ is 
telling the story. The speaker is 
known as the narrator. Narrators 
can be a character in the story or a 
witness who is not a character but is 
speaking about what happened. 
Pronouns used by the narrator give 
clues to help the reader figure out 
‘who’ is telling the story.

time can be in the past, present, or 
future. The place can be real or 
fantasy. If the author does not 
identify the setting, a good reader 
looks for details to figure it out.  The 
setting can include the weather, time 
of day, and seasons. However, not 
every setting is important to the 
story.   
  
To determine if the setting is 
important, a reader can ask:   
 Would the story change if the 
events were happening in a 
different time and place?   
 Would the characters behave and 
feel differently in a different time 
and place?  
Plot: The plot refers to the order of 
the most important events in a story. 
A story plot is made up of a 
beginning (introducing the setting 
and characters), a conflict in the 
middle, and an end (telling how the 
problem is solved). The conflict of a 
story is something that goes wrong 
for the main character. The main 
character can face a conflict with 
himself, another character, culture, 
or nature.

Context Clues refer to words that 
surround an unfamiliar word in a 
passage that give clues about the 
meaning of the new word.  Some 
context clues are: 
  
Synonyms – Words that mean the 
same or almost the same as an 
unfamiliar word.  
 
Example: 
The petrified or scared boy walked 
slowly to the principal’s office. 
 
Antonyms – Sometimes a context clue 
would contrast with a new word.  
 
Example:  Ashley was kind to the new 
boy, not vicious. 
  
Definition – This is the kind of context 
clue where the writer gives the meaning 
of or explains a word in a sentence.  
 
Example:  Mackerel, a small fish, is 
eaten with grits as part of a Bahamian 
breakfast. 
Basic:  Using an overhead

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The main idea of a text is the 
most important idea that the 
writer wants you to know about 
the topic. It is what is mostly 
being talked about in the text. 
Knowing the main idea helps a 
reader to better understand and 
organize the lesser details of the 
text when summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and retelling.   
 
Sometimes, a writer directly 
states the main idea in the text. It 
can be stated at the beginning of 
a paragraph as the topic 
sentence or the end as the 
concluding sentence.  
 
Sometimes, the main idea is 
unstated, and the reader must 
figure it out from the supporting 
details. The supporting details 
are the sentences that tell us 
more information about the main 
idea.  They answer questions 
such as who, where, when, what, 
and how.   
 
 
Basic: Have students explore several 
newspapers to discover how picture 
captions and headlines are examples of 
main idea phrases. Present students with 
a variety of pictures with a lot of details 
(action, people, etc). Lead students to 
read the pictures using The Visual 
Thinking Strategy: 
 
1. Details: What is going on in this 
picture?  
2. Evidence: What do you see that 
makes you say that?  
3. Prediction: What do you then think will 
happen next?

newspaper headline for their picture and 
one sentence telling the main idea of the 
picture. Allow learners to share their work

Resources 
The stories we read can be divided 
into two major categories or 
genres: fiction and non-fiction. 
 
Knowing whether a story is fictional 
or realistic can help the reader to 
better understand the ideas of the 
author and make reasonable 
predictions. Good readers slow 
down when reading nonfiction to 
think about what is being 
communicated. 
 
Fiction: A story that is fiction is not 
true.  These are stories made up by 
the author. Examples of fictional 
stories include: fantasy, fairy tales, 
legends, science fiction, folklore, 
and realistic fiction. 
 
Realistic Fiction – stories that can 
happen in real life but didn’t happen 
 
Fairy Tale - stories about magical 
creatures with happy endings, 
usually written for children 
 
Fable – These are stories where 
animals, plants, or objects are

1. Details: What is going on in this 
picture?  
2. Evidence: What do you see that

3. Prediction: What do you then 
think this film will be about?  
 
Use the posters and students’ 
predictions to discuss the 
differences between the various 
genres. Assign each student a 
poster to create a themed invitation 
for the movie premiere event. 
Encourage students to include the 
specific traits of the sub-genre and

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
In a world filled with free-flowing 
information, “fake news”, and 
persuasive techniques, it is 
important that a person can tell the 
difference between a fact and an 
opinion.  
 
A fact is a statement that can be 
proven true or false.  This may be 
done through further reading, 
observation, or by asking an expert. 
 
Example: The Princess Margaret 
Hospital is located on Shirley Street. 
  
This can be proven by looking at a 
map or by visiting Shirley Street. 
  
An opinion is a statement that tells 
what someone is thinking or how the 
person feels about a particular thing.  
Opinions can change.  Opinions 
cannot be proven because they are 
based on someone's personal 
thoughts, feelings, and 
understanding.  Words that often 
provide clues that an opinion is 
being expressed are: think, feel, 
believe, best, worst, etc.  
Basic: Divide a worksheet designed to 
test the difference between facts and 
opinions into individual statements. Place 
them in a bag and have each student 
choose a statement. Assign two labelled 
spots in the classroom: one for facts and 
one for opinions. Allow students to 
classify their statements by moving 
under the correct label. Have students 
take turns reading their sentences aloud 
and defending their choice. Provide 
corrective feedback. Challenge learners 
to convert all the factual statements into 
opinions.  
  
Intermediate: Provide learners with a 
persuasive passage. Use The Think 
Aloud Strategy to demonstrate how to 
determine which statements are factual 
and which are opinionated. Provide 
guided practice with other short 
passages. Divide students into pairs and 
give them a passage to identify the 
factual statements with a highlighter and 
underline the opinions with a pencil. 
Check the accuracy of responses and 
give feedback.  
 
 
Spot the Error: Fill in 
the answers on a 
worksheet asking 
students to decide 
whether a statement is 
factual or opinionated. 
Intentionally include 
inaccurate answers.  
 
Provide students with 
the incorrect 
worksheet. Ask 
learners to spot and 
correct all the errors. 
Require students to 
provide a rationale for 
each correction made.

When we compare, we look to see 
how two or more things are alike.  
Keywords such as “same”, “both”, 
“like” and “as” are clues that 
signal when things are being 
compared.  
   
When we contrast, we look to see 
how two or more things are 
different.  Keywords such as 
“different”, “however”, and “but” 
are clues that signal when things 
are being contrasted.   
  
The graphic organizer that is 
commonly used to compare and 
contrast is called a Venn 
Diagram. The Venn Diagram is 
simply a diagram that shows the 
overlapping of two circles.  The 
outer areas of each circle are used 
to indicate the individual 
characteristics of the item or thing 
being compared.  The inner part, 
where the circles overlap, is where 
the characteristics that they share 
in common are written.

Objective 2.48: Make inferences. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The author does not always directly 
tell the reader everything that is 
happening in the story.  However, the 
writer gives hints or clues so that the 
reader can figure out what is not 
stated directly.  Good readers use the 
information given, along with what 
they already know, to make 
inferences.   
  
There are several different types of 
inferences that can be made.  
 
1. Location – Authors may give 
clues as to where a particular thing 
or event is taking place or where 
someone might be headed.  To 
figure out clues related to location, 
when reading, ask the following 
questions:  What is in the 
environment?  How are the 
characters reacting to the 
environment?   
 
Example:   Derek gathered 
his towel and his goggles.  He 
smiled as he got the black inner 
tube from the garage so that they 
 
Basic:  Have students create a riddle 
about their favourite place to visit.  
Have them share the riddle with a 
friend.  Make the connection that 
solving a riddle is a lot like making 
inferences. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students read 
several scenarios.  They should use 
the information given to make 
inferences. This can be done as a 
whole class activity or in pairs.    
  
Example: Tim got his suitcase, 
passport, and ticket.   
  
Where is Tim most likely headed?  
What clue words helped you to infer 
the correct answer?  
 
Advanced:  As a class, read aloud 
passages where students have to 
make inferences about location, 
occupation, and time.  Discuss 
answers to inference-related 
questions.  Then have students do 
this activity in small groups and pairs 
before letting students work 
independently. 
Have students 
answer oral and 
written questions 
related to the three 
types of inferences 
studied.

could take it to the gas station to 
be blown up.  Where is Derek 
going? Using the clues and your 
own experiences, you should infer 
that he is going to the beach.   
 
2. Occupation – Writers can provide 
clues as to the type of work/job a 
person does.  To figure out clues 
related to occupation, when 
reading, ask the following 
questions:  What is the person 
wearing?  What is the person 
doing?  What types of materials 
or items are mentioned?    
 
Example:  Mr. Capron, dressed in 
his red t-shirt and brown pants, 
removed the nozzle from the gas 
tank, replaced the cover on the 
tank and collected a crisp $20.00 
bill. What is Mr. Capron’s job?  He 
is a pump attendant.   
 
3. Time – Instead of giving the exact 
time, day or month it is, authors 
give clues to help you infer the 
time.  To figure out clues related to 
time, when reading, ask the 
following questions:  What are the 
characters doing?  What is in

or scents are mentioned? 
   
Example:  Everyone arrived at the

The room was beautifully dressed 
in hearts.  The scent of 
chocolate, coming from the 
hundreds of little tiny chocolate 
kisses that could be found 
everywhere, hung in the air. Which 
month of the year is it most likely?  
February. 
 
Quite often, inferences made, have to 
be defended.  These questions can 
come in many different forms, but they 
are all asking the reader to provide the 
clues from the passage that helped 
them to make their inferences. 
 
Examples 
 How do you know? 
 Give evidence to support your 
answer. 
 Support your answer using 
information from the passage? 
 Why do you think this is the 
case?

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A cause is an action or idea that makes 
something happen.  An effect is what 
happens because of this action or idea.  
   
A cause can have more than one effect as 
well as an effect can have more than one 
cause.  To find the cause-and-effect 
relationship during reading, a good reader 
asks:  
 
 What happened? (Effect)  
 Why did this happen? (Cause)   
 
Sometimes, an author or speaker may use 
a signal word to show the cause-effect 
relationship. Key/Signal Words: because, 
since, when, as a result, therefore, and so  
  
Example:   
“As a result of the tour bus being late, the 
tourist missed the cruise ship.”  
 
In this sentence the cause is, “The tour 
bus was late.”   
 
The effect is, “The tourist missed the 
cruise ship.”  
 
When keywords are not used, it is up to the 
reader to make the connection.  
 
Basic:  Let students gather in a 
circle.  Using a soft rubber ball, 
give a cause. Then, throw the ball 
to a student who gives an effect.  
That student then gives a new 
cause and throws the ball to 
another student for an effect.  As 
an alternative, the teacher can 
give an effect and have the 
student give a cause.  That cause 
becomes the new effect, and 
another student then gives a 
cause to that effect.

students an index card with a 
cause or an effect on it and have 
them find their partners to match 
the causes with the effects.

Every author has a reason for writing.  This 
is known as the author’s purpose. 
There are four common reasons for 
writing:  
 
1. To inform - This type of writing 
gives information about a concept to 
teach the reader something 
new. Examples:  a textbook or a “How

2. To entertain - This type of writing tells a 
story about real or imaginary characters, 
places, and events to evoke 
feelings such as joy, sadness, or 
suspense in readers. Examples:   a 
play, story, or lyrics to a song 
 
3. To describe - This type of writing allows 
the writer to use the senses to show a 
person, place, thing, or event through 
his/her eyes. It allows the writer to share 
feelings and emotions as 
well. Examples: a travel blog or a 
brochure about Disney World

and that is why readers should do it as 
well so that they are not left out. 
Example: “All of the cool kids are 
wearing Air Jordans to school.” 
 
 Testimonials – Celebrities, social 
media personalities, public figures, and 
movie stars may be used to endorse a

 Regardless of the author’s purpose, there 
are clue words in his or her writing that tell 
us how the author feels or his/her viewpoint 
about what has been written. To find out 
how the author feels about a piece of 
writing, ask the following questions. 
 
1. Are there “feeling” words included in the 
piece, such as  good, bad, great, 
fantastic, terrible etc.? 
2. How is the event, person, thing, or idea 
being described? irresponsible, 
organized, interesting, boring etc. 
3. Are negative or positive words being 
used in the piece?  distasteful, tasty, 
satisfying, dissatisfied, filling etc. 
4. Does the author appear to be arguing 
for one side over another? 
 
Examples: 
 
Informative Piece – The potcake breed of 
dogs is a mixture of breeds that are 
commonly found in the Caribbean.  These 
dogs are very loving, loyal, and street 
smart.  They can easily be house-trained.  
They make awesome pets!

author feels? The word “awesome” is 
used to indicate that potcakes would 
make good pets, so we can assume that 
the author likes potcakes. 
 
Descriptive Piece- The school’s play was 
excellent!  It was well-written and action-
packed.  The audience was entertained 
from start to finish as they laughed at the 
antics of Steven, who was the main 
character.  Steven was always getting into 
trouble but always managed to escape 
punishment. 
 
 Does the author use descriptive words 
to describe the play?  The author 
describes the play as being “excellent”, 
“well-written”, and “action-packed”.  He 
indicates that it was very entertaining 
and had the audience laughing. This 
means that he thought it went well.

Persuasive Piece- Dumping trash on the 
roadside is one of the most disgusting 
things that a human being can do.  We are 
a tourist destination.  No one wants to go 
on vacation to view trash.  Garbage also 
attracts rats and roaches, which can

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Good readers use details and what is 
already known to draw conclusions. 
A conclusion is a logical decision that 
the reader reaches after identifying 
clues in the text as well as prior 
knowledge. This conclusion should 
make sense using the information 
provided.   
 
Example:  The puppy’s tummy began 
to rumble.  His last meal was yesterday 
morning.  He sniffed fresh bread baking 
and moved in that direction.  Just then, 
Mrs. Rolle opened her back door and 
placed a tray of golden-brown loaves of 
bread on the back porch to cool and 
went inside. The puppy edged closer. 
 
The inference here is that the puppy is 
hungry.  The clues are: “His tummy is 
rumbling” and “He has not eaten since 
yesterday morning”.  
 
Based on this information, the 
conclusion that can be drawn is that the 
puppy will eat the bread that has 
been placed on the porch to cool.  
We can conclude this because he has 
not eaten in a while, and he is edging 
Basic:  Have students view the 
first few strips of a newspaper 
cartoon.  Have them use what 
they see to draw a logical 
conclusion about what will happen 
next.

Have students create scenarios 
and use pantomime to share them 
with their classmates. Peers

Science.  
 
Advanced: Have students read 
the lines from popular songs, 
poems, or interviews about our 
national heroes, such as the 
Golden Girls, Sir Milo Butler etc.  
Ask them to draw conclusions 
about these individuals.  Have

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Making judgements is more than 
just forming an opinion about 
characters, events, and ideas in a 
story or article that may have no 
consequence.  Judgements are 
decisions that are made based 
on evidence found in a passage, 
what the readers knows, and the 
reader’s own experiences, 
beliefs, morals, and values.    
    
When reading fiction, readers 
make judgements by agreeing or 
disagreeing with a character’s 
actions.  They may also decide if 
a character or an action is fair or 
unfair, wise, or foolish or generous 
or selfish.  
   
When reading nonfiction, readers 
make judgements by agreeing or 
disagreeing with what the author 
wrote.    
   
Judgements should always be 
supported by evidence from the 
passage.  
  
 
Basic: Students can read various 
messages (SMS or WhatsApp) and 
make judgements about the sender.  
Students should support their 
judgements using the text, gifs, emojis, 
and images that were sent in the 
message.    
  
Intermediate: Thumbs up or 
down!  The teacher and student 
volunteers will read short passages.  
Students will put their thumbs up or 
down to show if they agree or disagree 
with the character’s actions (fiction) or 
the author’s viewpoint (nonfiction).  Have 
various students discuss their 
judgements and the details from the 
passage that supports the judgement 
made.  
  
Advanced: Have students read a

to discuss the paragraph using 
questions such as:  
 
 Do you agree with the author?  Why 
or why not?  
 Did the author offer good advice?

A proverb is a common saying or 
phrase that is used to give advice or 
explain what is believed to be true 
based on experience.  
Some common ones are:  
 
“Every shut eye ain’t sleep.” One 
must be careful because some 
people who seem not to be paying 
attention are paying attention.    
 
“Fisherman never calls his own 
fish stink.”  Some people will never 
acknowledge or admit to their 
shortcomings, faults, flaws or 
mistakes.   
 
“Leopard can’t change its spots.”  
People cannot change their basic 
personalities or habits.  
 
“All good things must come to an 
end.”  Everything ends; good times 
don’t last forever.  
 
“Beggars can’t be choosers.” If 
you’re in a bad situation and 
someone offers to help you, you have 
to take whatever they give you and 
shouldn’t ask for more.

Good readers recognize when an 
author is using figurative language. 
Figurative language refers to “a 
phrase or group of words that mean 
something different altogether from 
what is being said or written”. To 
decide if a phrase has a figurative 
meaning, ask: “Could this really 
happen, or does this make 
sense?” 
  
Alliterations and Onomatopoeias 
are types of figures of speech that 
act as the sound effects of the text. 
Focusing on a particular sound or 
description helps the readers to see 
a clearer picture of what is being 
described. 
  
Alliterations are created by 
repeating the beginning sound in 
two or more neighbouring words. 
  
Example: The wicked witch wildly 
whooshed away. 
  
Onomatopoeia refers to words that 
are actual sounds.  
Basic: Tongue Twisters in 
Context Have students read aloud 
Dr. Suess’ “Oh, Say Can You Say?. 
Lead from their emotional responses 
to the tongue twisters to discuss the 
effects of alliteration and 
onomatopoeia on readers.

onomatopoeia in context.

When trying to interpret an 
alliteration and onomatopoeia, a 
reader can ask: 
  
1. What person, place, thing, or 
idea is being described? 
2. What is the sound effect telling 
me about this person, place, 
thing, or idea?   
3. What does the author want me to 
think or feel about the thing 
being described? 
Similes and Metaphors make 
comparisons of two unlike things. 
  
Similes are phrases that begin with 
like or as.  
  
Example: The COVID-19 pandemic 
hit us like a rushing tsunami.  
  
However, metaphors are phrases 
that do not use the words like or as.

Handwriting can tell a lot about a person.  Is 
this person neat, organized, and careful?  
This means that it is important to pay careful 
attention to our handwriting.  
  
Ensure that the letters are of the appropriate 
size and height.  Leave sufficient space 
between words.  
  
When writing sentences on lined paper, 
ensure that the margins are observed.  There 
is a left red margin and a right red margin.  
  
Unless you are writing a paragraph, begin 
the line of writing at the left margin and end it 
at the right margin.  Use syllabication rules 
to break up a word that may be too long to 
include without going over the right margin.  
  
When writing a paragraph, indent the first line.  
This means that space about the size of a 
“thumb” is left between the left margin and the 
start of your sentence.  The second line in the 
paragraph should begin right at the left 
margin. Letters of invitations and special 
messages can be written using cursive or a 
decorative form of writing called calligraphy. They 
can also be designed using a computer.  
Basic:  Have students create 
their handwriting checklist that 
they can use to evaluate their 
handwriting.  Have them use it 
as they copy sentences from 
the board into their notebooks.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
copy verses from Proverbs that 
teach life lessons 
or motivational quotes into their 
books.  Have them assess 
their handwriting.  
  
Advanced:  Have students 
copy the school’s prayer.  
 
Have students write a 
paragraph.  Use a 
rubric to assess their 
writing.

The computer can be a useful tool when 
creating and printing reports, letters, 
invitations etc. Choosing a font that is easy to 
read, and is a reasonable size is very 
important. Font sizes between 12 and 14 are 
acceptable sizes to use in documents such as 
reports.   
  
Font styles that can be used when creating 
reports or letters are:  
 
Arial 
 
Times New Roman  
 
Calibri  
  
Letters, reports, and assignments should 
always be typed using a black font colour.  
  
More creativity can be used when designing 
invitations, flyers, posters etc.  Font sizes can 
be bigger, and letters can be bolder and more 
colourful to emphasize important information.  
The fonts used can be more of a fun style.

Over 3,000 years ago, the Ancient 
Romans invented symbols to write 
numbers that included letters from the 
Latin alphabet.  
  
I represents 1  
V represents 5  
X represents 10  
L represents 50 
C represents 100 
D represents 500 
M represents 1,000  
  
To represent some numerals, a 
combination of symbols is used.  
  
Example:    8 = VIII  
  
Roman numerals can be written using 
capital letters or small letters.

Objective 3.17: Distinguish between sentences and fragments. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A sentence is a group of words 
that express a complete 
thought.  It has two main parts:  
a subject and a predicate.   
 
A fragment is an incomplete 
sentence. It can be written like 
a sentence with a capital letter 
at the beginning and end 
punctuation, but it doesn’t 
express a complete thought.  It 
is usually missing a subject or a 
verb. 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Prepare sentences and fragments on 
strips of paper to play Sentence Dunk: Have two 
baskets labelled “Sentence” and “Fragment”.  
Have students take turns reading the group of 
words on the strips aloud.  Have them decide if it 
is a sentence or a phrase.  If they are correct, 
have them crumple the paper to make a “phrase” 
or “sentence” ball.  Ask them to throw it into the 
correct basket for a score. 
 
Intermediate:  Place sentences and fragments 
on a card that is in the shape of a car.  Tell 
students that they are now mechanics who must 
figure out if any repairs need to be done to each 
vehicle.  They must correct the fragments by 
writing the corrected sentence on a sheet of 
paper.  If it is already a complete sentence, they 
will record it under a column labelled “Already 
Tuned”. 
 
Advanced:  Have students go on a fragment 
scavenger hunt around the classroom.  Place 
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet where 
they have to 
identify sentences 
and fragments.

A run-on sentence is two or more 
sentences that are incorrectly joined 
by a comma or by nothing at all. 
 
Example of a Run-On Sentence 
and Ways to Correct It: 
 
“John left his bag at the store his 
sister just brought it home.” 
 
Without any punctuation, this run-on 
sentence is difficult to follow, even 
though it is short. Easy corrections 
include: 
 
1. John left his bag at the store. His 
sister just brought it home. 
 
2. John left his bag at the store, and 
his sister just brought it home. 
 
3. John left his bag at the store; his 
sister just brought it home. 
 
4. Because John left his bag at the 
store, his sister brought it home. 
Basic:  Write run-on sentences on 
sentence strips. Have students work in 
pairs – one reads the sentence aloud, 
stopping where he/she thinks the first 
sentence should end; the other reads 
the remaining portion of the sentence 
strip. Have them write the two 
sentences. They should ensure that 
they put in the necessary conjunction or 
capitalization and punctuation marks. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students play the 
game “Cluster Buster” where they must 
eliminate the cluster in run-on 
sentences.  They must choose a card 
from a bag that contains run-on 
sentences.  They will then have 20 
seconds to “bust” the clustered 
sentence, thus correcting the run-on 
error.

Objective 3.20: Identify different types of nouns. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Nouns are words that name a person, 
place, animal, thing, or idea. 
These are known as common nouns 
because they do not name a particular 
person, place, animal, thing, or idea.  
 
Common nouns are usually not 
capitalized unless they begin a sentence 
or are part of a title. 
 
Examples:   
 Person:   police 
 Place:      downtown 
 Animal:   dog          
 Thing:     building 
 Idea:       fear 
 
A proper noun is the name of a particular 
person, place, or thing.  A proper noun 
begins with a capital letter. Days of the 
week, months of the year, and holidays 
are proper nouns. 
 
Examples:   
 
Charles Smith 
Bamboo Shack 
Wednesday 
 
Andros 
East Street 
Samsung 
Doctor’s Hospital 
 
Basic:  Play “Noun Dunk”.  Have 
two baskets labelled “Common 
Noun” and “Proper Noun”. Have 
students throw word balls into the 
correct basket for a score. 
 
Intermediate:  Call out a common 
noun, such as “country”. Have 
students name as many proper 
nouns in that category as possible 
e.g. “The Bahamas”, “Jamaica”, 
“Haiti”. This can be played as a 
game, in teams, and maybe written 
or oral. If a student calls out a 
common noun, instead of a proper 
noun, other students/teams may 
challenge it for extra points. 
 
Advanced:  Present students with a 
grade four supply list of common 
and proper nouns. All items are 
typed in lower case (pencil, ruler, 
oxford primary dictionary, elmer’s 
glue, bahamas primary mathematics 
book 4, etc.). Have students re-write 
this list differentiating between the 
common and proper nouns.  Have 
the use of capital letters where 
necessary. 
Have students 
identify common and 
proper nouns in a 
passage.

plurals of most nouns that end in 
vowels, or in any consonants except 
‘ss’, ‘x’, ‘ch’, ‘sh’ or ‘y’.  
 
Add ‘es’ to the end of the word to 
form plurals of nouns that end in ‘ss’, 
‘o’ ‘x’, ‘ch’ or ‘sh’. 
 
For nouns that end in a consonant 
and ‘y’, form plurals by changing the 
‘y’ to ‘i’ then adding ‘es’ to the end of 
the word.

Some nouns have irregular plural 
forms.  They are not formed by adding 
‘s’ or ‘es’. Instead, the spelling of the 
noun must change. 
 
To form the plural of nouns ending with 
‘f’ or ‘fe’, drop the ‘f’ or ‘fe’ and add –
‘ves’. 
 
Examples:   
       shelf- shelves  
       knife – knives 
 
Some exceptions are roofs and 
proofs. 
 
Some words change their vowels. In 
some words ‘oo’ is changed to ‘ee’. 
 
Examples:   
       tooth – teeth  
       goose – geese 
 
In some words ‘an’ is changed to 
‘en’. 
 
Examples:   
woman – women 
 
Basic: Sing the song “Ten Green 
Bottles Sitting on the Wall’. 
Substitute ten green bottles with ten 
irregular plural nouns in the song. 
 
Examples:   
“Ten little children, sitting on the

accidentally fall, then there would 
be nine little children sitting on the 
wall. Nine little mice sitting on the 
wall. If one little mouse should

A compound word is made up of 
two smaller words.   
   
The two words that make up the 
compound word often indicate the 
meaning of the compound word.  
  
bath + room = bathroom – a room 
for bathing.   
  
foot + ball = football - a sport that 
involves kicking a ball.  
  
Some compound words are written

Objective 3.26: Form singular and plural possessive nouns. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The possessive form of a noun is 
used to show ownership. Only 
nouns can be possessive. 
 
A singular possessive noun is 
used to show ownership by one 
person or thing.  The possessive of 
a singular noun is formed by adding 
an apostrophe (’) and the letter ‘s’ at 
the end of the word.  
 
Example: the officer’s whistle 
 
A plural possessive noun is used 
to show ownership by more than 
one person or thing. There are two 
rules for forming a plural possessive 
noun. 
 
1. If the plural noun ends with the 
letter ‘s’, add an apostrophe (’) 
after the ‘s’. 
 
2. If the plural noun does not end 
with the letter ‘s’, add an 
apostrophe (’) and the letter ‘s’ 
at the end of the word.  
 
 
Basic:  Write five sentences on the 
whiteboard. Provide each student 
with sentence strips. Have them 
write the singular possessive noun 
to complete each sentence.  
 
Examples:  
 David lives in Exuma. _______ 
home is in Barrataree.  
 
 David lives in Exuma. David’s 
home is in Barrataree. 
 
Intermediate:  Use picture cards (or 
word cards) to practice using the 
possessive form of common nouns. 
Show a picture of a dog and a bone 
and have students describe the 
bone as “The dog’s bone”, either 
orally or in writing.  Cards may have 
the singular (word or picture) on one 
side, and the plural on the other. A 
picture of two or more dogs or the 
word card “dogs” should elicit the 
response “The dogs’ bones”.

A verb is a word that tells what the 
subject of a sentence does, did or 
will do. A verb can also express the 
state of being.  
  
Action verbs express action.  
Example: My classmates created a 
puzzle.  
  
Linking verbs do not express 
action. Instead, they connect (or 
link) the subject of the verb to 
additional information about the 
subject.  
 
Example: We became computer 
geniuses last year.  
  
Some examples of linking verbs 
are:  am, is, are, was, were, feel, 
look, seem, grow, and appear.   
   
Example: Virtual classes are 
exciting.   
 
Helping verbs come before main 
verbs and provide more details 
about the time of an action. Helping

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A verb changes its form depending on 
if the action is happening, has 
happened, or will happen. Telling the 
time an action occurs is known as the 
verb tense.  
 
There are three main tenses: past, 
present, and future. 
  
The present tense of a verb shows 
what is happening now.  
Examples: They work. She studies. 
  
The past tense of a verb shows 
actions that have already happened.    
Regular past tense verbs end in –ed.  
Examples: They worked. She 
studied. 
  
The future tense of a verb shows an 
action that will happen.  It is usually 
formed with the helping verbs “will” or 
“shall”. Examples: They will work.  
She shall study.  
  
Sometimes, authors revise their 
writing by changing the verbs to a 
different tense.  
Basic: Have students identify the 
verbs in sentences.  Ask them to 
read the verbs to a partner and 
state whether it is the past, 
present, or future tense.    
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
work in small groups to 
choose from a book a paragraph 
that describes a historic event in 
the past tense. Using large chart

The simple subject is 
the main word or words in a 
sentence that tells who or what the 
entire sentence is about.  
 
The simple subject is often just one 
noun or pronoun and is found within 
the complete subject of a sentence.

be joined by using ‘or’ or ‘and.’   
  
Examples:  
Carla opened and read the book.  
   
Terell usually swims or plays 
soccer on Saturdays. 
 
Authors use compound sentences 
to prevent the writing from 
becoming too dull and repetitive to 
the reader.  
Basic: Have students play a game 
called “Flip the Compound”. Place a 
sentence on each flashcard. Flip 
each card over and challenge 
students to identify the compound 
subject or compound predicate. 
The student with the 
most cards wins!  (Digital 
flashcards can be created on 
https://classmaster.io/). 
 
Intermediate: Provide students 
with pairs of simple sentences. 
Have students combine sentences 
to make a compound subject or 
compound predicate. 
 
Example: Ebony loves to sing. 
Ebony loves to dance, too. 
Combined: Ebony loves to sing 
and dance. 
 
Note: Encourage students to pay 
attention to any changes needed 
for the subject and verb to agree.

Objective 3.35: Use adjectives to describe nouns and pronouns. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
An adjective is a word that describes or 
modifies a noun or a pronoun. Adjectives 
can tell what kind, how many or which 
one. Adjectives can be used to add 
descriptive details when writing.  
 
Adjectives can compare two things that 
may be the same or different in some way.  
If they are different, we compare them by 
adding “er” to the end of the adjective.   
 
Example:  
This bed is harder than that one. This 
road is safer than the other.    
 
When comparing more than two things, 
some adjectives take on the “est” ending.  
 
Example: 
He is the tallest boy in the school.     
 
Some adjectives compare by adding the 
words more (comparing two things) and 
most (comparing three or more things).  
 
Examples: 
Basketball is a more physical sport than 
fishing.   
Winter is the most wonderful season of all.  
Basic: Ask students to stand.  
Display an object or a picture of 
an object. Give the first student 
a ball.  Have the student 
provide an adjective to describe 
the object and then pass the 
ball to the next player.  The 
next player then calls out 
another adjective. If the student 
cannot produce an adjective 
quickly, then he or she is out 
and must sit.  Once three 
players cannot provide an 
adjective, it is opened to the 
class for their answers, and 
then a new object is introduced.  
The last student standing wins. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
make a list of proper adjectives 
used to describe different types 
of food.  
Examples:  Andros Crab, 
Eleuthera pineapples, 
American Cheese, French fries 
etc.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
An adverb is a word that gives more 
information about a verb, an 
adjective, or another adverb. It tells 
“how”, “when”, “where”, or “to what 
degree”.  
 
Adverbs that tell how an action took 
place, often end in “ly”.  
 
Examples:  quickly, slowly, lazily, 
nicely, and loudly.  
 
Some adverbs describe when 
something happens. This can also 
include how often and how long.  
 
When – yesterday, now  
How often – weekly, always  
How long – forever, shortly  
 
Adverbs can also tell where.  
 
Examples:  inside, outside, around, 
through, below  
 
Adverbs can also indicate to what 
degree or to what extent. When 
comparing two things, use “er”. For  
more than two use “est”.  
Basic: Have students play Adverb 
Scattergories, a game in which 
players are given a category 
(where, when, how often, how long) 
and must call out adverbs in that 
category.  
 
Intermediate: Play the card game, 
"Spoons" using adverbs. Have 
groups of students brainstorm ten 
activities they saw, read or heard 
about recently. Then have them 
write sentences using adverbs to 
describe various actions, such as 
The goatskin drummers proudly 
led the parade. Have a member of 
each group share their sentences. 
Then have the class decide 
whether the adverbs tell “how”, 
“when” or “where”.

A preposition is a word placed before 
a noun to show its relationship to some 
other word in the sentence.   
Prepositions can tell location, direction, 
time, and relationships. 
Examples of commonly used 
prepositions are: about, above, across, 
after, against, among, around, at, 
before, behind, beside, between, by, 
down, during, except, for, from, in, near, 
of, off, on, over, through, to, toward,

duty of a preposition in a sentence.  
They must be followed by an object to 
be considered a preposition.

Coordinating Conjunctions join 
words, phrases, and sentences.  
Some coordinating conjunctions 
are: and, but, for, so, yet and or.  
 
Coordinating conjunctions are used in 
several ways: 
 
Joining words 
Jan and Jean will get the groceries 
from the shop around the corner. 
 
Joining phrases

fence and through the yard. 
 
Joining Sentences 
John loves to fish, yet he will never 
get on a boat. 
 
When a conjunction separates two 
sentences, a comma should be placed 
after the first sentence and before the 
conjunction as shown above.   
 
When coordinating conjunctions join 
two sentences into one, the sentence 
is called a compound sentence. 
Basic: Organize students into 
groups, and provide each group 
with conjunction cards. Using 
PowerPoint or the whiteboard 
display a sentence that has a line 
where the conjunction should be. 
Instruct students to hold up the 
conjunction card that will make the 
most sense in the blank space.  
Discuss responses and 
alternatives.

There are four main types of writing. 
They each serve a different purpose. 
 
1. Narrative Writing – This type of 
writing tells a story.  It is mainly 
written for entertainment. A personal 
narrative tells a story about the 
writer. 
 
2. Descriptive Writing – This type of 
writing may describe a person, 
place, thing, or event.  The senses 
as well as figurative language such 
as similes and metaphors are used 
to give details about what is being 
described so that a clear picture is 
painted in the reader’s mind.  
 
3. Expository Writing – This type of 
writing provides information and 
gives an explanation or directions. 
 
4. Persuasive/Opinion Writing - This 
type of writing expresses how the 
writer thinks or feels about a 
particular subject. 
 
Basic:  Provide students with 
everyday types of writing that 
represent the four types.  Have 
them work in groups to classify 
them.  Ask them to share with the 
class and give their reasons for 
placing them in their groups.

Sequence is the order in which things 
happen or should happen.  Sequential 
order is very important when one is 
relaying a story, writing directions, or 
providing instructions for performing a 
particular task, or describing 
something. 
 
Before Words: ‘Prior to’, ‘last time’ 
and ‘until that time’ 
 
Words that Show First: ‘Starting 
with’, ‘in advance’ and ‘firstly’ 
 
Words that Show Next: ‘Secondly’, 
‘thirdly’, ‘soon after’, ‘in time’ and ‘right 
after’ 
 
Words that Show Last: ‘Finally’ and 
‘to conclude’  
 
Another way to put ideas in order is to 
use space order, particularly when 
describing the location of something. 
Space order tells about something 
from top to bottom or from left to 
right or vice versa.  Prepositions like 
‘above’ and ‘beyond’, relay specific 
images. 
Basic: Print pictures of a 
sequenced science-related event. 
Examples: the metamorphosis of 
tadpoles to frogs, flowers to seeds, 
etc. Mount the pictures on cards. 
For each set of pictures, have the 
students use transitional words to 
describe the order in which the 
metamorphosis takes place. 
 
Intermediate: Have students list 
ALL of the steps involved in putting 
on a shirt (this list should be very 
comprehensive) Present the shirt to

choose two students to come to the 
front. Have one student provide 
his/her list of instructions one by 
one and have the other student 
carry out each step EXACTLY as 
directed. Unclear or omitted 
instructions will result in the

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A paragraph is a group of sentences 
about the same idea. The main idea of 
a paragraph is what the paragraph is 
about.  The main idea is often relayed 
in the topic sentence which is usually 
the first sentence in a paragraph that 
gives information and is indented.  
Knowing the purpose of the essay will 
help in forming the topic sentence. 
 
Other sentences tell more about the 
main idea and are called supporting 
details.  If you want to describe the 
way something looks or feels, your 
supporting details should be vivid 
descriptions.  If your purpose is to 
inform your reader, your supporting 
details should be facts. If your purpose 
is to persuade, then you should have 
solid reasons to support your 
viewpoint.   
 
The last sentence in a paragraph 
should tie the supporting sentences 
together. It is called the concluding 
sentence.  A strong conclusion sums 
up the main idea of a paragraph in a 
vivid way.   
Basic: Have students choose a 
favourite television show. Have 
them write one statement that 
encompasses how they feel about 
that show. Then have them list 
details that support their opinion 
and order these details based on 
their significance.  Have them use 
this list to write their ideas in 
paragraph form. 
  
Intermediate:  Present students 
with an interesting question like, 
“What is your favourite holiday?”

How a piece of writing is started is 
very important because it is at the 
beginning when many readers decide 
whether to continue reading or to 
stop.  The type of writing and the topic 
should be considered when writing an 
introduction.  Ensure that a topic 
sentence is provided.  
 
There are several different ways to 
begin a piece.  Writers should select 
the best one for the particular type of 
writing that they are doing.

“announce” that it is “the end”.   
There are several ways to conclude a 
piece of writing.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Voice refers to how much of the writer 
can be felt in a piece.  Is the writer 
interested and passionate about what 
is being written?    
  
The work of many famous authors 
can be recognized by their voice and 
writing style.   
  
The writer’s voice comes through in 
the tone and mood of the 
piece.  Tone refers to the feeling that 
an author creates.  Is the piece 
serious? playful? angry? etc.   
  
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the piece.  Is 
the reader happy? sad? fearful?  It is 
important that the tone matches the 
message that the writer is trying to 
send.  If the subject is serious, for 
example, the language should not be 
light or funny.  
 
 
 
 
 
Basic: Write voice descriptors 
on individual slips of paper, 
fold them, and put them into a 
bag. Ask students to draw a 
type of voice out of the bag 
and act it out until a classmate 
guesses it.  
Example:  sarcastic, happy, 
angry etc. 
  
Intermediate: Have students 
read excerpts from different 
pieces and discuss the voice 
that is portrayed.  Discuss 
reasons for their responses.   
  
Advanced: Give students a 
particular topic on which to 
write.  Assign them different 
voices from which to write.  
Example:  confident, shy, 
sarcastic etc. 
 
Have students write a piece 
that portrays a particular 
mood.

story only from your perspective.  
  
Second Person – When writing from 
the perspective of someone who is 
watching what is happening, use 
pronouns like you and yours.  
  
Third Person – From this viewpoint, 
you are the person who is looking 
on.  Use pronouns like he, she, it, 
and they.   From this perspective, 
you get to experience the thoughts of 
the characters.  
  
Personification - This is when the 
writing is done from the perspective 
of an animal or object.  This is 
accomplished by giving the animal or 
object human characteristics such as 
speaking or gesturing.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Writers often use dialogue in their 
narrative pieces to make them more 
interesting.  Quotation marks are used 
to set apart the exact words of the 
speaker from the rest of the 
sentence.  One of the quotation marks 
appears at the beginning of what was 
said and the other at the end.  The first 
word in a quote is capitalized. 
  
Example: 
“What is your name?” I quietly asked.  
  
Commas are mainly used to separate 
who is speaking from what is being 
said.   
   
Example: 
“Mark,” I shouted, “Come and get your 
bag.”  
We walked slowly to the gate, “Should 
we open it?” I asked.  
  
Quotation marks are also used to identify 
the title of a song or a piece of writing.  
 
Example: 
 “March on Bahamaland” is the name of 
our national anthem. 
Basic:  Present an image from a 
sitcom.  Have students write what 
the characters might be saying using 
the appropriate quotation marks.

A descriptive essay is a group of 
paragraphs that can describe a 
particular person, place, or event.  
The details are presented in such a 
way that it makes it easy for the 
reader to visualize what the writer is 
describing.    
 
A descriptive essay should have a 
captivating introduction that provides 
the reader with an overview of what is 
being described.  The body of the 
essay should provide specific details 
about what is being described.  The 
writer should end with a concluding 
thought about the thing, place or 
person that was described.    
 
There are several strategies that 
authors use when writing 
descriptively.  The words that are 
used to describe, should be carefully 
selected so that they convey detailed 
images to the readers. 
 
 
 
 
Basic: Have students watch 
YouTube videos on Similes, 
Metaphors, Hyperboles, and 
Onomatopoeia. Project an 
example of a literary device and 
have student groups compete to 
identify the literary device. They 
can explain their answer for 
bonus points. Groups can 
compose their examples of each 
literary device. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
read an excellent descriptive 
paragraph on an appropriate 
topic (The Lucayans, Crabbing 
in Andros, Junkanoo etc.). Have 
students discuss what makes 
the paragraph so “descriptively 
rich”. Have students utilize some 
of these techniques in a 
paragraph of their own. 
 
Have students write a 
descriptive essay on a 
self-selected topic.

 Show Me, Don’t Tell Me is a 
strategy that authors use to 
provide interesting and descriptive 
details.  For example, instead of 
saying that a person is angry, the 
author shows that a person is 
angry. 
 
Example: 
“Her smile faded and was replaced 
by a straight line.  Her eyes 
narrowed, and her cheeks began 
to turn red.  She snarled, “Get out 
of my way now!”  She pushed 
Trevor aside and went marching to 
the principal’s office. 
 
 Words that focus on the senses 
are used:  what we can smell, 
taste, see, touch, and hear. 
 
Example:   
“When I arrived home, the scent of 
frying chicken hung in the air.  As 
I made my way into the kitchen,  I

 Literary Devices are also used as 
a tool for making writing 
interesting.  There are several of 
them that can be used. 
 
o Similes are phrases that begin 
with “like” or “as” and are used 
to compare two unlike things. 
Example: “Her dress was as 
colourful as a “rainbow.” 
 
o Metaphors are also used to 
compare. They do not use “like” 
or “as”. Example: “Stacy is all

Spelling.” 
 
o Alliterations are created by 
repeating the beginning sound 
in two or more neighbouring 
words. Example:  Benson

words that are actual sounds.

Friendly letters are written to our 
family and friends. The purpose of a 
friendly letter is to share a message 
with persons with whom we are 
familiar.   Friendly letters should 
include the following: 
 
 The heading - This includes the 
address of the sender and the 
date. It is normally written in the 
right-hand corner at the top of the 
page.  
  
 Salutation or Greeting - This is 
the way to identify to whom the 
letter is being written.  It usually 
begins with “Dear.”  A comma 
follows the name of the person. 
  
 The body of the letter – This is 
considered the main part of the 
letter.  Include all of the interesting 
details about family and friends 
and write about what you have 
been doing, your hobbies etc.  You 
should indent the first sentence in 
each paragraph.

Resources 
An opinion expresses a thought or  
feeling about a particular thing. 
Persuasive writing is a type of opinion 
writing, as it provides the author’s views 
on a particular topic. The essay should 
have an introduction, a body, and a 
conclusion. 
 
Introductory Paragraph: Begin the 
persuasive essay with an introductory 
statement that captures the attention of 
the readers.  Begin with a startling 
statement or question. 
 
Examples:   
 Did you know that many of the 
inmates in jail are reading far below 
grade level? 
 
 This weekend alone, Nassau has 
experienced more than 12 inches of 
rain. Even during category 1, 2, or 3 
hurricanes, we have not 
experienced this amount of rainfall.  
Do you still think that climate 
change is not real? 
Basic: Have students act out 
what they would say to their 
parents in a conversation to 
convince them they deserve a 
new cell phone, a raise in their 
allowance, or a new sibling! 
Students can play as the child and 
the parent.  Discuss the 
effectiveness of the conversations 
and the reasons provided.  Using 
the projector, as a group, 
compose a persuasive paragraph 
together.  
  
Intermediate: Place students in 
groups.  Provide a worksheet with 
links to a few commercials for 
different products. After viewing 
each advertisement, have 
students identify the 
persuasive technique utilized, cite 
the example, and finally, rate its 
strength to convince. Have 
students choose an item to 
compose a commercial using one 
of the techniques identified. 
 
 
Have students write 
a persuasive piece 
using persuasive 
techniques.

The introductory paragraph should also 
have a topic sentence that indicates the 
writer’s opinion on the topic and 
mention the supporting reasons that will 
be discussed in the paragraphs that 
follow. 
 
The Body of the Essay: This is where 
the writer develops the reasons to 
support their opinions.  Each paragraph 
in the body should represent one of 
those reasons with supporting 
evidence.    
 
Writers normally present their reasons 
in order of importance.  They begin with 
the most important reason to support 
their opinion and then present the 
others in descending order.  Several 
persuasive techniques can be used to 
develop the body of the persuasive 
essay. 
 
Using Facts: Using information that is 
true to strengthen your reasons.  
 
Example:  
“Millions of tourists visit The Bahamas 
every year. That is why I believe it is 
the destination of choice in the 
Caribbean...” 
Advanced: Have a representative 
from the Humane Society or a 
veterinarian speak to students 
about the benefits of having a dog 
as a pet.  Also, allow them to 
share how animals can be 
mistreated.  Have the students 
discuss reasons why every child 
should or should not have a pet.  
Have each student take a side to 
develop into an expository essay.  
They may wish to begin to 
organize these reasons by using a 
T chart. Have students use this 
chart to individually compose a 
persuasive essay. Have students 
use facts, superlatives, and 
generalizations as their 
persuasive techniques.

Generalizations: Using phrases to 
describe something that is accepted by 
all. 
 
Example:  ‘all of my friends, ‘the entire 
team’, ‘nobody in grade four’ etc. 
 
Superlatives: Using terms to describe 
the highest quality of something.

best’ etc. 
 
Data:  Using numbers, percentages, 
fractions, quantities etc. to make 
reasons appear more believable. 
 
Example:   
“It is important that during this phase of 
the pandemic, we do not organize 
indoor parties.  At least six of the new 
Covid cases were linked to a party held 
out West a week and a half ago.” 
 
Conclusion: 
In the conclusion, writers can take this 
opportunity to reinforce their opinion 
again and include words to spur the 
readers into action.

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL  
ORAL PRESENTATION RUBRIC 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the oral presentation skills of students in grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors 
are so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: content and delivery. This gives the flexibility of use as teachers and students can decide if to focus on one aspect of 
an oral presentation or both sections.

USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEACHING OF READING 
 
 
THE READING PROCESS  
 
The reading process aims to provide readers with a systematic framework to monitor and guide their thinking, understanding, 
and response to a text. The overarching goal is for learners to eventually apply this process with automaticity inside and outside 
the classroom environment. However, to achieve this goal, readers must have multiple opportunities to observe this process 
being effectively applied to various texts and be allowed to use this method with guided support.  
 
The following Guide Steps for The Reading Process can be placed on individual bookmarks or posted on a classroom chart 
for ease of reference by students. 
 
BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
 Scan the Text. Ask yourself: 
o Is this text fiction or non-fiction?  
o Scan the cover, title, chapter 
headings, and pictures of a 
fictional text. 
o Scan the headings, bold print, 
and illustrations of a non-fictional 
text. 
o Skim read a few of the words. 
 
 
Think about what you know already 
about this topic.*  
 
 
Make predictions about what the 
 Read the text in chunks.  
 
 Stop and check if you understood 
what was read. Ask yourself: 
o What has happened so far? What 
important information was given 
already? 
o How am I feeling about what I am 
reading? 
o Do I need to re-read any 
confusing parts? 
o Can I see a clear picture in my 
mind of what is being shared? 
o Are the illustrations helping me to 
 Summarize and reflect on the main 
ideas of what you read. Ask yourself: 
o Did I learn any new information or 
ideas? 
o Do I have any burning questions 
left unanswered about this topic? 
 
 Connect it to your real life. Ask 
yourself: 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something else I read? 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something I have experienced 
before?

text may be about.  
 
 
Think about what you may learn, 
feel, or encounter in this text. 
 
understand what I am reading? 
o Were my predictions correct? If 
not, what is my new prediction? 
 
 Figure out only important unknown 
words. Ask yourself: 
 Are there any context clues or 
word parts to help figure out the 
meaning?    
 Evaluate what you read. Ask 
yourself: 
o Did I agree or disagree with these 
ideas? 
o Have I changed my mind or 
feelings about this topic? 
 
 
*NOTE: Pay careful attention to the student’s responses here and determine if the reader has sufficient background 
knowledge about the topic to understand what is about to be read. If it seems that the reader does not, pause here and 
provide learning experiences to build knowledge before reading.  
 
 
BASAL READERS 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-levelled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate 
reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension 
skills, and vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 


 
258 
 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
THE LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE APPROACH 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the 
board or chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the language arts 
components (speaking, listening, writing, and reading) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teachers’ observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read 
orally. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps 
the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 


 
259 
 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading focuses on developing readers’ ability to independently apply both strategies and skills in context. Readers are 
arranged in groups of four to six based on their instructional reading level and provided more targeted reading instruction and 
support. The instructional sessions are focused on the students’ use of multiple strategies or skills in context.  
 
BASIC ROUTINE FOR USING GUIDED-READING INSTRUCTION 
1. 
Conduct a diagnostic assessment of readers. 
5. Provide direct instruction or coaching on a specific 
strategy or skill. 
2. 
Group students according to their reading levels. 
6. Offer meaningful activities to the rest of the class while 
engaged with a group. 
3. 
Select a variety of texts at the instructional level for each 
group. 
7. Conduct ongoing reading-level assessments to track 
progress. 
4. 
Allow students during group sessions to read the entire 
text or sections. 
8. Provide individual or peer-led instruction to students who 
require further instruction. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As a student progresses in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings about the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, 


 
260 
 
science and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, the more demand for 
reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  A lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ abilities and interests, and be ready to help students find the right books at the 
right time.  Learning students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can 
be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage 
students to visit their school libraries. 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least a 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate.

SAMPLE OF READING ENRICHMENT DAY MENU 
 
The Power of Choice! People are naturally more motivated to participate in an activity when given individual choice, and 
learning menus are built on this tendency. They are flexible enough to be used with any content, ability, or grade level. Here is 
a sample of a Reading Learning Menu that can be used on Enrichment Day. Students are to complete all activities from The 
‘Must Do’ category and choose reading activities from The ‘Can Do’ category according to their preference.

DAILY ROUTINE FOR VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION 
 
Vocabulary is the gateway to comprehension, and greater word knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding of a text. While 
this is true, it is impossible to teach the meaning of every word to students. Therefore, vocabulary instruction in the classroom 
should be reserved for words that would have the greatest impact on the comprehension of a text. When learning the meaning 
of an unknown word, the definition is only the first step. Students must have multiple opportunities to engage with the word and 
be able to use it in different forms and contexts. Below is a basic 5–10-minute daily routine for vocabulary instruction for 
unknown words:

Give direct instruction 
on the meaning of the 
word. Provide

examples of the word 
usage in everyday life. 
 
Allow students to use 
pictures, words, or body 
movements to 
represent its meaning, 
description, 
explanation, or 
example. Encourage 
creativity. 
Provide vocabulary 
activities to deepen the 
experience (examples / 
non-examples, 
analogies, related 
words, word parts, 
compare & contrast 
meanings with other 
words, etc.). 
Play vocabulary word 
games with the 
focused words and 
other familiar words. 
Have students present 
their understanding of 
the word and its usage 
to a partner or another 
audience. Encourage 
creativity. 
NEXT STEP: The new vocabulary word can now be added to the classroom word wall or the students’ personalized spelling 
log. Be sure to continuously revise these words in a fun way!

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL: HANDWRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRIC 
OVERALL LEGIBILITY 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the legibility of students’ writing in grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors are so 
detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two sections: 
letter formation and presentation. This gives the flexibility of use, as teachers and students can focus on one aspect of their 
handwriting or both sections during assessments.
