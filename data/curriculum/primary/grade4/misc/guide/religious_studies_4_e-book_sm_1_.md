GRADE 4
God, The Creator
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
     Everything God created is special or
extraordinary. The sun, moon, and stars have
special functions. The planets are uniquely
designed. All the plants and animals are different
and unique. Human beings are God’s most special
creation (Gen. 1:27). 
     Visible and invisible things were created for different reasons. Human beings
were created to take care of everything God created. Visible things like plants
and animals are used for food, clothes, and shelter. Invisible things like atoms
and the air support everything. Invisible things like heaven and angels
encourage us to have faith in God. 
      God created visible and invisible things. Visible things like humans, animals,
and plants can be seen and touched. Invisible things like atoms, gases, and
angels cannot be seen or touched. Visible and invisible things are all important
for the Earth to exist.

God, Our Father
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 73 - 74
     God’s love for mankind is eternal or everlasting
(Psalm 103:17). God loved us from the beginning
of creation and His love will never end. Psalm 63:3
states that God’s constant love is better than life. 
     The Bible tells us that God is our Father (Eph.
4:6; Matt.23:9). He provides all our needs (Phil.
4:19). His steadfast love and mercies never cease
(Lam. 3:22-23). He promised to protect us forever
(Ps. 121:8). From these scriptures we can conclude
that God is a faithful Father. 
     There are many ways in which we can honour
God’s love and faithfulness. Because God is love,
we should show His love to others in our words
and actions (1 John 4:7-8). We should honour
God’s faithfulness by being faithful in praying,
worshipping, reading God’s Word and loving
others.

     Christians use words such as omnipresent,
omniscient and eternal to describe the
nature or attributes of God. Omnipresent
means that God is everywhere. Heaven is His
dwelling place but His presence can be felt
throughout the Earth. Omniscient means that
He is all knowing. Man’s thoughts and inner
secrets are known to God. Eternal means
that He is unending; He has no beginning
and no end.  
The Nature of God
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
     Truths related to the nature of God are found in Scripture. Psalm 90:1-2
reveals that God is eternal or everlasting. Psalm 139:7-8 tells us that God is
omnipresent or everywhere. First John 3:20b tells us that God knows everything
(omniscient). 
     Christians believe that God is a Trinity of Persons. The word trinity means
three. God is one God who exists as three divine persons – The Father, Son and
Holy Spirit. St. Matt. 28:19 speaks about the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 
       We can use natural examples to help us understand the concept of the
Trinity. Objects like an apple or an egg can be used to explain the Trinity. Such
comparisons are helpful but not perfect.

Jesus Christ the Son of God
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. God
referred to Jesus as His beloved Son (Mark 1:11). Jesus existed
from the beginning before He came to Earth (John 1:1-2). He
was born through the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35).
 
     There are many scriptures that explain why Jesus Christ
came to Earth. John 6:38 states that Jesus came to do the will
of his Father. Jesus came to save sinners and give us eternal
life (Luke 19:10; John 3:16). Romans 5:8 states that Jesus came
to die for sinners. 
      Jesus Christ’s coming to Earth was significant because He
was the only one who could bring salvation to mankind (Acts
4:12). He came to Earth to die so that individuals can have
abundant life (John 10:10) and peace with God (Romans 5:1). 
      Individuals should express gratitude to God for sending
His Son to save mankind. This can be done through verbal
praise and thanksgiving. Accepting Jesus Christ as Saviour is
the best way to show gratitude to God for sending His Son.

Miracles and Teachings 
of Jesus Christ 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
While on Earth, Jesus Christ performed miracles for the
following reasons: 
To show that he was divine or from God 
To help people  
To build people’s faith or belief in Him 
To cause people to listen to his teachings. 
Jesus Christ taught that a disciple should:
Take up his cross and follow Him (Luke 14:27) 
To and make disciples (Matt. 28:19) 
Share the Gospel or Good News (Mark 16:15) 
Obey God’s Word (John 8:31) 
Love others (John 13:35) 
A disciple of Jesus Christ should be: 
Obedient willing to learn humble willing to suffer 
loving 
compassionate

The Holy Spirit
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 81 - 82
The Holy Spirit is referred to as 
a Comforter. This means that the 
Holy Spirit assures us of God’s presence and
helps us. He reveals God’s truth to us so that
we can have faith and find direction. He fills
our hearts with joy, peace and hope.
      The Holy Spirit is the Third Person in the Trinity. He is known as the Holy Ghost,
the Spirit of Truth and the Comforter. Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to be with His
disciples (John 14:16).
Before Jesus returned to Heaven, He promised to ask the Father to send the Holy
Spirit to be with the disciples and to live in them (John 14:16-18). Christians are
called temples of the Holy Spirit (I Corinthians 3:16). They must keep their hearts
clean so the Holy Spirit can dwell in them.
There are many scriptures 
where the Holy Spirit is mentioned
with God, the Father and Jesus, the
Son. In John 14:16 Jesus said that He
would ask the Father to send the
Holy Spirit. Matthew 3:16-17 reveals
that the Father, Son and 
Holy Spirit were a part of 
Jesus’ baptism.

The Fruit of the Spirit 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Holy Spirit spreads God’s love, joy and peace in our
hearts. We develop love by being kind and helpful to
others. We become joyful by singing songs, praying and
helping others. The Spirit helps us to understand God’s
Word and this gives us joy and peace. 
Christians are responsible to spread love, joy and peace in
this world. Collaborating with others makes it easier to
accomplish this mission. Ways to spread love, joy and
peace include helping those who are less fortunate,
beautifying the environment and being ambassadors for
peace. 
In Galatians 5:22-33 we read about the Fruit of the Spirit.
The Holy Spirit produces Fruit in Christians as they learn
about Jesus and grow. The Fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness and
self-control.

The Bible, Our Guide  
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Bible is a book that reveals God’s love for the
world. God’s love caused Him to send His only Son into
the world to save us (1 John 4:8-9). God’s love
disciplines us (Prov. 5:11-12). God loves us and calls
us His children (I John 3:1). God’s love endures
forever (Psalm 136:1).  
     The Bible guides our everyday
living by instructing us how to live in
peace and harmony with others, obey
laws and rules, care for the
environment, including animals and
plants, be fair and just, take care of
the poor, respect other people, Live a
simple life.
     Many people around the world live
their lives based on such teachings
from the Bible. Without the Bible our
lives would be disorganized and
meaningless. 
God gave the Israelites the Ten
Commandments which teach
about loving God and others. The
first five teach us about loving
and obeying God and the last
five about loving others (Exodus
20). Jesus said that we must love
God with all our heart, soul and
mind and our neighbours as
ourselves (Matt. 22:37-39).

The Book of Books 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The most commonly used Bible is a collection of 66 books made
up of various genres or types of writings namely: Law, History,
Poetry/Wisdom, Gospels, Epistles/Letters and Prophecy. 
      For example, the Commandments that speak against killing and
stealing are still enforced in society.
      The books of Poetry /Wisdom are read in churches, especially the
Psalms. Many parents use wise sayings from Proverbs to train their
children. Many individuals use wise sayings from Proverbs to help them
in life. The five books of Poetry/ Wisdom contain writings about God,
life and love.
     The 5 books of the Law contain laws and instructions from God to
the children of Israel. They also tell stories about creation and great
men like Abraham. 
     The books of the Law contain rules and instructions that guide our
daily lives. The Ten Commandments form the basis of many of society’s
laws.

Who Am I? 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
     Thinking, speaking and being able to solve problems are very
important skills. Human beings can think of new inventions,
technology and ways to make life easier. They can share ideas
with each other and find ways to solve problems. 
     Both Adam and Eve, as human beings, were created in the
image of God (Genesis 1:27). They were created with special
skills and abilities. They were both valuable to God and to each
other. Galatians 3:28 states that we are all equal in Christ
Jesus. 
     Human beings can celebrate the worth and value of others
by:  
Respecting one another  
Cheering when someone does well  
Being kind to one another 
God created man with the ability to think, speak and solve
problems. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve communicated
with God and each other. Adam named all the animals God
created. When they were cast out of the Garden, they had to
find ways to provide for their daily needs.

Our Gifts and Talents  
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Individuals were given gifts and talents for many reasons
namely: To worship God, To help others, To help take care
of the Earth, To help us achieve our goals.
There are many ways in which children can use their talents
to help others in need. They include: 
Organizing a talent show to raise funds for the needy,
Visiting a home for the elderly and sharing their talents, 
Helping someone clean his/her yard, 
Making cards to share with people who are sick or in a
 home, 
Collaborating with others is a powerful way to make a
 difference. 
Two biblical examples of persons who used their talents to
help others are David and Martha. David played his harp to
cheer up King Saul (1 Samuel 16). Martha cooked and clean
for her family and others (Luke 10).

It’s Harvest Time Again
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
     In the Old Testament there were festivals related to the gathering of crops;
for example, the Harvest Festival (Exod. 34:22). The Jews were to bring the first
grain of the harvest to God’s house. It was a time to honour God for His
blessings. 
     Harvest Thanksgiving is usually celebrated in the month of November in The
Bahamas. During this time, churches have special services when individuals bring
food items to church and share with those in need. Songs of thanksgiving are
sung. 
    
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 93 - 94
The celebration of special days and festivals is a common practice. Individuals
celebrate special days to observe traditions and create unity among people. Churches
celebrate special festivals in remembrance of Jesus and our relationship with Him. 
 During Harvest time many people give sacrificially to others. It may be 
               difficult for them to give but they do it because God honours  
                                    their sacrifice. Like the widow who  gave her last 
                                               coins in the Bible (Mark 12), individuals 
                                                      who give sacrificially will be rewarded 
                                                                              by God.

 The Birth of Jesus Christ -
Christmas
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
      Christmas is a very important festival for Christians. It is a time to reflect on
God’s love for the world and how He sent His only Son to die for mankind (John
3:16). Christmas is a celebration of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
      The birth of Jesus Christ was a special event. Mary and Joseph, Jesus’ earthly
parents were of humble means. Jesus was born in Bethlehem in a stable. The
angel told humble, poor shepherds the Good News that Jesus the Messiah was
born and they were the first who came to worship Jesus. Although Jesus was a
king, he had a humble birth.
       The world experienced great darkness (confusion) before Jesus Christ was
born (Isaiah 9:1-6) but when Christ was born he brought light, hope and joy (John
12:46). Jesus was born to be the Light of the World so that mankind would find
their way back to God amidst all of the turmoil in the world. (John 8:12) Jesus is
still the Light of hope for the world today.
       Christians are called to shine as lights in the world. Jesus said that believers
are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14 -16). Christians can be lights to others by
showing love and kindness and treating others with respect. They can help to
make the world a better place.

GRADE 4
Created to Worship
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Worship expresses a person’s reverence for God and it should be done sincerely.
According to Jesus, some people worship God “with their lips” but not with their
hearts (Matt. 15:8-9). Christians must have honest and sincere hearts when they
worship God. Our hearts should be clean and our spirits free (Ps. 51:10).
      The Three Hebrew Boys and David are examples of biblical characters who
worshipped God sincerely. The Three Hebrew Boys refused to worship the
golden image or idol because they reverenced God (Dan. 3:18). David played
music, danced and wrote many psalms in worship to God (2 Sam. 6:5). 
     Christians must show that they reverence God every day. When Christians
obey God, they are showing reverence to Him. Ways to reverence God daily
include:  
Sing songs of praise and worship  
Kneel down or bow in prayer to God  
Share with others  
Perform your daily jobs and tasks well  
Use your talents to help others.

Teach Us to Pray
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 99 - 100
     Jesus Christ shared the following teachings about
prayer:  Individuals must ask and seek God for what they
want (Luke 11:9-10)  God should be honoured before we
make petitions (Matt. 6:9-10)  Prayers done in secret will
be rewarded openly (Matt. 6:4) 
     Individuals should use the Lord’s Prayer (Matt. 6:9-13)
as a model for personal prayers. Our prayers should
begin in praise to God for who He is. Following this, we
should ask God to supply our daily needs and to forgive
our sins. We should pray in the name of Jesus. 
     As Christians grow in the faith, they grow in their
ability to pray. They can use their personal expressions
and words from the Psalms to pray. Words from Psalm
23, Psalm 121 and Psalm 51 can be used when we pray to
show that we believe what God has said. 
    There are many types of prayers. Prayers of petition
and thanksgiving are two types. Petition is asking God for
something (food, clothing and healing) for yourself or
someone else. Thanksgiving is giving praise to God for
what He has done. 
16


Christian Ceremonies
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Christian churches or denominations use different
styles of worship. Some churches conduct a
solemn style of worship with the use of an organ.
Members participate in singing, Bible reading and
the sacraments. In other churches there is a more
spirited style of worship with the use of varied
musical instruments. Some churches have worship
teams and large choirs.   
Some Christian churches follow a standardized
order of worship which includes the singing of
hymns, prayers, Bible readings, a sermon and the
Eucharist or Holy Communion. Other churches do
not follow a strict order of events. Services include
worship, prayer and a sermon. 
A very important component of church worship is
fellowship. The Bible encourages Christians to
assemble together and to encourage one another
(Heb. 10:25). This is also a time to express God’s
love for fellow believers. During the worship
service, some churches have fellowship or greeting
time. Romans 16:16 states, “Greet one another with
a holy kiss.” After worship, some churches have a
fellowship meal.

Caretakers of the Earth 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Ways to preserve and conserve natural resources include:  Recycling bottles,
cans, paper etc., conserving energy, protecting the trees and wetlands,
using less water, using Earth-friendly products.
Human beings were created to be stewards or to take care of the Earth. When
God created Adam, he placed him in charge of all the animals (Gen. 1:28). He
also instructed him to cultivate and guard the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:15).
Christians believe that the Earth belongs to God who created it (Psalm 24:1).
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 103 - 104
When Joseph became Prime Minister of
Egypt he developed a conservation
strategy that saved his nation. Based on
the Pharaoh’s dream, Joseph knew that
there would be seven years of plentiful
harvest and seven years of food shortage.
During the seven years of harvest. Joseph arranged for huge quantities of
grain to be stored. During the seven years when no crops grew, there was
sufficient food to feed the people of Egypt and others who needed help.
18


Helping /Serving Others 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Most of Jesus Christ’s earthly ministry was spent in service to
others. He willingly helped those who were sick, physically
challenged or possessed with demons. He wanted people to
know that God loved them. In John Chapter 13, Jesus washed
His disciples, feet to give them an example of how they should
serve others. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 105 - 106
Christians believe that a part of their purpose in life is to serve others. To serve
means“to give assistance or help.”Jesus Christ said if someone wants to be
great, he/she must be the “servant of the rest” (Matt. 20:26). When Christians
serve, they express the love of God within them and place the needs of others
first. 
The heart of a true servant is ready and willing to help.
True servants exhibit the Fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-
23). They are especially filled with joy, patience,
goodness and kindness. Galatians 5:13b states “let
love make you serve one another.” 
There are many ways in which individuals can
render service to others. Acts of service include
sharing your resources, using your talents to help
others, volunteering at a home, helping your
parents at home and praying for others in need. 
19


Taking Care of Me 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Physical and mental health are closely connected. When a person is
physically sick, this may affect his/her emotions. When something
challenging happens like sickness or death of a family member, a
person may lack energy and feel sad. When you exercise, your body
and mind feel stronger. If your body and mind are well, you will be
successful in school and get along with others.  
The Bible provides guidance about our physical and mental
health. The story of Daniel and his friends indicate how eating
a proper diet can help you be physically and mentally strong
(Daniel 1). The following scriptures encourage us to think
positive thoughts so that we can be healthy: Phil. 4:8;
Prov.17:22: Phil. 4:13. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 107- 108
Individuals should develop healthy habits in order to be healthy.
Ways to care for your physical health: eat healthy meals, drink water
and exercise. Ways to care for your mental health: pray to God, think
positive thoughts, talk to a friend, play music and do activities you
enjoy. 
Physical and mental health are very important in a person’s life. Physical
health is how well your body is functioning. Mental health refers to the
well-being of your mind and emotions. If you are physically and
mentally well, you will be able to cope with everyday issues you face.
20


The Value of Work
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
   It is very important for all human beings
to engage in some form of work. Work
helps individuals to be able to afford the
basic things they need (house, food and
clothes). Many individuals will also have
extra money to have fun and enjoy life.
More importantly, individuals should work
to express their talents and help others.  
When God created Adam and Eve, He placed them in charge of the world to keep it in
order. They had power over the fish, birds and all animals. They had to work with
their hands or perform manual labour. They took care of all the animals and plants in
the Garden of Eden. Adam even named all the animals (Gen. 1-2).
     People, in general, have a positive attitude towards
work. They view work as a means to obtain money and to
provide for their daily needs. People are satisfied at work
when they know their jobs well, get paid fairly, enjoy the
work environment, get along with their co-workers and
have a balanced life. Most people enjoy jobs where they
can serve others and use their talents. People may dislike
their jobs if the work is difficult, stressful and boring.

Be Fruitful  
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Since God created human beings, they have multiplied all
over the Earth and kept it under control. Today, there are
over seven billion people living on the seven continents
around the world. Most people live in China, India and
other parts of Asia. Years ago, people moved from Asia to
North America and South America. They made the new
land their home and had families there. In the early years,
many people died because of diseases and lack of food.
Today, there is better medical care and more food is
being produced so people live longer.
When God created Adam and Eve, He told them to“be fruitful and
multiply”or to have many descendants. He wanted them to“live all over
the Earth and keep it under control.”The scientific term for being fruitful is
reproduction. Males and females reproduce sexually and make more of their
kind.
The Bible teaches that all human beings descended from the first man and
woman, Adam and Eve. Genesis 3: 20 tells us that Eve was the “mother of
all human beings.” After, Adam and Eve were sent out of the Garden, they
had children, including Cain, Abel and Seth. Adam and Eve’s children
produced other human beings.

Families Are Special
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 113 114
The family is the main or central part of any society. It is the role of the
family to “teach children skills, morals and values” that will help them be
better citizens and play their roles in society. Children are greatly influenced
by their parents and extended family. 
Most of the moral values that Bahamian
families uphold are based on the Bible.
Parents teach their children to love God and
to love others, based on the Ten
Commandments (Exod. 20). Because of
respect for God’s laws, children also learn
to respect the laws of our country. Respect
for others is based on the Golden Rule (Luke
6:31). Children learn the value of hard work
because Scripture indicates that hard work
brings success (Prov. 12:11 and 27).
There are many traditions and values
that are common to all Bahamian
families. Family traditions include
going to church on Sunday,
celebrating festivals and holidays,
spending time with family and
showing kindness to strangers.
Bahamian families value hard work,
respect for the law, honesty and
getting a good education.

Families Build Communities 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
A family is a small community and its members must
work together. Father, mother and children must play
their roles and cooperate so that the family can
function effectively. When family members are well
behaved and happy, they function well in the wider
community. 
The Bible gives us examples of
healthy and unhealthy family
relationships. In the story, “The Baby
who Survived,” we have an example
of a supportive family. Moses’ family
members worked together to save his
life. He grew up with love and
support.  
A community is a group of people living or working together who
share common characteristics and interests (Webster). People of
different race, nationality and religion live in communities. Types of
communities include the family, school, church, clubs and
neighbourhoods. Small communities build larger communities. 
In the story of “Cain and Abel,” we
see an example of jealousy among
brothers that led to murder. Cain’s
behaviour disrupted his family and
caused evil to spread on the Earth.
From these stories we can see that
our behaviour affects our families
and the wider community, positively
or negatively.

A Community of Believers
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Churches are made up of different families. If families are
strong the church will be strong also. Family members help the
church by using their time, talents and treasure in Christian
service. Parents help the church by teaching their faith to the
younger generation thus helping the church to grow. 
A church is a body or organization of religious believers
(Webster). This group can be made up of individuals of different
nationalities and races. They form a community of believers who
meet regularly for worship and fellowship. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 117- 118
The Early Church was a closely connected group of
believers. They met in people’s homes for worship. They
loved one another and shared everything. Wealthy
believers who owned land sold it and gave the money
to the apostles to help the church. 
There are many benefits of belonging to a church
community. Individuals are a part of a group of people who
share their faith. They have an extended family to pray for
and comfort them in times of distress. They also have access
to counselling, money, food and other resources.

Journey through Holy Week
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The main events of Holy Week have great significance. 
Palm Sunday – Jesus Christ rode into Jerusalem on a donkey
 to show He was humble and peaceful. 
Holy Monday – Jesus honoured His Father by chasing the
 money changers out of the temple. 
Holy Thursday - Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper or Holy
 Communion, instructing His disciples to remember Hi
s sacrifice. Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsema
ne and was tried by the religious leaders. 
Good Friday - Jesus died on the cross to save us from our
 sins. 
Holy Saturday – Jesus remained in the grave awaiting His
 resurrection. 
There are Christian and secular traditions associated with Holy Week. Christian
traditions include prayer, fasting, attending Palm Sunday service, Holy
Communion and feet washing and Good Friday service. Secular traditions
include decorating eggs, spring cleaning and buying Easter lilies. 
Jesus Christ, who was without sin, suffered and died for the sins of the whole
world. His death symbolizes the greatest sacrifice that was made for mankind.
Christians believe that through the death of Jesus, their sins would be forgiven
and they would be brought back to God (I Peter 3: 17-18).

 Celebrating Easter
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The resurrection gives hope to believers that one day they will rise from the
dead. The physical body that dies will be raised as a spiritual body that lives
forever. Death will be destroyed forever. Christians will go to heaven to be with
God (1 Cor. 15:35-58). 
The resurrection of Jesus Christ is very significant to the
Christian faith. If Jesus was not risen from the dead,
then the believer’s faith is not real and he/she is still in
sin (1 Cor. 15:17). Jesus was victorious over death;
therefore, all believers can have eternal life. 
Christian symbols of Easter include the following:  The crucifix or cross
symbolizes the death of Jesus Christ. An empty cross means that Jesus was
victorious over death and is alive.  The lamb symbolizes Jesus’ sacrificial death.
Jesus was called the “Lamb of God.” Secular symbols include the following: 
Easter eggs symbolize the tomb that Jesus came out of when he was
resurrected.  Hot cross buns are decorated with crosses on them to symbolize
the crucifixion of Jesus.

Obeying Laws and Rules
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Follow
Follow
Rules and laws are guidelines for how people should
behave. They are based on what is considered right and
wrong. They guide our behaviour at home, in school and
in the wider society. Rules and laws help to keep us safe
and in order. They also help us show respect for others. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 123 - 124
There are many biblical teachings that guide
our behaviour. Scriptures about living in peace
include: Matthew 5:9; Romans 12:18 and Psalm
34:14. Scriptures about being honest include:
Prov. 12:22 and Eph. 4:25. Scriptures about
being kind include: Eph. 4:32 and Gal. 6:10.
The way individuals behave will cause them to
experience good or bad consequences. When we
follow rules at home, school or in the wider
community, we get rewards such as verbal praise and
treats. When we disobey rules, we are punished and
privileges are taken away. In the wider community, if
people break laws, they can pay a fine or even go to
jail. These consequences are very serious.

Factors that Influence Behaviour
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 125 - 126
An individual’s behaviour can be influenced by
factors such as friends, music and groups or clubs.
Friends can influence you to do good or bad
things. The music you listen to can cause you to
be calm, peaceful, angry or unkind. The clubs or
groups you join can also influence how you act.
The Bible contains stories and teachings to guide our behaviour. In the story,
“Four Friends Find a Way,” we learn about friends who influenced each other
positively. The following scriptures teach us about choosing the right path: Prov.
3:5-6; 4:5; 13:20.
There are many Bahamian traditions that have influenced our behaviour. Two
such traditions are storytelling and working together in communities. Through
storytelling, Bahamians share advice on how to behave. Bahamians have always
practised being good neighbours. Families share resources and help to raise the
children in the community. Some communities have neighbourhood watch
programmes. Bahamians also buy fruits and vegetables from street vendors in
the community.

Human Beings Have Rights 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights outlines the basic rights of human beings.
These rights are “rules for how we should treat each other: with dignity, respect,
equality and fairness.” They seek to enable all human beings to reach their full
potential.
Children are human beings so, they enjoy the basic human rights. However,
because they need extra protection, their rights have been outlined in a
special document called the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this
document, a child is identified as someone under the age of eighteen.
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 127 - 128
According to Scripture all human beings should be loved and protected.
Scriptures that are related to all humans include: Genesis 3:21; Prov.
31:8-9 and Col. 3:11. Scriptures that are related especially to children
include: Matt. 18:5-6; 19:14 and Eph. 6:4. 
The Child Protection Act of The Bahamas (2010) outlines laws for the
protection of children. Children are to be brought up in a safe
environment. Parents are responsible to protect them from neglect and
abuse. There is now an alert system for missing children (Marco’s Alert).

 Respect and Responsibility 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Respect is shown when individuals honour the feelings, wishes or rights 
of others. Respect requires that we honour our nationalities, individual 
differences and opinions. Individuals show responsibility when they“behave
correctly towards or in respect of others.” 
The Bible provides many scriptures about respecting others and 
their property. Scriptures about respecting people include: 
Matt. 7:12; I Peter 2:17; Phil. 2:3-4 and Matt. 19:19. The 8th and 10th
Commandments (Exodus 20: 15 and 17) teach us to respect people’s property. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 129 - 130
There are great Bible stories that teach us to show responsibility for
others. In the story, “Ruth Finds Work,” Ruth acted responsibly and
cared for her mother-in-law Naomi. In the story, “The Baby who
Survived,” Miriam diligently watched and cared for her baby brother
Moses. 
Practical ways to show respect and responsibility for others include the following:
Make friends with someone from a different nationality or culture  
Use polite words and good manners when speaking to anyone  
Ask permission to use people’s personal items

GRADE 4
Celebrating Pentecost/Whitsun  
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
When Jesus Christ left the Earth, He promised His disciples that He
would send the Holy Spirit to them. On the Day of Pentecost, the
Holy Spirit descended from heaven as a great rushing wind and
filled the room. The disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit and
spoke in other languages.
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 131 - 132
Pentecost/Whitsun was a Jewish holiday in the Old Testament. It was
originally called the Feast of Harvest or Feast of Weeks. It was a
time to celebrate the initial wheat harvest. The Jews offered to the
Lord two loaves of wheat bread made from the grain they harvested. 
The Early Church was greatly impacted by the coming of the Holy
Spirit. After Peter preached a message on the day of Pentecost, about
three thousand people were added to the church which increased
daily, as many individuals were converted. They met regularly for
prayer and fellowship. 
Pentecost is celebrated as the birth of the Christian Church.
Christians remember how the gift of the Holy Spirit was
poured out on the disciples. At Pentecost believers were
empowered by the Spirit for Christian service. The Holy Spirit
still empowers, comforts, guides and gives spiritual gifts to
believers today.

Christian Celebrations and Culture 
GRADE 4
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The major Christian festivals have helped to shape Bahamian
culture. Most of our holidays are connected to Christian
festivals. Other cultural activities such as going to church,
eating special foods, parades, concerts, regattas and even
Junkanoo are connected to Christian festivals. 
Bahamians are generally very respectful of our Christian traditions and customs.
We are faithful in attending church services during the various seasons. We
observe periods of solemn reflection and joyful celebration appropriately.
Christian festivals invoke feelings of unity and harmony among families are
communities. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 133- 134
“Culture is a pattern of behaviour shared by a society or group of people.”
Things such as food, music, art, traditions and religion make up our culture.
“Older people pass culture down to younger people.” It changes over time when
different cultures come together and with new technology (Britannica Kids).
