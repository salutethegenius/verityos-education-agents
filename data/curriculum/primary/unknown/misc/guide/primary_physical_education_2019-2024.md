This curriculum has been developed to assist in the dissemination of Physical Education activities and techniques.  It is hoped that this curriculum will assist all 
practitioners of the subject, especially our colleagues in the Family Islands, to improve their delivery of the subject.  It has been said that “the greatest gift that can be given, 
is the gift of knowledge” (author unknown). 
 
It is the hope of all of the professionals who assisted in the compilation of this work, that it will be a source of inspiration and a valuable tool in the tool-box of knowledge 
and instruction to all Physical Education instructors.

RATIONALE 
 
Physical Education is the nucleus of healthy lifestyles and caters significantly to the physically educated citizens. 
It is through this medium that an invaluable learning experience unfolds, allowing all learners to access the knowledge, skills and attitudes that shape their lives through 
this active learning process. 
 
This process of learning embraces the values placed on life and secures each individual in his personal experiences, as these experiences coincide with the stream of things, 
both cognitive and physical in every pursuit. 
 
We must continue to be cognizant of the fact that the needs and experiences of our youth must not be ignored in our planning, for it is through their experiences and 
enjoyment of movement that they will find Physical Education enjoyable.  Regular physical activity is pertinent to the development of the “whole man “.  For children, it is 
through this kind of physical activity and movements that they zoom in on their lives as a whole, critical to all aspects of their development, including the psychomotor, 
cognitive and affective domains.  Therefore, the well-being of individuals depends greatly on the soundness of the Physical Education programme. 
 
In the structured Physical Education programme, consideration must be given to the level of safety of the learners, so as to provide a nurturing environment that would 
enable the development of functional levels of activity, including specific motor skills and functional physical fitness.  The learners Physical Education experiences and 
development must be geared towards appropriate values, personal and social behaviors. 
 
In summary, each individual learner should be progressively assessed in order that their needs are met, providing the opportunity for all to partake in these unique 
experiences equally. 
 
It must therefore be observed, that Physical Education should not be confused with the activities of private sports clubs, sports organizations, or inter-school athletic 
competitions, because these function only to complement this process.  Physical Education is a structured well-balance programme which provides the physically educated 
persons with exciting experience from the knowledge of its nature, skills and developed positive attitudes from its practice; engendering daily routines and leisure pursuits 
through life. 
 
A well-structured and vibrant physical education programme is essential in our Nation as we are in pursuit of excellence.  This active learning will foster personal growth of 
the individual through Physical Education, therefore enhancing the skills necessary to meet the challenges of an ever-changing society. 
 
Thus, an investment in the Physical Education of our children is an investment in the long-term health and prosperity of our Bahama land for years to come.

PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
 
The new direction of Physical Education at Primary level is to provide all students with a safe, enjoyable and nurturing environment where physical activity and the 
development of motor skills will be enhanced.  Each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her potential through the acquisition of knowledge, and skills 
that will transfer to a healthy lifestyle and lifelong sports.  The base of the Physical Programme is Body Management Competence, which gives focus to the development of 
fundamental skills that lead into specialized skills training.  Primary students will also participate in the core sports such as Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, Soccer 
and Track and Field.   Interschool competitions take place in all of the “core sports” aforementioned including, Mini- tennis.  It is the responsibility of the New Providence 
Primary School Sports Association in collaboration with the Department of Education and the various Sports Factions to organize and conduct the competitions, 
reinforcing the principles of fair play, sportsmanship and self-control. 
 
 
 
 
 
1.

CONTENT STANDARDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
1. Demonstrates competency and proficiency in movement forms. 
The intent of this standard is to develop competence and proficiency in movement.  In preparation for adulthood, students should have acquired the basic skills to 
participate in a wide variety of leisure and work- related physical activities and advance in at least two or three areas. 
 
2. Apply movement concept and principles to learning and development of motor skills. 
This standard concerns the ability of the learner to use cognitive information to understand and enhance motor skills.  By graduation the student should have developed 
sufficient knowledge and ability to independently use their learned behavior to acquire new skills while continuing to refine existing ones. 
 
3. Exhibits physically active lifestyles. 
The intent of this standard is to establish patterns of regular participation in meaningful physical activity.  This standard should connect what was done in physical 
education classes with the lives of students outside of class. 
4. Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 
This standard is for the student to achieve a health-enhancing level of physical fitness.  Student should be encouraged to develop higher levels of basic fitness and 
physical competence as needed for many work situations and active leisure participation.  Students should have both the ability and the willingness to accept 
responsibility for personal fitness leading to an active, healthy lifestyle. 
 
5. Demonstrates responsible personal and social behaviors in physical activity settings. 
Achievement of this standard includes safe practices, adherence to rules and procedure, etiquette, cooperation and teamwork, and positive social interaction. 
 
6. Show respect for differences among people in physical activity settings. 
The intent of this standard is to develop respect for individual similarities and differences through positive interaction among participants in physical activity.  
Similarities and differences include characteristics of culture, ethnicity, motor performance, disabilities, physical characteristics (strength, size, and shape), gender, race 
and socioeconomic status.  
 
7. Recognize that physical activity opportunities are for enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. 
As a result of these intrinsic benefits of participation, students will begin to actively pursue lifelong physical activities that meet their own needs.

RESOURCE/MATERIALS 
ASSESSMENT 
By the end of  grades  5  - 
6,  students will be able to: 
 
-Recap from grades 3 and 
4 
 -      Demonstrate concern 
for the care and safety of 
others and for equipment. 
 -      Demonstrate basic 
gymnastic skills in a 
simple routine on floor 
and apparatus. 
- 
Create patterns and 
combinations of 
movements into 
repeatable sequences. 
- 
Demonstrate balance 
and control on a 
variety of moving 
objects (e.g., balance 
boards, skates etc.). 
- 
Create a variety of 
body actions to move 
into and out of a 
variety of transfers of 
weight from feet to 
hands with large 
extensions e.g. 
stretching legs wide; 
torso twisting; rolling; 
curving feet over to 
Recap from grades 3 and 4 
 
1.  TRANSFER OF WEIGHT 
a.    Rocking from one body part to  
       another. 
b.    Rolling from one body part to  
       another 
c.     Feet to hands – head up when  
        moving onto equipment, arms     
        take weight first. 
d.    Spring takeoffs (Flight) – Jump    
       from one foot to two feet; push    
       off the balls of the feet, soft   
       landings. 
 
ii. BALANCING 
a.  Base of support- the higher your  
     center of gravity from the ground  
     or equipment the more difficult it  
     is to balance. It is harder to balance  
    when  your bases of support are far    
    away  from or outside your center      
    of 
gravity. 
Counter-balance 
involves  
     a wide base of support and pushing  
    against each other. Counter-tension  
    involves a narrow base of support  
    and pulling away from each other. 
b. Static- tight muscles keep the center 
of gravity over base of support. 
c.  Dynamic- keep the center of gravity  
 
1. Provide opportunities for students 
to explore different movements on 
the mats individually and in groups. 
 
2. Use stations and task cards to 
help students create routines. 
 
3. Have students review a DVD or 
videotaped performance of a 
gymnast. Watch it once without 
stopping, then rewind and stop at 
various points to initiate discussion. 
Emphasize techniques performed in 
class. 
 
4. Have students balance in pairs, 
using given examples of counter 
balance and counter tension. Ask if 
they can move while pushing or 
pulling against each other. Then ask 
them to try in groups of three or 
four. E.g. 1. Sitting back to back 
with elbows joined, stand up and sit 
down without moving the feet.  
 
5. Have students face their partner, 
palms against each other at shoulder 
level, inch the feet away from the 
center. How far can they get 
without falling?

transference in various 
ways off low 
equipment or 
apparatus into floor 
level, starting with 
hands on floor. 
- 
Demonstrate the use 
of balances to move 
smoothly into and out 
of different transfers 
of weight. 
- 
Demonstrate a spring 
take off and then 
transfer weight from 
the feet to hands onto 
low-medium 
equipment apparatus – 
beam, bench, table, or 
large tire. 
- 
Demonstrate weight

     over bases of support.. 
d. Inverted- tight muscles, behind up. 
     Keep the center of gravity over the    
      bases of support. 
 
ROTATION - rolling, turning, 
cartwheel 
 
 
6. Partners holding each other’s 
wrists, with feet close together, can 
they shuffle the feet sideways and 
move in a circle? 
- 
Challenge students to transfer 
weight from their feet to hands 
in a variety of ways on 
 the ground. 
 
6. GOLDEN NUGGET #1: 
During an obstacle 
course/circuit work the 
teacher will place a long 
jump mat with numbers on 
them . This will be use as 
station for jumping skills by 
practicing a forward and 
backward jump for distance. 
The teacher will explain 
that the jumping/landing 
skill is inherent to proper 
body control and that the 
backward jump task is the 
first step in teaching a back-
hand spring. This 
propulsion in a backward 
plane is an important part of 
the skill. Landing is a vital 
part – If a student is off 
balance in a backward 
motion, it will give the 
student an opportunity to 
learn how to fall properly 
and incorporate another 
lead up skill (back roll , egg 
roll, shoulder roll ) all skills

SPRINTS 
- 
Sprinting ranges from the 50 meters the 
400 meters.  Sprinting consists of two 
basic principles: stride length and stride 
speed.  There are three parts of effective 
sprinting: the start, efficient running form, 
and the finish.  Each of these basic parts of 
the total sprint effort has essential 
demands.  Sprinting form is a very 
individual matter because of differences in 
body builds. However, fundamental 
running movements can be portrayed in 
general terms of correct foot placement, 
arm action, shoulder and head angles, body 
alignment, and leg and knee action. 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Emphasize the toes pointing straight 
ahead, as opposed to in or out, for efficient 
running. 
ARM ACTION 
-

MIDDLE DISTANCE EVENTS  
 
As the distance increases from sprints to middle 
distance events, running form changes; strides are 
shorter, the foot strike is more toward the ball of 
the foot rather than on the toes, arm carriage is 
lower and less vigorous in middle distance 
training, there must be more running. Runners 
should start by building on slow, long distances 
through intervals with short recovery periods.  
Distance runners should run relaxed, 
concentrating on a steady, even-paced rhythm.  
The basic essentials of efficient running involve: 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Foot should be pointed straight ahead.  
The foot strike is more the ball of the 
foot. 
 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms play a balancing role in running 
- 
The arms should be kept at a 90 degree 
angle with thumbs up. 
- 
As the arms move forward and back in 
position, they should never pass higher 
than the chest on the forward move and 
never further than the hips. 
- 
The arms should never cross the middle 
of the body. 
Body alignment  
- 
Once running speed is achieved, the 
body’s angle tends toward the 
perpendicular. 
- 
The body is held almost erect with the 
shoulders and face relaxed. 
- 
There should be little or no rotation in the 
- 
Done 50% pace.  
 
- 
Concentrate on endurance, 
strength, speed and breathing.

upper body. 
 
Stride Length 
- 
The slower the speed of the arm, the 
shorter the stride. 
- 
Longer strides require more energy: in 
distance running where economy of 
energy is important, runners should take 
natural strides. 
 
Breathing 
- 
The runner should keep the jaw relaxed 
and breathe through the nose and mouth 
simultaneously. 
 
Relays in track and field today 
There are two common types of relay in primary 
school track and field.  They are:  
i. 
4 x 100 Meter Relay 
ii. 
4 x 400 Meter Relay 
- 
All relay events consist of four runners. 
- 
All four runners need to understand Baton 
handling, border positions and zone 
awareness. 
 
4 x 100 Meter Relays 
- 
The four runners who make up the relay 
team must stay in their designated lane for 
the entire race. 
Each runner will have to run 100 meters 
before handing off the Baton.

- 
The head should be straight ahead with 
eyes focused on the finish line. 
- 
The face (jaws and facial muscles) should 
be relaxed. 
 
BODY ALIGNMENT 
- 
The runner should rise up on his or her 
toes and lean forward to where a position 
of balance is barely maintained: that is the 
correct body angle.  Forward angle is best 
when accelerating. 
 
LEG ACTION AND KNEE LIFT 
- 
The Knees should be raised sharply 
forward and upward and then brought 
down with vigorous motion followed by a 
forceful push by the toe.

The sprinter should run on the balls of the 
foot, using a pushing action to get drive 
against the surface of the track.

As the distance increase from sprints to middle 
distance events, running form changes; strides are 
shorter, the foot strike is more toward the ball of 
the foot rather than on the toes, arm carriage is 
lower and less vigorous.  In middle distance 
training, there must be more running. Runners 
should start by building on slow, long distances 
through intervals with short recovery periods.  
Distance runners should run relaxed, 
concentrating on a steady, even-paced rhythm.  
The basic essentials of efficient running involve: 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Feet should be pointed straight ahead.  The 
foot strike is more on the ball of the foot. 
 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms play a balancing role in running 
- 
The arms should be kept at a 90 degree 
angle with thumbs up. 
- 
As the arms move forward and back in 
position, they should never pass higher 
than the chest on the forward move and 
never further than the hips. 
- 
The arms should never cross the middle of 
the body. 
Body alignment  
- 
Once running speed is achieved, the body 
angle bends toward the perpendicular. 
- 
The body is held almost erect with the 
shoulders and face relaxed. 
- 
There should be little or no rotation in the 
upper body. 
 
Stride Length 
- 
The slower the speed of the arm, the

shorter the stride. 
- 
Longer strides require more energy: in 
distance running where economy of energy 
is important; runners should take natural 
strides. 
 
Breathing 
- 
The runner should keep the jaw relaxed 
and breathe through the nose and mouth 
simultaneously. 
Relays 
- 
In track and field today there are two 
common types of relay in primary school 
track and field.  They are:  
iii. 
4 x 100 Meter Relay 
iv. 
4 x 400 Meter Relay 
- 
All relay events consist of four runners 
- 
All four runners need to understand Baton 
handling, border positions and zone 
awareness. 
 
4 x 100 Meter Relays 
- 
The four runners who make up the relay 
team must stay in their designated lane for 
the entire race. 
Each runner will have to run 100 meters before 
handing off the Baton.

LONG JUMP 
- 
The key to an effective successful jump is how high 
the jumper can raised his or her center of gravity. 
- 
Long Jump is performed on a Long Jump runway, 
which is normally 40 meters in length and 1.25 
meters in width. 
- 
The jumper’s landing area is called a “Pit” which is 
located at the end of the Long Jump runway.  It is 
usually 3 meters wide and filled with soft damped 
sand. 
- 
The “Pit” with the take-off board should be level 
plain 
- 
There are two types of Long Jump techniques used 
in elementary schools.  These  are: 
(c ) Standing Long Jump 
(d)  Running Long Jump 
 
STANDING LONG JUMP 
- 
This type of jump is made with both feet.

By the end of grades 5 – 6, 
students will be able to: 
 
- Demonstrate how the shot 
put is held in the base of the 
fingers as explained by the 
teacher. 
 
- Given the visual aid, explain

SHOT PUTT 
There are three types of phases in shot putt, These are: 
- 
Initial Phase 
- 
Glide Phase 
- 
Final Phase 
- 
Throw Phase 
 
INITIAL PHASE 
- 
The student’s back is facing the direction of the 
throw 
- 
The weight of the body is on the  left or right leg 
- 
The trunk of the athlete is lowered and the heel of 
the supporting leg is lifted slightly off the ground. 
 
GLIDING PHASE 
- 
The athlete vigorously extends his right leg while 
driving back from the sole and then to the heel.  
- 
The left leg is strongly kicked back to the stop board 
- 
The right foot is turned anti-clockwise as it leaves 
the ground while the left foot reaches for the ground 
near the stop board. 
- 
Both feet land on their soles 
- 
The trunk leans back and the weight is carried on the 
right leg. 
 
FINAL PHASE 
- 
The right foot and knees are turned to the front 
facing the stop board of the Shot Putt circle 
- 
Drive the hips forward and upward as the legs are 
being extended 
- 
The body weight is evenly distributed between the 
feet 
1. Have students 
experiment how they must 
practice each phase 
individually. 
 
2.  Pair up students; have 
them take turns observing 
each other’s initial phases. 
3.  Have students practice 
their gliding phase using 
small round balls. 
 
4.  Allow students to 
practice the proper way to 
enter and exit the shot putt 
circle. 
 
5.  Practice throwing the 
small ball to improve the 
various phases. Alternating 
between various styles 
(glide or travel across the 
ring). 
 
6. Practice lower leg push 
to gain power for the 
throw. 
7. Practice throwing the 
shot trying to get it to a 
certain target.

PRACTICAL VOLLEYBALL SKILL TEST 
 
 
Parallel line is drawn through the middle of the court.  Each half is further subdivided into three equal areas by lines drawn parallel to the sidelines.  This gives six areas 
numbered 1 - 6 and which compares to the playing stations.  Each student is allowed one attempt to serve the ball into each of the six areas in turn.  Two points are awarded 
for serving into the designated court area.  One point is given for missing the designated area. 
 
 
Bumping 
 
 
 
- 
Keep it up, Repetitious hitting 
 
 
Bumping for accuracy passing  
- 
To a setter or hitting a prescribed target.  
 
 
Court layout for service testing 
 
 
Wall volleying – Player stands behind a line four (4) feet away from a wall.  A line representing the height of the net is drawn on the wall about six and half feet (6.5) up.  
Players are asked to make as many volleys as they can in one (1) minute.  If a student steps over the line in a volley, or if the ball goes lower than the mark on the wall, that 
volley does not count.  This test can be administered for the underhand pass (bump) and the overhead pass (flick). 
 
 
Simplified serving-- Students stand in the normal serving position behind the line on any side of the court.  The score is the number of successful serves out of ten trials.  
Each serve that clears the net counts as one.

Throwing: 
Use the arm as a guide as you throw the ball 
over the right shoulder towards a fielder, 
wicket keeper and the stumps.  Opposite 
action for left hander. 
Step with foot opposite to the throwing hand.  
Throw the ball waist height to the receiver. 
 
Catching    
Observe the ball from above the head into the 
cupped shaped hands close the hands on 
contact and pull it towards the body. 
 
Bowling 
Step forward with opposite foot and hand as 
you bring the ball from waist level with a 
straight hand and release just above the 
shoulder level.  
Bowl to hit the stumps. 
Fielding 
When fielding a rolling ball kneel with one 
knee on the ground and the other at right 
angle to help block the ball.  Hands are 
cupped together in contact with the ground to 
get the ball effectively. 
When running to field the ball, if one cannot 
get to the proper fielding position, use the 
foot to stop the ball from reaching the 
boundary for extra runs.  Never step over the 
boundary when catching a ball or the 
opposing team will get the extra runs. 
 
- 
Children run designated distances 
from box to box known as a safe zone.  
First on command and secondly to 
avoid being tagged with a soft sponge 
ball e.g. Children are divided into two 
teams.  The first team is divided into 
the two boxes.  The second team is 
scattered around the designated play 
area.  The team in one of the boxes 
throws the ball anywhere into the play 
area; the children must run from one 
box to the other without being tagged 
with the ball.

effectively. 
 
 
 
- 
Score the game of cricket. 
 
 
- 
Know the boundaries 
 
 
- 
Understand the ways to

Batting 
Stand with feet shoulder width apart gripping 
the handle of the bat.  If you can’t swing the 
bats, block the ball with the bat. 
Always wear protective mitts, leg pads, cups 
and if necessary a helmet to prevent injuries 
while batting. 
 
Running between the wickets 
 
As a batter hits the ball and it appears that a 
run can be made, he runs to the opposite end 
sliding his bat into the cease, as does his 
partner.  After hitting the ball the batter must 
keep the bat in his hand while running 
between the wickets, the bat must be 
grounded as he reaches the crease at the 
opposite end until the foot reaches the crease 
 
Wicket Keeping 
The wicket keeper must always wear 
appropriate pads and gloves  to prevent the 
balls not hit by the batters  passing him to go 
for runs. 
Catches all balls he can get to within his 
range. 
Stumps the batter out should he be out the 
crease as he receives the ball in the rear of the 
stumps. 
 
Scoring 
A run is scored when both batters cross over 
and reach the opposite crease before a fielded 
ball is thrown and hits the stumps.  You may 
score more than one run when running.  This 
depends upon the amount of times the batters 
cross over and reach their crease successfully.

Should a ball be hit and rolls along the 
ground to the boundary before being fielded 
or even if it comes in contact with the fielder 
and rolls there, this is scored as four runs and 
there is no need to run. 
Should a ball be hit and makes no contact 
with the ground before going in the back 
boundary, it is scored six runs. 
 
Extra runs: 
 
If a bowler’s front foot lands in front of the 
crease as he delivers a ball, it is called a “no” 
ball and scored as one, four or six as hit by 
the batter. 
Should a bowler deliver a ball out of the 
batter’s range, it is called a wide ball and can 
be scored as one run or four runs should it 
reach the boundary. 
 
Byes 
If a ball is bowled, the batter makes a play, 
misses it and it passes the wicket keeper, the 
batter can run for as many runs as possible; 
should it not hit the boundary, it can only be 
scored as four runs. 
 
Leg Byes 
Should the ball hit the batter’s pad while he 
attempts to hit it, he and his partner may run 
as many runs as possible, providing it does 
not hit the boundary to be scored as four 
runs. 
 
Placing the ball when batting, the batter has 
the option to hit the ball in any direction.  He
