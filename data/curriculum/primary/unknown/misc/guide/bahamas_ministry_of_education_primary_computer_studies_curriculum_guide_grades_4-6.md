In our globalized environment, education has taken on a new focus. The increasingly digitized and 
automated society is dependent on knowledge and understanding of digital systems and confidence in 
how to manage changes. Digital systems such as mobile and desktop devices and the Internet are 
transforming learning, recreational activities, home life, and work. These devices support new ways of 
communicating, collaborating, and developing new skills such as computational thinking. Computer 
studies is an essential toolset in our ever-evolving society. 
  
The Bahamas Primary Computer Studies curriculum empowers students to engage in change by 
influencing how current and emerging technologies and practices are used to meet current and future 
needs. Computer studies provide students with practical opportunities to become global collaborators, 
innovative designers, knowledge constructors, and creative communicators. 
  
To aid in developing the curriculum’s framework, the committee reviewed curriculum documents 
generated in various jurisdictions. These countries included the United Kingdom, the United States of 
America, Canada, Australia, India, and The Bahamas. The documents from these countries were 
examined to determine the format used for the Scope and Sequence and Scope of Work.  
  
The curriculum is intended to be utilized by elementary teachers throughout The Commonwealth of 
The Bahamas as a framework for developing engaging and meaningful learning experiences. It includes 
standards, objectives, targeted skills, course content, suggested activities, enduring understandings, 
and assessment methods. The aim is to provide standardized instruction in technology to all primary 
students and to ensure students are exposed to foundational technology concepts that can be 
reinforced and extended upon entering junior high school.   
  
As the world of technology is constantly changing, Computer studies must stay aligned with its 
advancement. A timespan of five (5) years has been allotted for this document, with updates rendered 
yearly to keep up to date with advancing technologies and our rapidly evolving society. 
  
Learning in the 21st century has seen a significant shift, much of it due to the rapid innovations in the 
development of technology. It is anticipated that this curriculum will meet the educational and social-
emotional needs of all students while also developing technological competency to meet international 
educational standards.

Computers are becoming an integral part of our lives in today’s global and technological world. As we 
interact with technology every day, it is prudent that primary students learn about it. All students 
should be made aware of the possibilities that technology offers and the value it can have on their 
education. Research has shown that technology can enhance the teaching and learning process and aid 
in developing life-long skills. With many occupations requiring applicants to have at least a basic 
knowledge of computers, the demand for learners to be technologically literate is becoming 
painstakingly evident. Consequently, the primary goal of this curriculum is to foster critical thinking and 
problem-solving skills that comprise the foundations of computer studies.   
 
The effective use of technology in education has achieved tremendous success in keeping students 
motivated and engaged in the learning process. It is desired that the computer studies curriculum is 
interconnected with various subject disciplines while exposing our students to new and exciting 
technological innovations. We seek to inspire and motivate students to pursue excellence in all 
academic endeavors and develop appropriate attitudes, values, and behaviors that will augment our 
Bahamian culture; as they keep abreast of new trends and technologies available in education.  
 
We will continue to strive to advance our pedagogic approach and the resource tools utilized. We 
endeavor to prepare our students to work, live, and compete in a technologically demanding society. 
This necessitates the development of a computer curriculum that will prepare our students with the 
most promising strategies possible, providing them with the requisite knowledge and skills to facilitate 
their overall academic development and growth. Thus, the overall aim of this curriculum is to motivate, 
inspire, stimulate, and generate excitement for technology in education, which will hopefully endure 
throughout the student’s academic life. 
 
The Primary Computer Studies Curriculum is in alignment with the International Society for Technology 
Education (ISTE), which highlights the broad areas of technology. Listed below are components from 
the curriculum that support progressing from using technology to learn to transformative learning with 
technology: 
 
 
Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of 
computer studies 
 
Develop and empower innovative learners   
 
Encourage collaboration and digital citizenship 
 
Develop computational thinkers 
 
Influence creative digital communicators

This curriculum is created as a guide and should not be followed indiscriminately but used as an outline 
to create a program of study for each grade level. Teachers and school districts should use this 
curriculum as a starting point to develop lesson plans, exercises, and assessments that support each 
stated objective and that will best suit their students. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced (I), 
reinforced (R), or maintained (M). Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts 
with at least 56% accuracy, as stipulated by the Department of Education.  
 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide 
assists teachers in planning for the year to include all the content necessary for meeting the standards 
in teaching computer studies. 
 
Although each topic is presented independently, many are interdependent and require integration with 
the content of other topics or subjects. Teachers are encouraged to link topics as appropriate and 
present topics in an order, speed, and depth that meet the needs of their students, while giving equal 
emphasis to all concepts and skills. There are unlimited combinations, and each teacher should put 
together lessons that allow students to make sense of the material presented.  
 
If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use 
other avenues in the document to allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills.

There is no concrete definition of a best practice when it comes to technology; it depends on where you 
work, who your students are, and many other variables. In this guide, the term ‘best practices’ refers 
not to the use of technology but its effective application. 
 
The ISTE Standards provide the competencies for learning, teaching, and leading in the digital age, 
providing a comprehensive roadmap for the effective use of technology in schools worldwide. 
Grounded in learning science research and based on practitioner experience, the ISTE Standards ensure 
that using technology for learning can create high-impact, sustainable, scalable, and equitable learning 
experiences for all learners. 
 
ISTE Standards are used around the world as policy and implementation guides. The ISTE Standards 
aim to develop educators’ digital literacies and pedagogical practices that harness technology for 
learning (International Society for Technology in Education, 2022). 
 
Some suggested practices include: 
 
 Using project-based learning activities 
 Incorporating game-based learning 
activities 
 Including interactive whiteboards with 
student response systems 
 Integrating virtual tours, simulations, 
and web-based exploration 
 Student-created videos, podcasts, 
slideshows, blogs, and more 
 Collaborative online tools 
 Instructional materials presented in a 
visual format 
 Providing adequate and timely 
feedback 
 Allowing student choice 
 Student Self-Assessment 
 Peer Assessment 
 Scaffold learners’ use of the Internet, 
social networking, and new media 
 Linking to student’s prior knowledge 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies 
 Opportunities to discover and invent 
new knowledge in technology 
 Whole class discussion 
 Emphasizing the real-life relevance of 
information technology 
 Revision of the instructional plan based 
on student progress 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and 
creativity to keep them motivated 
 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES IN COMPUTER STUDIES 


 
Bahamas Ministry of Education Primary Computer Studies Curriculum Guide

Go to Table of Contents 
 
 
 
 
Assessment should support the learning of information technology, provide useful information to both 
teachers and students, and should be more than a test at the end of instruction to gauge learning.  It 
should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning.  Therefore, 
teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, 
writing tasks, and other means. Teachers can make sound decisions about reviewing materials, re-
teaching a difficult concept, and providing additional material for students who are struggling or need 
enrichment.   
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for 
future use and should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. For students to excel, they 
must be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the computer studies curriculum. 
 
Students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all the cognitive levels of 
learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956) identified six levels within the cognitive domain, which must be 
acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from 
remembering facts, at the lowest level to creating material which is the highest level of the taxonomy.  
These levels range from remembering facts as the lowest level to 
creating material as the highest level (Exhibit 1).  
 
Over the years, these levels have been translated into digital environments, providing greater scope for 
the effective integration of technology. Bloom’s Digital Taxonomy was devised by Andrew Churches 
and focuses on the use of ‘power verbs’ in teaching and learning with technology (Exhibit 2). 
 
As computer studies is a practical field, assessments should allow for students to create products to 
demonstrate their skills and knowledge of concepts. Evaluations of these products can be done through 
self-assessment, peer assessment, or teacher assessment. Whichever method is chosen, ensure that 
rubrics are provided to guide the evaluation process.

Within this curriculum, there is room for learning based on students’ individual needs. The word 
differentiation is a crucial, wide-ranging aspect in terms of exceptional education and for its association 
with students who struggle.  
 
All students may need some type of differentiation assigned to their individual learning based on their 
unique circumstances; like the gifted student, the student whose work is never perfect enough, the 
bored student, or the one who overthinks.  These are all examples of exceptional learners. 
 
When educators value all modes of diversity encountered in the educational setting to teach students 
who are remarkably gifted with students who are academically challenged and those with a specific 
need, the stage is set for social-emotional and academic success.  
 
Below are some strategies for exceptional learners in the computer studies classroom. 
 
 Use of choice boards allows students to select the best method to convey their learning and 
understanding. 
 
 Use of pre-recorded lessons allows students to view and learn at their own pace. 
 
 Use of spell checking and grammatical tools allows students who struggle with written 
communication to be independent. 
 
 Use of text-to-speech, magnification, and augmentative communication tools allows students 
with handicaps to engage in activities and whole group discussions. 
 
Other strategies include: 
 
 Cooperative learning 
 Project-based 
learning 
 Gamification 
 Peer Teaching 
 Additional time to 
complete tasks 
 Timely feedback

Four groups that hardware 
components can be divided 
into are: 
  
- Input Devices – used to 
enter data into the 
computer. Data can be 
letters, numbers, sounds, or 
images. Examples: mouse, 
keyboard, stylus, smart 
pencil, touchscreen, joystick, 
remote control, touchpad, 
scanner, digital camera, web 
camera, microphone, 
drawing tablet, and 
interactive whiteboard. 
  
- Output Devices – used to 
hear and see information 
from the computer. You use 
an output device to see or 
hear information from the 
computer. Information can 
be sound through speakers, 
art displayed on the screen, 
or text and graphics on a 
paper. Examples: monitor, 
screen, printer, speaker, 
headphones, and projector. 
  
 
 
- Storage Devices – used to 
save work to be retrieved 
later. Examples: flash drive, 
CD, DVD, hard drive,

Process-Output (IPO) cycle: 
  
- We use an input device to 
enter data into a computer. 
This data is called the input. 
  
- The CPU converts the data 
into meaningful

processing.  
  
- After the data is processed, 
the result is conveyed 
through an output device. 
This is the output.5

Software are instructions 
that tell the computer what 
to do. There are two main 
types: system software and 
application software. 
  
System Software are the 
programs that run behind 
the scenes to ensure the 
computer functions 
properly, like the operating 
system and utility programs. 
Examples: Windows 10, Mac 
OS, iPad OS, Android, and 
Linux.2 
  
Application Software are 
the programs used to 
perform specific computer 
tasks. 
  
Applications are also used 
on smartphones and tablets 
to do lots of things, such as 
social networking, listening 
to music and messaging. 
  
The word ‘app’ is short for 
application software. This is 
a piece of software that 
allows us to do an everyday 
task.4

Digital devices operate by 
following a list of 
instructions, called a 
program, that has been 
written to carry out a 
particular task.13  
 
Programming is writing 
code to create a program, to 
solve a problem.14  
 
It involves writing 
commands to tell the device 
to do something in a 
programming language it 
can understand.15 
 
Programming languages 
have been specially 
designed, with a limited set 
of instructions, to tell 
computers what to do. 
Some languages are more 
suitable for some purposes 
than others. 
 
Regardless of what 
language they use, 
programmers must become 
adept at specifying exactly 
what they want the 
computer to do. Unlike 
human beings, a computer 
will carry out instructions to 
the letter even if they are 
patently ridiculous. It is 
important that programs 
are well written.13

Computational thinking 
means planning, problem-
solving, and analyzing 
information the way a 
computer does.17 
 
The cornerstones of 
computational thinking are 
decomposition, pattern 
making, abstraction, and 
algorithms. 
 
 
Vocabulary 
1. decomposition: 
break a problem 
down into smaller 
pieces 
2. pattern making: 
finding similarities 
between things 
3. abstraction: pulling 
out specific 
differences to make 
one solution work 
for multiple 
problems 
4. algorithm: a list of 
steps that you can 
follow to finish a 
task13 
 
Each cornerstone is as 
important as the others. 
They are like legs on a table 
- if one leg is missing, the 
table will probably collapse. 
Correctly applying all four 
techniques will help when 
programming a computer.16

A model is a representation 
of something in another 
form. Example: A map 
represents the streets in a 
city or the geography of an 
area. A calendar represents 
the days in a month and the 
months in a year. A 
restaurant’s menu represents 
the food they serve. It takes 
the place of showing the 
customers the actual food. 
 
Each of these models are an 
abstraction of the thing it 
represents. 
 
We can use models to help 
us figure out how to solve 
problems or find ways to 
improve an existing 
solution. 
 
Models can be used to 
represent steps in a process, 
a set of information, or the 
solution to a problem. 
 
A flowchart is a model that 
represents an algorithm as a 
series of connected steps. 
They help to organize the 
steps in a process into a 
specific order.19 
 
Show students a display of 
models and have them 
identify what they 
represent. Examples: team 
roster = member of a sports 
team; floor plan = layout of 
a house; street map = layout 
of a city.

An algorithm is simply a set 
of steps used to complete a 
specific task. They're the 
building blocks for 
programming, and they 
allow things like computers, 
smartphones, and websites 
to function and make 
decisions. 
 
In addition to being used by 
technology, a lot of things 
we do on a daily basis are 
similar to algorithms.17 
 
Examples of algorithms in 
everyday life are: recipes, 
traffic lights, GPS, brushing 
your teeth, and planting a 
seed. 
 
When something is not 
working in a program/code, 
it’s called a bug. Finding, 
identifying, and fixing the 
problem is called 
debugging.17

Resources 
 
Scratch is an environment 
where you can build 
algorithms by combining 
code blocks together. 
 
You can create interactive 
stories, animations, 
artwork, and games. 
 
There are three main 
sections of the Scratch 
interface. 
 
On the left-hand side we 
have tools to control or 
change our characters. The 
main way is through our 
code blocks.  
 
There are different types of 
block categories or ways to 
control our characters.  
 
We can also change the way 
our characters look under 
the “costumes” tab. 
 
We can also add sound 
under the “sounds” tab. 
 
In the middle we have our 
scripts area. This is where 
we put together code blocks 
to create our algorithms, or 
instructions, for our 
character.  
 
We “drag and drop” the code 
blocks we want to use.  
 
The code blocks are shaped 
like puzzles to help you know 
 
Have students view the 
‘Scratch Basics’ video. 
Discuss products that can be 
made in Scratch, and the 
method used. 
 
Open a New Project (click 
on “create” on the top left) 
and explain the different 
components of the Scratch 
Interface. Have students 
view the Exploring Scratch 
3.0 sheet of the student 
workbook as a 
reference. [Individual] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pair and Share: Have 
students share with a 
partner what they would like 
to create in Scratch. Have a 
few students share their 
thoughts with the class.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested Assessment(s) 
Resources 
 
Behind all the software we 
use daily, there's a code 
being run with all sorts of 
terms and symbols.  
 
Surprisingly, it can often be 
broken down into three 
simple programming 
structures called sequences, 
events, and loops.  
 
These come together to 
form the most basic 
instructions and algorithms 
for all types of software. 
 
A sequence is a series of 
actions that is completed in 
a specific order. Action 1 is 
performed, then Action 2, 
then Action 3, etc., until all 
the actions in the sequence 
have been carried out. 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students watch the 
‘What is a Sequence’ video. 
[0:00 – 2:23] 
 
 
Have students share 
activities that follow a set 
sequence. Examples: 
brushing your teeth, 
washing your hands, baking

Events are actions that 
cause something to happen 
like when you click on a play 
or pause button. 
 
Two examples are a knock 
on the door or the ringing of 
the telephone. 
 
When using digital devices, 
events lets them know what 
to do or show. 
 
Using input devices, we 
communicate to our 
devices. With a stroke of a 
key or a press on the screen 
we activate a command. 
 
Events in coding also are 
actions that cause 
something else to happen.  
 
Inquiry prompt 
Can you name event blocks in 
Scratch? 
 
 
 
A Scratch event block tells a 
script to run. A script in 
Scratch should always begin 
with an event block.20

Resources 
 
A loop is a sequence of 
instructions that is 
repeated. 
 
Loops allow programmers 
to efficiently code repetitive 
tasks instead of having to 
write the same actions over 
and over again. 
 
If one wanted to draw a 
square, a loop can be 
written that states ‘go 
straight, then turn right’; 
have it repeat four times 
instead of writing eight lines 
of code. 
 
Introduce the concept of 
loops with the ‘Loopy 
Dance’ activity. 
 
Have students think of 
everyday activities that 
contain repeated steps. Use 
loops to make them easier 
to complete.

A computer is made up of 
many parts that work 
together. 
  
The parts of the computer 
that can be seen and 
touched are called 
hardware.2 
  
Each hardware component 
has a specific job it does to 
help the digital device work. 
  
Five groups that hardware 
components can be divided 
into are: 
  
- Input Devices – used to 
enter data into the 
computer. Data can be 
letters, numbers, sounds, or 
images. Examples: mouse, 
keyboard, stylus, smart 
pencil, touchscreen, joystick, 
remote control, touchpad, 
scanner, digital camera, web 
camera, microphone, 
drawing tablet, and 
interactive whiteboard. 
  
 
 
 
 
- Output Devices – used to 
hear and see information 
from the computer. You use 
an output device to see or 
hear information from the 
computer. Information can 
be sound through speakers, 
  
Have students watch the 
video ‘Computer Devices’.

Resources 
  
A computer helps us 
generate information from 
raw data.  
  
It follows the Input-
Process-Output (IPO) cycle: 
  
- We use an input device to 
enter data into a computer. 
This data is called the input. 
  
- The CPU converts the data 
into meaningful 
information. This is called 
processing.  
  
- During the processing, the 
data or information are 
stored in the computer’s 
memory 
  
- After the data is processed, 
the result is conveyed 
through an output device. 
This is the output.5 
  
Have students watch the 
‘How Does a Computer 
Work?’ video. 
  
  
Have students complete a 
Quizizz identifying the

Resources 
  
Software are instructions 
that tell the computer what 
to do. There are two main 
types: system software and 
application software. 
  
System Software are the 
programs that run behind 
the scenes to ensure the 
computer functions 
properly, like the operating 
system and utility programs. 
  
An operating system is the 
most important software 
that runs on a computer. It 
manages the computer's 
memory and processes, as 
well as all its software and 
hardware. Without an 
operating system, a 
computer is useless.9 
  
Application Software are 
the programs used to 
perform specific computer 
tasks. 
  
They can be divided into 
two groups – general 
purpose and special 
purpose. 
  
 
General Purpose software to 
carry out lots of different 
tasks using that application. 
  
 
Special Purpose software

Coding is writing commands 
to tell the computer to do 
something in a 
programming language it 
can understand. 
  
To start coding, you have to 
know a programming 
language, but you also have 
to understand how a 
computer thinks so that you 
can give it the right kinds of 
instructions. 
  
Code is a special language 
that a computer 
understands. An algorithm 
written in code is called a 
program.20 
  
Examples of Coding 
Languages  
  
- Scratch: a visual coding 
system that uses colored 
blocks and premade graphics 
to create games and apps.  
  
- Lego Mindstorms NXT: a 
language used by the FIRST 
Robotics League  
  
- Python: a general-purpose 
language that can be used 
for different tasks  
  
- HTML/CSS: These are 
markup languages and not 
programming languages. A 
markup language is a way to 
design and present text.

Computational thinking 
means planning, problem-
solving, and analyzing 
information the way a 
computer does.17 
  
The cornerstones of 
computational thinking are 
decomposition, pattern 
making, abstraction, and 
algorithms. 
  
  
Vocabulary 
1. decomposition: 
break a problem 
down into smaller 
pieces 
2. pattern making: 
finding similarities 
between things 
3. abstraction: pulling 
out specific 
differences to make 
one solution work 
for multiple 
problems 
4. algorithm: a list of 
steps that you can 
follow to finish a 
task13 
  
Each cornerstone is as 
important as the others. 
They are like legs on a table 
- if one leg is missing, the 
table will probably collapse. 
Correctly applying all four 
techniques will help when 
programming a computer.16

Computer scientists use 
algorithms to plan out the 
steps they want a computer

Algorithms can be 
represented as pseudocode 
or a flowchart, and 
programming is the 
translation of these into a 
computer program.  
  
If an algorithm has been 
designed, the computer 
program will follow this 
algorithm, step-by-step, 
which will tell the computer 
exactly what it should do.

You can create interactive 
stories, animations, 
artwork, and games. 
  
There are three main 
sections of the Scratch 
interface. 
  
On the left-hand side we 
have tools to control or 
change our characters. The 
main way is through our 
code blocks.  
  
There are different types of 
block categories or ways to 
control our characters.  
  
We can also change the way 
our characters look under 
the “costumes” tab. 
  
We can also add sound 
under the “sounds” tab. 
  
 
 
In the middle we have our 
scripts area. This is where 
we put together code blocks 
to create our algorithms, or 
instructions, for our 
character.  
  
We “drag and drop” the code 
blocks we want to use.

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested Assessment(s) 
Resources 
  
A loop is a sequence of 
instructions that is 
repeated. 
  
The repeat loop block in 
Scratch looks like a 
sandwich. All of the blocks 
inside the loop (sandwich) 
are run in order (sequence) 
and  
  
repeated the number of 
times listed in the repeat 
oval. 
  
  
Inquiry Prompt 
What kinds of things can 
you program Sprites to do 
using loops?  [moving, 
jumping, changing color, etc]  
  
  
Just like in real life, in order 
for these actions to occur in 
a computer program, 
animation is needed to 
show them happening. 
  
Animation cycles through a 
sequence of images of the 
characters that look slightly 
different. As you move 
quickly through the pictures, 
it looks like the character is 
moving. 
  
Animation in programming 
works the same way that we 
think of animation in real

A computer is an electronic 
device that manipulates 
information, or data. 
  
Computers come in many 
shapes and sizes, and they 
perform many different 
functions in our daily lives.  
  
Computers exist in many 
digital devices that we use 
on a day-to-day basis. 
  
  
When you withdraw cash 
from an ATM, scan groceries 
at the store, or use a 
calculator, you're using a 
type of computer. 
  
Desktop Computers 
Computers designed to be 
placed on a desk and used in 
that spot. They need a 
constant supply of 
electricity to function. 
  
 
 
 
Laptop Computers 
Battery-powered all-in-one 
computers that are more 
portable than desktops, 
allowing you to use them 
almost anywhere.

A computer is made up of 
many parts that work 
together. 
  
The parts of the computer 
that can be seen and 
touched are called 
hardware.2 
  
Each hardware component 
has a specific job it does to 
help the digital device work. 
  
Five groups that hardware 
components can be divided 
into are: 
  
- Input Devices – used to 
enter data into the 
computer. Data can be 
letters, numbers, sounds, or 
images. Examples: mouse, 
keyboard, stylus, smart 
pencil, touchscreen, joystick, 
remote control, touchpad, 
scanner, digital camera, web 
camera, microphone, 
drawing tablet, and 
interactive whiteboard. 
  
- Output Devices – used to 
hear and see information 
from the computer. You use 
an output device to see or 
hear information from the 
computer. Information can 
be sound through speakers, 
art displayed on the screen, 
or text and graphics on a 
paper. Examples: monitor, 
screen, printer, speaker, 
headphones, and projector.

A computer helps us 
generate information from 
raw data.  
  
It follows the Input-
Process-Output (IPO) cycle: 
  
- We use an input device to 
enter data into a computer. 
This data is called the input. 
  
- The CPU converts the data 
into meaningful 
information. This is called 
processing.  
  
- During the processing, the 
data or information are 
stored in the computer’s 
memory 
  
- After the data is processed, 
the result is conveyed 
through an output device. 
This is the output.5

Software are instructions 
that tell the computer what 
to do. There are two main 
types: system software and 
application software. 
  
System Software are the 
programs that run behind 
the scenes to ensure the 
computer functions 
properly, like the operating 
system and utility programs. 
  
An operating system is the 
most important software 
that runs on a computer. It 
manages the computer's 
memory and processes, as 
well as all its software and 
hardware. Without an 
operating system, a 
computer is useless.9 
  
Application Software are 
the programs used to 
perform specific computer 
tasks. 
  
  
They can be divided into 
two groups – general 
purpose and special 
purpose. 
  
 
General Purpose software to

The cloud (cloud computing 
or cloud storage) is the 
Internet - more specifically, 
it's all of the things you can 
access remotely over the 
Internet. When something is 
in the cloud, it means it's 
stored on Internet servers 
instead of your computer's 
hard drive. 
  
Two main reasons people 
use the cloud are 
convenience and reliability. 
They can store files, share

An algorithm lists the steps 
needed to complete a task. 
Computer scientists use 
algorithms to plan out the 
steps they want a computer 
to follow.  
  
Programs are created to 
implement algorithms. 
  
Algorithms can be 
represented as pseudocode 
or a flowchart, and 
programming is the 
translation of these into a 
computer program.  
  
If an algorithm has been 
designed, the computer 
program will follow this 
algorithm, step-by-step, 
which will tell the computer 
exactly what it should do. 
  
Examples of algorithms in 
everyday life are: recipes, 
traffic lights, GPS, brushing 
your teeth, and planting a 
seed.

Scratch is an environment 
where you can build 
algorithms by combining 
code blocks together. 
  
You can create interactive 
stories, animations, 
artwork, and games. 
  
There are three main 
sections of the Scratch 
interface. 
  
On the left-hand side we 
have tools to control or 
change our characters. The 
main way is through our 
code blocks.  
  
There are different types of 
block categories or ways to 
control our characters.  
  
We can also change the way 
our characters look under 
the “costumes” tab. 
 
We can also add sound 
under the “sounds” tab. 
  
 
 
In the middle we have our 
scripts area. This is where 
we put together code blocks 
to create our algorithms, or 
instructions, for our 
character.  
  
We “drag and drop” the code 
blocks we want to use.  
  
  
Have students view the 
‘Scratch Basics’ video. 
Discuss products that can be 
made in Scratch, and the 
method used. 
  
  
Open a New Project (click

Selections are a bit different 
than sequences. 
  
Instead of following a 
specific order of events, 
they ask a question in order 
to figure out which path to 
take next. 
  
These questions are known 
as conditional statements. 
They tell the program what 
to do in the event the rule 
cannot be followed. 
  
A rule is something that 
tells your program the 
direction to run. 
  
A condition is an exception 
to a rule. It tells your 
program to change. It can 
be a true or false statement 
  
A loop with conditions is a 
loop that continually checks 
if a condition is true. 
  
Sensing entails noticing (or 
identifying) when a specific 
condition is true.

Loops with conditions use 3 
types of blocks in a script to 
control the actions of a 
sprite: a “forever” loop 
block, an “if then” 
conditional block, and a 
Sensing block.  
  
  
The “if then” condition is 
defined by using a Condition 
block with a blue Sensing 
block. The Sensing block 
tells the program to “sense” 
if the sprite is touching a 
color, touching another 
sprite, or if a key on the 
keyboard is pressed.20

A robot is a mechanical 
device that can be 
programmed to follow a set 
of instructions. Robots have 
processing units, sensors to 
help them perceive things in 
the surrounding 
environment, and motors 
and actuators so that they 
can move. Robots may also 
have the added 
programmable functionality 
of lights, sounds or speech 
recognition.21 
  
  
  
Harold the Robot 
In this activity children 
simply give directions to a 
“robot” (teacher/student) 
and find out which 
instructions the robot is able 
to follow, and how their 
instructions are taken 
literally: 
 
 1. Place a small collection of 
blocks/similar objects on a 
desk. 
 2. One person (perhaps the 
teacher or other adult for a 
start) plays the role of 
Harold the Robot. Harold 
can only respond to 
particular commands. These 
 commands are not given to 
the  
children, and can be made 
up on the fly. 
 
 3. Have a child talk Harold 
through making a tower out 
of the blocks using 
instructions such as “Move 
your hand to the left”, “Pick 
up the block beside 
 your hand” and so on. If the 
child gives an instruction 
that is too complex or 
otherwise not in Harold’s 
vocabulary (e.g. “put the 
three blocks on top of each 
 other”) then Harold 
expresses confusions by 
shaking his head or burying 
his head in his hands. 
4. The task is completed 
when the tower is built. At

code using sequences, 
events, and loops, to 
program ‘Harold the Robot’.

A formula is a calculation 
using numbers in a cell. 
Using a formula to calculate 
values allow you to focus on 
the data and allow Excel to 
automatically recalculate 
the results, if the data has to 
be changes. 
 
To begin a formula in any 
cell, it must begin with the 
equal (=) sign/symbol. Then 
a cell address, a 
mathematical operator, 
then another cell address. 
Example: = B2+C3 
 
Enter a cell address into a 
formula by typing it directly 
into the cell. By clicking on 
the cell to be included. The 
cell into which you enter a 
formula will display the 
result. 
  
Note: the formula will be 
seen in the formula Bar.
