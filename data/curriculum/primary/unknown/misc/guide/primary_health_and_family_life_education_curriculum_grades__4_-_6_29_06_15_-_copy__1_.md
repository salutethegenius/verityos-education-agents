MESSAGE FROM THE MINISTER 
 
“The curriculum is the reason there are schools. 
Everything else…schedules, budgets, 
vision statements…is just support.” 
                                                                                                                                                              Mary Brady – The Real Basics 
 
I have always believed in the transformative power of education, particularly in a developing country, and I strongly support the government’s commitment 
to the orderly growth and sustainable development in education.  Indeed, because of the role of the curriculum in the provision of quality education, I am 
honoured to sanction and present revised national curricula in several disciplines.  This curriculum revision exercise has been an ongoing, successful 
collaborative effort.  Each curriculum was developed by a team of intelligent, innovative and hard working education officers who received invaluable input 
from teachers, students, parents and community partners. 
 
In keeping with the changing demands of higher education, life and work in the twenty first century revised curricula have moved away from a content-
based and knowledge-focused approach.  The new documents focus on higher – order thinking skills, cross curricula understanding, collaboration, creativity 
and real world problem solving.  Subject specialists and curriculum writers have included those activities which take into account the diverse learning styles 
of students and their various ability levels. 
 
Classroom teachers will be responsible for implementing these curricula that subscribe to the philosophy that all children can learn and perform best when 
they actively construct knowledge and understanding.  I am particularly pleased that at each grade level there are clear processes and procedures which 
allow teachers to align instructional strategies and classroom-based assessments to agreed international standards and benchmarks. 
- 
Our public and private sector stakeholders in education have approved our curriculum design which ensures that goals, objectives, skills and teaching – 
learning strategies represent high level expectations for student performance.  To be successful in today’s society, students at every level of schooling must 
be encouraged and supported by all teachers, administrators, parents and other education partners. 
 
The publication, dissemination and successful implementation of these curriculum guidelines will further unite us in our efforts to create people of character 
who are committed to life-long learning and who are always willing to serve. 
 
 To the classroom teachers and subject specialists, who are devoted to transforming the lives of students throughout The Bahamas, thank you for your 
continued contribution to our country!

Minister of Education, Science and Technology

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that 
will equip them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by 
Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They 
are respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as 
that state of well-being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of 
all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human 
development. This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration 
with Government Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will 
include sensitization and training for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit 
will coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, 
substance abuse prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage 
pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be 
conducted to address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles 
through training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. Life is the most valuable, natural possession to be nurtured and protected at all times by everyone. 
 
2. The stabilization of family is the key to the management of most of the social problems. 
 
3. Health is essential to the well-being of all individuals. 
 
4. Academic achievement and student health and well-being are inextricably linked. 
 
5. HFLE, with its emphasis on prevention and multi-disciplinary approaches, has the potential to address many of the social problems and 
impact behaviors and lifestyles. 
 
6. HFLE aims to address the whole child and to nurture emotional, physical, mental and moral development. It takes into account both 
affective and cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome. 
 
8. HFLE is the means by which positive values, attitudes and behaviors, knowledge and skills can be taught. The core skills, which the 
young develop within HFLE, can be translated into all areas of their lives. 
 
9. HFLE creates an atmosphere of trust, openness, sincerity and honesty, which contributes to positive interpersonal relationships. 
 
10. HFLE draws heavily on the experiences of students and educators and deals with young people in the context of home, school and 
community relationships.  
 
11. HFLE produces individuals who, cognizant of their roles in society, will make a positive contribution to national, regional and 
international development.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in 
learning, the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the 
development of individuals and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many 
important social, cultural and health issues in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown 
that confident, well-informed and well-supported young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the 
lifelong acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In 
order for individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address 
issues and risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs), HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse 
and drug dealing, negative sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, 
Sexuality and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is 
interrelated and has been developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary 
methods. Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of accurate knowledge, skills development and exploration of values and attitudes. Health and 
Family Life classes afford students opportunities to build competencies for healthy self-development to deal with the challenges of life as well 
as make positive contributions to national, regional and international development. 
 
Finally, the activities and ideas presented in this document are not exhaustive.  You may be able to find many more to match the lesson topics 
and the specific objectives.  Please feel free to do this and share your ideas with other teachers for the enrichment of the programme and the 
development of our children.

Traits are the physical characteristics or 
qualities (mental, emotional and social) 
that make a person special. 
 
Traits can be inherited and acquired. 
Inherited traits are passed on to individuals 
from their parents e.g. the ability to play a 
musical instrument, being great in sports, 
being good in a foreign language, etc.  
 
Acquired traits are characteristics that 
people develop as a result of life 
experiences and engaging in activities over 
time. One might become a skilled player 
because they acquired an interest in the 
activity and practiced until they perfected 
it.  
 
Individual interests, skills and talents make 
a person unique or different from others.  
Complete a self-inventory identifying their interests and 
hobbies. Share findings with the class.

A disability is a mental or physical condition that prevents the 
body from working, as it should.  
 
People have different forms of disabilities. 
- Physical disabilities include: blindness, deafness, speech 
defects, paralysis (cripple), etc. 
- Emotional disturbances and mental retardation are forms of 
mental disabilities.  
 
A disability is not a disease that can be spread to another 
person.   
 
People who have disabilities want to be treated with respect, 
care and understanding. 
 
They also want to be independent and do as much for 
themselves as they can. 
 
Good citizens see disabilities as opportunities to learn more 
about people and their challenges. 
Level 1: Compile a list of ways they 
can show respect toward others. Share 
their lists with classmates.  
 
Level 2: Create posters promoting 
ways to be more caring to people who 
are different from them.  
 
Level 3: Interview someone in the 
school or community who is disabled.  
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
Have students portray a disabled 
person for a class period or a day. Let 
them write about their experience and

Protection from abuse  
Any form of abuse is against the law and should be reported.  
 
Article 34 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child provides protection from any form of sexual abuse.   
 
It is important to report sexual abuse to a trusted adult. 
Always say ‘NO’, get away and seek help.  Reporting these 
abuses also raises awareness about pedophiles in the 
community. 
 
Sometimes, it is okay for others to touch private parts e.g. 
parents, doctors or nurses sometimes need to touch private 
parts when they take care of you or examine you for health 
reasons.  
 
Most touching done by adults is good touching, but children 
need to know what to do when someone touches private 
parts inappropriately. Children should not keep 
‘inappropriate touching’ secret.

sticker or flyer to demonstrate

TEACHING AND  
EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
A sexually transmitted infection (STI), also know as sexually transmitted 
disease or venereal disease (VD) is an infection that is spread through sexual 
contact. Anyone who has sexual contact with another person is at risk of 
getting an STI. 
 
Some common STIs are: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis (Bad Blood), 
Genital Herpes, Hepatitis B and HIV.  
 
Many STIs can be cured with medicines; some have no cure. Genital Herpes 
and HIV do not have a cure. Treatment for Genital Herpes with an antiviral 
drug makes outbreaks less severe. Drug treatment for HIV improves the 
quality of life and survival time for patients. 
 
Common Symptoms of STIs 
- Sore, blisters or swelling around the penis or vagina 
- A burning feeling when passing urine 
- Unusual liquid comes out of the vagina or penis. It is sometimes smelly  
 
A person can have an STI and not notice any signs. You cannot tell who has 
an STI or HIV by looking at them. 
Level 1: Describe how 
STIs are spread and list 
some symptoms and 
treatment. 
 
Level 2: Research some 
common STIs and list the 
causes, symptoms, effects 
and treatment.

Choosing foods that contain nutrients and in the right 
proportions is important to maintaining good health and 
preventing diseases.  
 
Special Nutrients (Micronutrients) 
Minierals such as vitamins, minerals and water are classified as 
micronutrients nutrients because they are needed in small 
amounts in the body. 
 
Vitamins are nutrients that help the body do certain jobs.  
- Vitamin A prevents infection, keeps the eyes moist and the 
hair and skin shiny  
- Vitamin C prevents infection, keeps the skin healthy and 
heals wounds. It also helps the body absorb iron.  
- Vitamin D keeps bones and teeth strong. This vitamin is also 
produced by the sun. 
- Vitamin E slows down cell damage 
- Vitamin K controlls blood clotting

The Food Guide Drum and Dietary Guidelines reflect both 
the culture and food choices relevant to The Bahamas *  
 
The Dietary Guidelines show how many servings an 
individual should eat from each food group each day.  
 
A serving is a standard amount food recommended for a 
meal or snack.  It is used to give advice about how much 
to eat or to identify how many calories and nutrients are in 
a food.  
 
A portion is the amount of food an individual chooses to 
eat. There is no standard portion size. A portion may 
contain more than one serving.   
 
It is important to control portion sizes to maintain a 
healthy and balanced diet. Always use serving sizes as a 
guide when selecting foods.  
Level 1: Explain the difference between 
food servings and portion size.  
 
Level 2: Explain why it is important to 
control portion size.  
 
Level 3: Conduct a survey of the portion 
size served by the school lunch 
programme.  
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
Have students demonstrate the correct 
serving size for various food items.

All human beings grow and develop in a given sequence 
but at different rates.  
 
Puberty is the period during adolescence when the body 
begins to develop and change.  Puberty usually starts 
between ages 8 and 13 in girls and 10 and 15 in boys.  
Everyone begins puberty at his or her own pace.  
 
During puberty, male and female hormones are released 
into the blood stream. Hormones are chemicals that 
cause body growth and physical, emotional and mental 
changes. 
 
Physical Changes and Development:   
Physical changes during puberty affect the way the body 
looks. These changes can be dramatic and disturbing   
- Oily skin/acne 
- Sudden growth  
- Sometimes clumsy   
- Increased perspiration and body odor  
Level 1:  List the changes that occur in 
boys and girls during puberty.  
 
Level 2: (a) Label where changes occur 
on male and female diagrams. (b) Create 
a personal checklist of the changes 
expected to occur as a result of puberty. 
 
Level 3: (a) Create a Venn diagram that 
records the changes experienced by 
boys, by girls and by both. (b) Discuss 
why puberty begins at different times 
for each person.

HIV is a virus which stands for (Human Immune-
deficiency Virus). When this virus attacks the immune 
system, it makes it weak and unable to protect against 
infections and diseases.  
 
HIV is different from most of the other communicable 
diseases because it is a STI and requires contact with 
body fluids such as blood, saliva, urine, etc. It has no 
cure, or vaccine to prevent it.  
 
Transmission of HIV: 
HIV is carried by body fluids such as blood, semen, 
vaginal fluids and breast milk of an infected person. It 
is generally passed on through:   
- Unprotected sexual intercourse;  
- Blood transfusion / Sharing needles; 
- An infected woman to her baby during birth, or 
through breast-feeding   
Level 1: Define terms related to 
HIV and AIDS.

Non-transmission of HIV:   
The HIV virus does not pass through the air. You can 
not get it from being in the same room with an infected 
person.  
You can not get it by touching or hugging, sharing 
pencils or hairbrushes or even food.   
The HIV virus causes AIDS which stands for Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  People with AIDS die 
from other diseases they get such as pneumonia and 
cancer. 
 
Prevention of HIV and AIDS:  
Make choices that keep you healthy  
- Abstain from sex until you are an adult or married  
- Never use drugs. They impair your judgment  
- Have one faithful sexual partner

EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
Any natural event that causes widespread injury, death and property 
damage is known as a natural disaster e.g. hurricane, storm, tornado, 
flood, earthquake, and Tsunami.   
 
Every year hurricanes, storms, tornadoes and floods occur in The 
Bahamas. Knowing what to do during these natural disasters could 
mean the difference between life and death.  
 
A hurricane is a storm that forms over tropical areas of oceans and can 
move inland. In a hurricane, rain is heavy, and winds blow greater than 
75 miles per hour. 
 
A tropical storm also forms over tropical areas of oceans. Wind speeds 
vary between 40 and 75 miles per hour.  
 
A tornado is a violently rotating funnel-shaped column of air associated 
with a thunder storm. Signs such as dark greenish sky, large hail and a 
loud roar occur. Tornadoes can form quickly without warning.  
  
Hurricanes and thunder storms can cause major flooding especially in 
low-lying areas.  
Level 1: Identify the natural 
disasters that occur on their island.  
 
Level 2: Describe natural disasters 
and their effects on families and 
communities.   
 
Level 3: Identify agencies that 
respond to natural disasters.

Aging is a part of the natural cycle of life. (Review Grade 
4, Standard 2.1: the Human Life Cycle). 
 
As people age, they may have to adjust to physical 
limitations (hearing loss, paralysis, blindness), mental 
dysfunction or social adjustment (loneliness, empty nest).  
 
People are worthy of love, care and respect no matter what 
their age or condition of health.  
 
Society can provide support and services for individuals as 
their physical, mental and emotional abilities decline with 
age. 
- Family members can provide support as caregiver, friend, 
adoption, etc.  
- Children and teens can find opportunities to become 
  involved in the lives of older adults e.g. volunteering at  
  senior citizens homes or daycare, advocating for 
  enforcement and changes to laws that protect the 
  rights of senior citizens.   
Level 1: Design a poster to discourage 
discrimination against older adults.

In order to understand what sex is all about and how pregnancy 
occurs, it is important to know the functions of the male and female 
reproductive systems.  
 
Male Reproductive System   
The male sex organ is the penis.  Behind the penis is the scrotum, 
which is a skin sac that holds the two testicles (also known as testes) 
that make sperm and the male hormone, testosterone.  
 
Once a young man starts puberty, his body is able to make sperm.  
From this point on, he is able to get a female pregnant.  The sperm 
are made in the testes (testicles).  The testes also produce the male 
hormone, testosterone.   
 
After sperm are made, they travel through tubes in the epididymis, 
where they mature and are stored.  If the sperm are not ejaculated 
from the body, they will be reabsorbed.  During sexual arousal, the 
sperm travel through the vas deferens to the prostate, where fluid is 
added. The fluid plus sperm makes up semen.   
 
Level 1:  Define vocabulary 
words from the lesson  
 
Level 2:  List the parts and 
functions of the male and female 
reproduction systems  
 
Level 3: Outline the process 
leading to pregnancy 
(conception)

Ejaculation is when this semen comes out of the penis 
through the urethra during sexual activity.  Only 
semen (no urine) is released during ejaculation. 
When a man becomes aroused, the penis fills with 
blood and stiffens.  This is known as an erection.  
During puberty, young men begin an erection while 
they sleep and release semen.  This often called a wet 
dream. The clinical name is Nocturnal Emission.  
 
Female Reproductive System   
The female reproductive system contains a uterus, 
ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, Clitoris, labia and 
vagina. 
 
The ovaries produce eggs and hormones called 
estrogen and progesterone.   
The fallopian tubes are connected to the uterus.    
The fallopian tubes pick up the eggs produced by the 
ovaries.   
Levels 1 – 3 cont’d:

inside the uterus until the baby’s birth.   
The clitoris is located in front of the urethral opening and contains 
sensitive nerve endings.   
The labia are the skin folds around the urethral and vaginal openings 
The vagina is the tubular opening from the uterus to outside the body 
through which the baby travels when it is born.  The vagina is also 
where sperm from the penis are deposited during sexual intercourse. 
 
At puberty, the ovaries begin to release eggs and menstruation 
(monthly periods) starts. The uterus builds up its lining with extra 
blood and tissue to provide protection for a fertilized egg to grow into 
a healthy baby. 
 
If a sperm from the male does not fertilize the egg, it passes through 
the vagina along with the extra blood and tissue from the uterus as a 
menstruation period, which usually lasts from 5 to 7 days.

exploitation to everyone under18 years.  
 
Two forms of exploitation are: Pornography and Social Networking. 
 
Pornography is any visual depiction (photographs, films, videos, 
pictures, computer generated images or pictures) made or produced to 
exploit an individual in sexual acts or in a lewd manner.  
 
Impact of Pornography 
- Child prostitution 
- Early exposure to sexual activity 
- Abnormal views of sex 
- Little trust for adults 
- Suicidal behaviors 
-  Loss of focus/withdrawn, low self-esteem and feelings of  
   worthlessness

One of the basic human needs is food. Food is important to life.   
 
The kind of foods eaten and their nutritional value have direct effect on 
one’s health and well being. Therefore, it is important to eat healthy foods.   
 
Food choices are influenced by the following factors: 
- Location (Where people live)   
- Cultural patterns and social interaction: (traditions festivals, 
homecomings, family gatherings,  ) 
- Eating habits (bingeing, overeating, hunger)   
- Accessibility (Income, purchasing power) 
- Availability (local production, imports)  
- Advertisements   
- Food preparation (Fried, baked, jerked, boiled) 
 
No one food gives all the nutrients that the body needs to stay healthy, so it 
is best to eat a variety of different foods everyday.  
 
The foods that make up the daily food requirement should be low in fat and 
high in vitamins, minerals and fiber.  
Level 1: Identify the factors 
that influence an individual’s 
food choices.

extra fat and skin on meat products should be trimmed and low fat 
cooking methods such as baking, roasting and broiling should be chosen.  
- Foods eaten should include: the correct serving from the food groups 
(a serving is the standard amount that is listed for each food and is used 
to help give advice about how much to eat or to identify how many 
calories and nutrients are in the food).

Human beings are made up of different shapes and sizes. Body image 
includes the way people see themselves as well as the way they 
believe others view them.   
 
During adolescence, children become more concerned about their 
appearance. (Review puberty in Theme II Sexuality and Sexual 
Health)  
 
Factors that influence body image 
- Self-esteem and self-acceptance: Feeling good about self promotes 
  a positive self-image.   
- Social pressures: People try to change their appearance to become 
  popular or to look like others   
- Cultural beliefs and practices: Body size (In some cultures, being  
  fat is unhealthy, whereas people from other cultures believe the  
  opposite), physical appearance, hair, skin colour, etc.  
- The media often promotes ‘the perfect body’ in advertisements,  
   magazines, on TV, etc.   
- The pressure to conform with society’s rules and norms can  
  increase a person’s health risk

Renewable resources: 
Renewable resources are part of nature and form our eco-systems (living 
and non-living organisms). 
Renewable resources include: oxygen, water, forests, plants, fruits, 
vegetables and animals. These resources are renewable as long as they 
are monitored, protected and conserved.  
 
Renewable resources are endangered by industrial development 
(agriculture, large scale fishing, mining and manufacture) and growth 
(population expansion, migration, buildings and road construction). 
  
Renewable resources must be used carefully so that they can renew 
themselves 
 
Non-renewable resources: 
A non-renewable resource is a natural resource which cannot be 
produced, grown or generated; once depleted there is no more available 
for future needs.  
 
Non-renewable resources include: fossil fuel e.g. coal, natural gas and 
petroleum (crude oil); minerals e.g. copper.

APPENDIX II 
 
 
TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices; and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, 
values and attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. 
However, teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit 
grades which will contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. 
(sharing thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills) 
• Field trips 
• Internships 
• Community Services 
 
Assessment Procedures 
 
Students are assessed based on the following: 
 
Class work and Homework   
60% 
 
Projects and Portfolios  
 
40% 


 
96
 
Health and Family Life Education Resource / Information Centre 
 
Each classroom should have a resource or information centre in which information on health issues and students’ work are displayed. Health 
and Family Life materials and activities can also be incorporated into the learning centres in primary schools. 
 
Listed are some suggested resources that will make Health and Family Life Education classes more interactive and interesting: 
 
• Computer Software 
• Transparencies on health issues   
• Games and Puzzles  
• Reality dolls 
• Puppets 
• Posters / Charts 
• Videos, DVDs and Audio Cassette tapes on health issues 
• Pamphlets  
• Brochures  
• Guest Speakers  
• Media sources  
 
Health and Family Life Education Services 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit provides the following services in New Providence and the Family Islands. 
 
• Workshop and sensitization sessions for teachers, parents, students and the public 
• Resources on health issues 
• Peer leadership training 
• HIV Prevention and Basic First Aid training  
 
Partnerships 
 
The Health and Family Education Unit collaborates with parents, school personnel, Government and Non-Government organizations to provide 
wholesome programmes for students. These activities are designed to help them gain the required knowledge, skills, values and attitudes so that 
they will graduate from the education system as fully functioning, self-confident, responsible individuals.

APPENDIX III 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will 
be time for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, 
role play, games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication, 
negotiation, assertiveness and cooperation. 
 
12. Ensure that grades are recorded in the mark book for the topics taught (date, topic, and number grade) 
 
13. Establish interactive learning centres in the classroom which should include current teaching aids and samples of students’ activities.  
 
14. Create instructional and motivational bulletin boards/charts that reflect the concepts and skills being taught e.g. family patterns, body parts, 
hygiene, drug abuse prevention, conflict resolution, HIV, AIDS STIs,  nutrition, environment issues, self esteem, teamwork, etc.

TEACHING GOOD VALUES AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP 
 
 
Dr. Marian Bock, Director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle’s Virtues Project defines virtues as universal positive character traits. She 
defines values as agreements, rules, principles, codes and beliefs about how to practice these virtues. Bock recommends integrating fifty-two 
universal virtues into appropriate family life classes by encouraging students to recognize them in themselves and others.

THE WAY FORWARD 
 
 
AREAS OF FOCUS  
 
NEW CURRICULUM  
 
Philosophy / Rationale 
(Explains why there is a curriculum.  It 
is the component to be worked on. All 
teams work jointly. Be clear and 
concise.) 
The curriculum will be based a thematic approach with emphasis on life skills and character 
development. It  will address the social issues and risk behaviours of children and adolescents in the 
Bahamian Education system e.g. violence, HIV, AIDS, STIs, child abuse, obesity, teenage 
pregnancy, low self-esteem, and gang culture. Age appropriate topics will be developed for various 
grade levels. 
Goals and Objectives 
(Provides communicative objectives, 
content, suggested activities, assessment 
and resources) 
The curriculum will contain an over-arching goal.  The sub-goals (standards) and objectives 
(benchmarks) will be related to the over-arching goal. 
Scope and Sequence 
Provides an overview of what is to be 
taught and learnt at each level of the 
student’s development 
A Scope of Sequence Chart will be included for grades 1-6, which will be based on the four major 
themes in the CARICOM HFLE Framework: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, Sexuality and 
Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. 
Scope of Work 
Provides communicative objectives, 
content, suggested activities, assessment 
and resources 
The curriculum will progress from components based to a thematic approach and will  incorporate 
the following areas: 
-Issues in schools and society 
-Curriculum connections with Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies, 
-Character development, life skills and values 
-Literacy development e.g. reading/writing activities 
-Technology  
-Gender equality 
Design / Format 
The curriculum will continue to use the landscaped format (81/2 x 11) which is easier to manipulate 
and is reader-friendly. Objectives will be clearly matched with the overarching goal and sub-goal. A 
glossary of terms will be included in the document, as well as a variety of resources for both 
teachers and students. 
The curriculum will be available on the internet with live links. CD and hard copies will also be 
made available.
