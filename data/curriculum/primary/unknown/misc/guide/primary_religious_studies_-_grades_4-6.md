PREFACE 
 
 
 
In the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the predominant religion practised is Christianity.  The Preamble to the Bahamian Constitution indicates that the 
preservation of our nation’s freedom is predicated upon a “national commitment to self-discipline, industry, loyalty, unity and an abiding respect for Christian 
values.” Therefore, the Religious Studies Curriculum, at the elementary level, is based entirely on Judeo-Christian teachings and principles.   
 
Religious Studies is a core subject at the elementary level and must be taught as a separate subject or as a part of the integrative process.  The Curriculum is 
based on four strands:  Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and Celebrations/Festivals.  Through these broad strands, key 
concepts, values, attitudes and skills are integrated from Grade One to Grade Six.   
 
In this revised document, there is a greater emphasis on the development of skills that students will need to live successfully as national and global citizens.  
Furthermore, grade level standards and benchmarks are clearly outlined in order to consistently monitor student progress and performance.  The curriculum is 
rigorous but it is designed for flexibility and to encourage creativity.

RATIONALE 
 
Throughout our ever-changing world, there is a basic longing for human beings to connect with the spiritual side of their existence.  Even very young children 
express a natural curiosity about their existence and purpose. This curiosity leads to a search to find answers to fundamental questions such as:  Why am I here?  
Why do people suffer?  What happens after death?  Religion serves the purpose of connecting human beings with their Creator, enabling them to explore answers 
to some of life’s mysteries.  
 
Religious Studies affords learners opportunities to explore religious beliefs and practices and how they impact individuals and the society.  It enables them to 
consider and respond to fundamental questions about their purpose in life.  It promotes the development of values and morals, enabling students to make informed 
decisions on moral and ethical issues.  Moreover, Religious Studies provides opportunities for students to demonstrate respect for other people, their opinions and 
beliefs. 
The aim of Religious Studies, therefore, is to help students develop skills for lifelong learning, enabling them to become productive citizens and stewards of the 
Earth. The Christian beliefs and values that are esteemed in this society will be transmitted to our students, providing them with a foundation on which they can 
develop good character, strengthen social relationships and build strong communities.  Ultimately, students will be equipped with the necessary skills, values and 
attitudes for life and work in the 21st century. 
 
The Religious Studies Curriculum supports the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (2015-2030) which promote equality for all, protection of our 
natural resources and peaceful societies.

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies could be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.   
 
 
The following example indicates how the curriculum objectives are number:

others in our words and

in 
praying,

1.1. C.4.1. Discover that 
God is omnipresent, 
omniscient and eternal 
 
 
Christians use words such as 
omnipresent, omniscient and 
eternal to describe the nature 
or 
attributes 
of 
God.  
Omnipresent 
means 
that 
God is everywhere. Heaven is 
His dwelling place but His 
presence 
can 
be 
felt 
throughout 
the 
Earth.  
Omniscient means that He is 
all knowing. Man’s thoughts 
and inner secrets are known to 
God.   Eternal means that He 
is unending; He has no 
beginning and no end. 
Concepts:  attributes, 
omnipresent, 
omniscient, eternal 
 
Skills:  using 
vocabulary accurately; 
writing 
 
Attitude:  awe and 
wonder

with columns labelled 
omnipresent, omniscient 
and eternal.  Write definition 
of each word in your own 
words.  Draw a picture to

Truths related to the nature of 
God are found in Scripture.  
Psalm 90:1-2 reveals that God 
is 
eternal 
or 
everlasting. 
Psalm 139:7-8 tells us that 
God 
is 
omnipresent 
or

4.1. B.4.3. Infer why 
Jesus Christ is 
referred to as the 
Light of the World 
 
The world experienced great 
darkness 
(confusion) 
before 
Jesus Christ was born (Isaiah 
9:1-6) but when Christ was born 
he brought light, hope and joy 
(John 12:46).  Jesus was born to 
be the Light of the World so that 
mankind would find their way 
back to God amidst all of the 
turmoil in the world. (John 8:12) 
Jesus is still the Light of hope for 
the world today.

2.2. A.4.1. Explain 
that worship should 
be done reverently 
and sincerely 
Worship expresses a person’s 
reverence for God and it should 
be done sincerely.  According 
to Jesus, some people worship 
God “with their lips” but not with 
their hearts (Matt. 15:8-9).  
Christians must have honest 
and sincere hearts when they 
worship God.  Our hearts 
should be clean and our spirits 
free (Ps. 51:10).

Christians believe that a part of 
their purpose in life is to serve 
others.  To serve means “to give 
assistance or help.”  Jesus 
Christ said if someone wants to 
be great, he/she must be the 
“servant of the rest” (Matt. 
20:26).  When Christians serve, 
they express the love of God 
within them and place the needs 
of others first.

others.  He willingly helped 
those who were sick, physically 
challenged or possessed with 
demons.  He wanted people to 
know that God loved them.  In

an example of how they should 
serve others.

Physical and mental health are 
very important in a person’s life.  
Physical health is how well your 
body is functioning.  Mental 
health refers to the well-being of 
your mind and emotions.  If you 
are physically and mentally well, 
you will be able to cope with 
everyday issues you face.

When 
something 
challenging 
happens like sickness or death of 
a family member, a person may

biblical examples of 
healthy and unhealthy 
family relationships 
 
The Bible gives us examples of 
healthy and unhealthy family 
relationships.  In the story, “The 
Baby who Survived,” we have 
an example of a supportive 
family.  Moses’ family members 
worked together to save his life. 
He grew up with love and 
support. 
 
In the story of “Cain and Abel,” 
we see an example of jealousy 
among brothers that led to 
murder. 
 
Cain’s 
behaviour 
disrupted his family and caused 
evil to spread on the Earth. 
 
From these stories we can see 
that our behaviour affects our

positively

4.1. D.4.1. Examine the 
significance of the 
resurrection for 
Christians 
 
The resurrection of Jesus 
Christ is very significant to the 
Christian faith.  If Jesus was 
not risen from the dead, then 
the believer’s faith is not real 
and he/she is still in sin (1 Cor. 
15:17).  Jesus was victorious 
over 
death; 
therefore, 
all 
believers can have eternal life.

The resurrection gives hope to 
believers that one day they will 
rise from the dead.  The 
physical body that dies will be 
raised as a spiritual body that 
lives forever.  Death will be 
destroyed forever.  Christians 
will go to heaven to be with

The way individuals behave 
will cause them to 
experience good or bad 
consequences.  When we 
follow rules at home, 
school or in the wider 
community, we get rewards 
such as verbal praise and 
treats.  When we disobey 
rules, we are punished and 
privileges are taken away.   
 
In the wider community, if 
people break laws, they 
can pay a fine or even go 
to jail. 
These consequences are 
very serious.

born, an angel told Mary that 
she would give birth to the Son 
of God (Luke 1:31-35).  After 
Jesus was baptized, a voice 
from heaven said, “This is my

Jesus Christ’s coming to Earth 
was very significant.  He was 
the only one who could bring

2.2.A.5.3. Examine 
Biblical examples of 
persons who worshipped 
God reverently and 
sincerely 
In The Bible, there are many 
examples 
of 
persons 
who 
worshipped God reverently and 
sincerely. In the Old Testament, 
Abraham 
was 
a 
sincere 
worshipper who loved God so 
much, that he did not hesitate to 
sacrifice his only son when God 
told him to.  The life of Abraham’s 
son was spared because of his 
obedience. 
 
In 
the 
New 
Testament a woman washed the 
feet of Jesus with her hair, her 
tears and an expensive oil.  She 
was a sincere worshipper who 
spared no expense in honouring 
Jesus.

2.2.B.5.1. Distinguish 
between the various 
types of prayer 
Prayer is important to the Christian faith.  
Three types of prayers are petition, 
intercession and thanksgiving.  A prayer of 
petition is asking God to do something for 
ourselves or for others (Living Prayers, 
2013). Intercessory prayer is a prayer of 
petition for other people. A prayer of 
thanksgiving expresses thanks to God for 
His goodness and blessings without making 
a request of God.

death.  It is sometimes called the Lord’s 
Supper or Eucharist. In some churches, 
foot washing is connected to Holy 
Communion.

2.2.C.5.2. Discover 
the origins of Holy 
Communion 
Holy Communion was first observed by 
Jesus and His disciples at the Passover 
meal. Jesus washed His disciple’s feet 
(John 
13:4-9) 
and 
served 
them 
unleavened bread and wine (Mat. 26:26-
30). 
Jesus 
said 
that 
the 
bread 
represented His body and the wine His 
blood, shed for the forgiveness of sins.  
Holy Communion is served faithfully in 
Christian churches because of Jesus’ 
command (Luke 22:19).

2.2.C.5.3. Describe the 
rituals of infant 
dedication and baptism 
Christening, infant dedication or 
baptism 
is 
another 
common 
Christian ritual.  A ritual is a 
solemn ceremony that follows a 
set format.  During an infant’s 
dedication, the baby, parents and 
godparents are present. These 
individuals stand before a minister 
of God. Then the child is prayed 
for and dedicated to the Lord.  In 
some churches, the baby is 
anointed with water. As an infant 
Jesus was presented to the priest 
Simeon for a blessing (Luke 2: 22-
38).  This was a common Jewish 
practice.

of 
the 
Earth’s 
resources.  This means practising 
the Three R’s: reduce, reuse and 
recycle.  Preservation is the 
protection of an area. We should

It is important to care for our total being: 
our physical, mental, emotional and 
spiritual selves. Our total being is needed 
to effectively perform daily activities. An 
unhealthy body makes it difficult to carry 
out simple tasks. A healthy mind (the part 
of our body that thinks) and spirit (the part

hard 
worker 
“will 
get 
everything 
he 
wants.”  
Proverbs 12:11 states that a 
hard-working farmer “has 
plenty to eat.”  This verse 
also 
suggests 
that 
an 
individual must not waste 
time on “useless projects.”

It is important for human beings 
to reproduce so that the Earth 
can survive.  God told Adam and 
Eve to be “fruitful and multiply 
and 
replenish 
the 
Earth.” 
Through reproduction human

The Bible expresses many 
truths about the benefits of 
having children.  Psalm 127:3 
states that children are a “gift” 
or “blessing” from the Lord.  
A woman rejoices when she 
has children because the 
shame 
is 
gone 
(Psalm 
113:9). Children bring joy to 
the home.  They also help to 
“bring parents closer to God 
and develop their Christian 
character.” 
  
Children, in the Bible days, 
assisted their parents by 
working (Gen. 4:2).  Today, 
children do chores at home 
and later find jobs.

to reflect on Jesus Christ’s 
passion or suffering and death. 
During the week, Christians fast, 
pray and participate in some of 
the special ceremonies of the 
church.  They get to “travel 
through the suffering” before 
celebrating the joy of Easter.

significance of Jesus 
Christ’s resurrection  
  
The 
resurrection 
of 
Jesus 
Christ is very significant to the 
Christian faith.  If Jesus was not 
resurrected then the Christian 
faith would be “a delusion” or 
“vain” and there would be no 
salvation for mankind (1 Cor. 
15:17).  Jesus defeated death 
and obtained eternal life for all 
who believe.

parable is an earthly story with a 
spiritual message or moral.  In the 
parable of the “Prodigal Son,” Jesus 
teaches us about God’s love and 
forgiveness. The 
parable 
also 
teaches 
us

Individuals should seek to 
honour the Holy Spirit in their 
daily lives. We honour the Holy 
Spirit by listening to His voice 
as He teaches and guides us.  
We must follow His instructions 
and be obedient. We must do 
what is pleasing to God so that 
the Holy Spirit can dwell in our 
temples (1 Cor. 3:16).  We 
must produce spiritual fruit 
(Gal. 5:22-23). We must also 
honour the Spirit in worship.

The fruit of the Spirit is seen in 
individuals who are disciples of 
Jesus Christ. Galatians 5: 22-23 
states, “But the Fruit of the Spirit 
is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, 
kindness, goodness, 
faith, gentleness, 
self-control. 
Against 
such,

Christians develop faith, meekness

hearing God’s word and believing, 
nurturing a prayer life and never 
giving up. Meekness comes through 
service and knowing who you are.  
Temperance comes when you keep

Scripture.

the lives of biblical 
characters who 
displayed faith,

The Bible gives us examples of 
individuals who displayed faith, 
meekness and temperance. 
Ruth, the Moabite was an 
example of unwavering faith 
and 
bravery. 
After 
being 
widowed early in life, she 
stayed with her mother-in-law 
and followed God the rest of 
her life. David displayed self-
control when he didn’t kill Saul, 
even 
though 
he 
had 
opportunity to do so. Moses 
was called the meekest man 
on earth.  He was slow in 
speech and thought he would 
not make a good leader.  We 
can certainly learn from their 
examples.

Human beings were created 
with a conscience or inner

This helps us to make moral

areas: 
“God's

Both Harvest and the American

are 
for 
the 
purpose of giving thanks to God 
for 
the 
harvest. 
God 
commanded Israel to celebrate 
harvest festivals to give thanks 
for their crops. The Pilgrims 
started Thanksgiving in America 
in 1621, after a difficult winter 
the previous year, to celebrate a 
bountiful harvest. 
 
Today, in the Christian church 
we celebrate Harvest by giving 
thanks to God for all of His 
blessings. People bring food 
items to share with the needy.  
Bahamians 
also 
celebrate 
Thanksgiving 
with 
family 
gatherings and the eating of 
turkey and ham.

Sometimes our prayers may not be

unforgiving spirit also hinders our prayers 
(Mark

Unbelief 
can 
be 
a

Improper motives prevent prayer being

create pollutants by throwing garbage 
on the Earth and through their work in 
factories. 
“Pollutants 
damage 
the 
quality of air, water, and land.” They can 
bring destruction to all living things.

There are many scriptures related to one’s 
spiritual, mental, physical and emotional 
health. Our bodies are living sacrifices 
(Romans 12:1-2) and our minds need to be

Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:20). Our spirit is 
to be preserved from being fearful so we 
can trust God’s power (2 Timothy 1:7). We

Women in biblical days who were 
unable to reproduce, faced many 
challenges. 
Elizabeth 
was 
an 
example of someone who was 
barren. Because of her barrenness, 
an angel appeared to her husband 
and told him that Elizabeth would 
have a son (Luke 1:5-25). Another 
example was Sarah who faced the 
same contempt from Hagar, her 
maid, who had a child for her

According to the New York

“people 
want 
more 
leisure 
time 
and 
personal 
freedom.” “Not having a partner

Jesus Christ’s suffering and death has 
had tremendous effect on all human

body on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). Because 
of His death all who believe in Him will 
have forgiveness of sins and eternal life 
(John 3:16).  Jesus received many 
stripes so that we could be healed (Is.

Jesus Christ’s resurrection is central

It is important to have respect for the 
laws of God and the laws of society. 
Respecting God’s laws indicates an 
individual’s love, trust and faith in 
God. Society needs laws in order to 
survive. Without laws there will be 
chaos. 
Law-breaking 
sometimes 
leads to the violation of people’s

The Bahamas is rich in traditions that have 
influenced our behaviour. Character building 
is an important part of our training.  We learn 
to have manners and respect for others, from 
our elders. We are taught to be polite to 
strangers and be a good neighbour. 
Going to church is vital because our nation is 
guided by Christian principles. The Bible 
provides principles for daily living. 
 
Bahamians are great story tellers. Stories 
which teach life lessons have been passed 
down from generation to generation. Stories 
about Brer Bouki and Brer Rabbi are famous.
  
Proverbs are sayings that have been passed 
down 
from 
generation 
to 
generation; 
Examples are: “A boaster and liar are first-
cousins” and “Mad dogs bite the hand that 
feed them” (H.H. Finlay – Eleuthera). We use 
proverbs to guide our actions.

The Holy Spirit impacts people’s lives every 
day. The Holy Spirit works in us by replacing 
our sinful characteristics with the Fruit of the 
Spirit (Gal. 6:22). His work makes us more 
and more like Jesus. Acts 1:8 states that the 
Holy Spirit empowers Christians to be 
effective witnesses for Jesus Christ. He 
teaches believers and guides our decisions 
(John 14:26).  He helps us when we do not

According to the article, “The Importance of 
Culture,” culture is “the lifeblood of a vibrant 
society, expressed in the many ways we tell 
our stories, celebrate, remember the past, 
entertain ourselves, and imagine the future.” 
 It is handed down from generation to 
generation. Across time, various groups 
developed their own cultures, or sets of 
beliefs, and behaviours. People of the same 
culture, societies, or communities had a 
sense of belonging together.

the ways in which 
Christian 
celebrations have 
impacted our 
culture 
 
Christian celebrations have impacted our 
culture in many ways. They have impacted 
our behaviour and traditions. Traditions such 
as going to church services, eating special 
foods, enjoying seasonal music, decorating 
our homes and participating in parades are 
all enjoyed.  Christian celebrations have 
helped Bahamians to be more peaceful, 
joyous, generous and respectful of their 
fellow neighbours and visitors to our country.

Focus on topic  
(content)  
There is one clear, well-focused topic. 
Main idea stands out and is supported 
by detailed information.  
Main idea is clear, but the supporting 
information is general.  
Main idea is somewhat clear, but there is a 
need for more supporting information.  
The main idea is not clear. There is a 
seemingly random collection of information.  
Accuracy of facts  
(content)  
All supportive facts are reported 
accurately.  
Almost all supportive facts are reported 
accurately.  
Most supportive facts are reported 
accurately.  
No facts are reported or most are inaccurately 
reported.  
  
Introduction  
(Organization)  
The introduction is inviting, states the 
main topic, and previews the structure 
of the paper.  
The introduction clearly states the main 
topic and previews the structure of the 
paper, but it is not particularly inviting to 
the reader.  
The introduction states the main topic, but 
does not adequately preview the structure 
of the paper nor is it particularly inviting to 
the reader.  
There is no clear introduction of the main 
topic or structure of the paper.  
  
Sequencing   
(Organization)  
Details are placed in a logical order and 
the way they are presented effectively 
keeps the interest of the reader.  
Details are placed in a logical order, but 
the way they are presented sometimes 
makes the writing less interesting.  
Some details are not in a logical or 
expected order, and this distracts the 
reader.  
Many details are not in a logical or expected 
order. There is little sense that the writing is 
organized.  
  
Flow & Rhythm  
(sentence fluency)  
All sentences sound natural and are 
easy-on-the-ear when read aloud. Each 
sentence is clear and has an obvious 
emphasis.  
Almost all sentences sound natural and 
are easy-on-the-ear when read aloud, 
but 1 or 2 are awkward or difficult to 
understand.  
Most sentences sound natural and are 
easy-on-the-ear when read aloud, but 
several are awkward or difficult to 
understand.  
The sentences are difficult to read along 
because they sound awkward, are 
distractingly repetitive, or difficult to 
understand.  
  
Word choice  
Writer uses vivid words and phrases 
that linger or draw pictures in the 
reader’s mind, and the choice and 
placement of the words seems 
accurate, natural, and not forced.  
Writer uses vivid words and phrases 
that linger or draw pictures in the 
reader’s mind, but occasionally the 
words are used inaccurately or seem 
overdone.  
Writer uses words that communicate 
clearly, but the writing lacks variety, punch, 
or flair.  
Writer uses a limited vocabulary, which does 
not communicate strongly or capture the 
reader’s interest. Jargon or clichés may be 
present and detract from the meaning.
