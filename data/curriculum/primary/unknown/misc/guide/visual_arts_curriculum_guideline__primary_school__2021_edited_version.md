Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them with the 
necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an independent, ever-changing world. 
Visual Arts Unit 
Vision 
We envision an art education programme in which all students in The Bahamas are guided toward literacy, an appreciation of Artists, craft persons, and Bahamian 
culture. We also envision an art education programme that is comprehensive and will nurture the spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, creative, imaginative, aesthetic, 
social and physical wellbeing of the child. 
Mission Statement 
Our mission is to advance art education through appropriate curriculum, teacher development programmes, stimulating environments, the provision of materials and 
relevant information. By doing so, we provide students with learning experiences that focus on their creative development, aesthetic appreciation, critical thinking and 
cultural awareness as well as inter-disciplinary integration. 
Belief Statement 
Art education is beneficial to all students regardless of social, ethnic, economic or educational background. Art is an integral part of the overall educational development 
of the student as it compliments and unites other disciplines while promoting visual literacy skills, imaginative thinking and visual communication. 
We further believe that: 
• Art education provides students with the means to think critically, experience, and understand the world around them in unique ways. 
• Art enables students to become self-directed and lifelong learners. 
• Art provides learning opportunities of varying abilities. 
• Art education enhances the ability to interact in society by developing creative problem solving, inquiry, and communication skills, and by providing an avenue 
for self-expression and multiple points of view. 
• Students develop attitudes of appreciation, self-worth, joy in the creation of artworks, and in viewing the works of other students and artists.

• Art is a way to appreciate the beauty and value of the environment and the preservation of our heritage. 
• Art provides opportunities to exhibit in classrooms, schools, art centres and museums, sharing the art curriculum with the community, teachers, students, and 
examiners. 
• Art education increases awareness of career possibilities, promotes entrepreneurial skills and highlights our community’s visual resources. 
• Art education reflects and influences the cultural, social, political and economic aspirations and concerns of our society. 
• Art is a way to appreciate differences and promotes cultural, social and ethnic similarities.

Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a colour 
can be.  Add white to a colour to make it 
light and add black to a colour to make 
it dark. When black is added to a colour 
it creates a SHADE. When white is 
added to a colour you create a TINT. 
White is the lightest value; black is the 
darkest. Value is important to drawing 
and painting, value changes are what 
creates contrast. Contrast helps us 
understand 2-D artworks.

Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough. 
Tactile Texture can be touched and 
seen. Visual Texture is a texture that 
can be seen in a picture rather than felt.

Cave Art 
Cave paintings are paintings on cave 
walls and ceilings. These paintings 
were made in prehistoric times. Most 
cave paintings date from 10,000 to 
20,000 years ago. The oldest is from 
about 32,000 years ago,  
It is not known why these paintings 
were made. Most people think they may 
have had a function for rituals. They 
may also have been a way to 
communicate; to tell other people about 
something. It could also be a form of 
hunting magic, which is meant to 
increase the number of animals. Most 
paintings are in caves that are difficult 
to access.  
 
Today, there are about 350 caves 
known which have paintings in them. 
Many are in France and Spain.  
 
Most often, animals or hunting scenes 
were painted. Sometimes hands are 
there too, there are also more abstract 
patterns.

Henri Matisse 
Henri Matisse, born in 1869, began his 
working life doing administrative tasks 
for a court. As a gift, his mother gave 
him his first art supplies and he fell in 
love with painting. 
He studied art in Paris where he 
painted mostly landscapes and still 
lifes. He was successful at this and the 
state even bought five of his paintings. 
In 1898, he discovered impressionism. 
A friend and fellow painter, John Peter 
Russell introduced him to the work of 
the impressionists including van Gogh 
who was still unknown and Gauguin. 
Matisse’s style changed completely

25 
 
 
 
• Identify the focal 
point in the 
artwork; 
• Compare and 
contrast the works 
of art and describe 
them, using the 
appropriate 
vocabulary. 
 
following this discovery and colour took 
centre stage in his paintings. 
This love of colour evolved into 
Fauvism, in which natural scenes are 
portrayed in unnatural, usually 
extremely bright, colours. 
By the end of his life Matisse was 
thoroughly interested in patterns and 
from this interest came his collages. 
Made from boldly hand-painted paper 
cut into shapes, Matisse’s collages were 
usually large works of simplicity.  
Andy Warhol 
He was a painter and sculptor. 
Warhol was born on August 6th 1928in 
Pennsylvania U.S.A. 
His dad was a construction worker. 
Warhol was sick at age 8 with the liver 
disease during this time his mother 
taught him to draw. 
When he was 14 his dad died from liver 
disease. 
His dad considered him the smartest of 
all the children so he saved money for 
Warhol to attend college. 
After graduating college in 1959 he 
moved to New York to become an artist. 
In 1961 he created the style of Pop Art. 
He is famous for his Campbell’s Soup 
Cans. In one of his paintings, he had 
200 soup cans that he repeated over

it dark. When black is added to a colour 
it creates a SHADE. When white is 
added to a colour you create a TINT. 
White is the lightest value; black is the 
darkest. Value is important to drawing 
and painting, value changes are what 
creates contrast. Contrast helps us 
understand 2-D artworks.  
• Mix the secondary colours then darken each by 
adding black

Pattern, Rhythm & 
Movement 
• Recognize patterns 
around them 
• Describe a pattern 
• Examine how artists 
use patterns as a 
form of expression 
• Experiment with 
lines, shapes and 
colours to produce 
patterns using a 
variety of media 
• Perceive and 
describe rhythm 
and movement in 
works of art and the 
environment. 
• Create a piece of art 
emphasizing rhythm 
and movement, 
using a chosen 
printing method. 
Patterns  
Patterns can be found everywhere in 
our daily lives, on tree leaves and 
trunks, waves, butterfly wings, sea 
shells and lots more. 
These are created by repeating lines, 
shapes and colours. The part 
that is repeated is called a 
motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art through 
repeating lines, shapes, colours, and 
more. Rhythm creates a mood like 
music or dancing. The best example of 
movement in art is Vincent van 
Gogh's The Starry Night, which takes 
your eyes on a rollercoaster ride 
around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears. 
Visual rhythm is created by repeated 
positive shapes separated by negative 
spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your eye 
through the artwork. 
Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements in 
• Patterned hands 
• Pattern landscapes 
• Nature walk for patterns 
• Look at work by the artist Piet Mondrian 
• Line patterns

their artwork using the same size and 
length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples include 
flowers, clouds, or waves. Flowing 
rhythm is when organic shapes are 
repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, but 
we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes in 
a way that would lead the viewer’s eyes 
from one point to the next in their 
paintings, or use certain brush 
techniques to mimic the movement. 
 
Texture 
• Explore how 
patterns can be used 
to create texture 
• Describe the look 
and feel of a variety

Texture  
Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough.

Egyptian Art 
We learn about the Ancient Egyptians 
from their art. From their art, we can 
learn things like what they looked like, 
what kind of clothes they wore, what 
jobs they had, and what was important 
to them. 
The artwork created by the Ancient 
Egyptians had to do with their religion. 
They would fill the walls of the tombs of 
the Pharaohs with paintings and 
sculptures that were there to help the 
Pharaohs in the afterlife. Temples were

another popular place for art. The 
temples often held large statues of their 
gods as well as many paintings on the 
walls.  
The Egyptians are famous for their 
giant sculptures, an example of this is 
the Great Sphinx at Giza.  The Sphinx is 
over 240 feet long.

Space 
Space is determined by where an 
object is situated; It can be created 
using colour, shapes and values. 
Positive  
This is the object being drawn like an 
apple or a car. 
Negative 
This is the space that is left empty. It is

Balance 
The way parts of a picture are 
arranged is called balance. 
Artists use balance in their artwork to 
give equal weight to both sides of their 
designs. 
1. Size. Larger objects have more 
visual weight than smaller 
objects. 
2. Colour. Bright colours are 
visually heavier than dull 
colours. 
Symmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of artwork 
or an object are identical. 
Asymmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of artwork 
or any object are different or not the 
same. In Asymmetrical balance in art, 
each half is different but has equal

Georges Seurat 
“Georges Seurat was born in Paris, 
France on December 2nd 1859. His 
parents were wealthy allowing him to 
focus on his art. He was a quiet and 
intelligent child who kept to himself. 
Georges attended the School of Fine 
Arts in Paris starting in 1878. He also 
had to serve a year in the military. 
Upon his return to Paris, he continued 
to refine his art skills. He spent the next 
two years drawing in black and white. 
With the help of his parents, Georges 
set up his art studio not far from their 
house. Because his parents supported 
him, George was able to paint and 
explore any areas of art he chose. Most 
of the poor artists at the time had to 
sell their paintings to survive. Seurat 
began to explore the science of optics 
and colour. He found that, rather than 
mixing the colours of paint on a palette, 
he could place tiny dots of different 
colours next to each other on the 
canvas and the eye would mix the 
colours. He called this way of painting 
Divisionism. Today we call it 
Pointillism. Seurat felt that this new

way of painting would make the colours 
appear more brilliant to the viewer. 
When Georges was just 31 years old he 
became very sick and died. He likely 
died from meningitis.” 
  Ducksters 
Henri Rousseau 
Henri Rousseau was a French artist 
born in 1844, died in 1910. He was a 
self-taught artist who often painted 
images of jungle scenes and animals. 
His work was almost always bright and 
colourful and he is best known for his 
Sleeping Gypsy painting of 1897. 
Henri Rousseau’s father was a  
tinsmith. He left school at an early age 
and entered military service, where he 
stayed for four years. After his 
marriage in 1869, he became an 
inspector with the Paris toll office. In 
180 he decided to become an artist.

Value 
• Differentiate 
between the 
lightness and 
darkness of colours 
in art and nature. 
• Compare and 
contrast the range of 
hues  
• Produce work with a 
variety of tints and 
shades. 
• Use shading (value) 
to transform a two-
dimensional shape 
into a three-
dimensional form 
(e.g., circle to a 
sphere). 
• Use contrast (light 
and dark) 
expressively in an 
original work of art. 
Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a 
colour can be.  Add white to a colour to 
make it light and add black to a colour 
to make it dark. When black is added 
to a colour it creates a SHADE. When 
white is added to a colour you create a 
TINT. White is the lightest value; black 
is the darkest. Value is important to 
drawing and painting, value changes 
are what creates contrast. Contrast 
helps us understand 2-D artworks.  
• Mix the secondary colours then darken each by 
adding black 
• Make 3 values of each primary colour, light,

motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art through 
repeating lines, shapes, colours, and 
more. Rhythm creates a mood like 
music or dancing. The best example of 
movement in art is Vincent van 
Gogh's The Starry Night, which takes 
your eyes on a rollercoaster ride 
around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears. 
Visual rhythm is created by repeated 
positive shapes separated by negative 
spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your 
eye through the artwork. 
Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements 
in their artwork using the same size 
and length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples 
include flowers, clouds, or waves.

Flowing rhythm is when organic 
shapes are repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, but 
we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes in 
a way that would lead the viewer’s 
eyes from one point to the next in their 
paintings, or use certain brush 
techniques to mimic the movement.

Texture  
Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough.

Greek Art 
“Ancient Greeks lived over 3000 years 
ago. Alexander the Great was the 
founder of the Ancient Greek Empire, 
which stretched into Europe, Egypt, 
and South-West Asia. 
The Greeks had some strange 
superstitions about food – some 
wouldn’t eat beans as they thought 
they contained the souls of the dead!  
Did you know that the Ancient Greeks 
invented the theatre? They loved 
watching plays, and most cities had a 
theatre – some big enough to hold 
15,000 people! Only men and 
boys were allowed to be actors, and

they wore masks, which showed the 
audience whether their character was 
happy or sad. Some of the masks had 
two sides, so the actor could turn them 
around to change the mood for each 
scene. 
 Most Ancient Greeks wore a chiton, 
which was a long T-shirt made from 
one large piece of cotton. The poor 
slaves, however, had to make do with 
a loincloth (a small strip of cloth 
wrapped around the waist)!” National 
Geographic Kids 
The Greeks believed in a large family 
of gods who were very much like 
humans; they did not worship animal 
gods. Each god ruled over a different 
part of human life. Zeus was 
recognized as the father of gods and 
humans, Nike was the goddess of 
Victory, Poseidon was God of the Sea, 
Demeter was the Greek goddess of 
agriculture and protected the trees, 
plants and grains. 
Hades was the brother of Zeus and 
Poseidon and the god of the 
Underworld. There were many Greek 
Gods.  
“The Greeks loved art and poetry and 
greatly admired skill in athletics. The 
city-states of Greece competed with 
each other not only in trade but in

games originated in Greece in 766 BC.” 
Craft Whack 
“Periods of Greek Art Archaic Period: 
The Greeks from the Archaic Period 
made sculptures of men called Kouroi 
and women called Korai. These statues 
had similar features and stood stiffly 
with their arms at their sides. Classical 
Period: During the Classical Period, 
Greek artists began to sculpt people in 
more relaxed postures and even in 
action scenes. The most famous works 
from this era include the statue of Zeus 
at Olympia and the statue of Athena at 
Parthenos. 
Hellenistic Period: After Alexander the 
Great conquered much of Asia, the 
sculpture and artwork of the Greeks 
became influenced by the cultures and 
people they had conquered. This 
period is called the Hellenistic Period. 
This period saw new subjects 
including women, children, and 
common people appear in Greek art. 
Famous works from this era include 
the Venus de Milo, the Dying Gaul, and 
the Winged Victory of Samothrace.”

Space 
Space is determined by where an 
object is situated; It can be created 
using colour, shapes and values. 
Positive  
This is the object being drawn like an 
apple or a car. 
Negative 
This is the space that is left empty. It is 
the space around and between objects. 
Horizon Line 
The horizon line is the horizontal line 
that separates the earth from the sky 
or the sky from the sea. 
Vanishing Point 
The point where parallel lines meet. 
Background 
The part of the picture that is furthest 
away from you. The objects here are 
very small and the colours are very 
dull. 
Middle Ground 
This is between the Background and 
foreground. 
Foreground 
This is the part of the picture that is 
closest to you or lower down on the

Balance 
The way parts of a picture are 
arranged is called balance. 
Artists use balance in their artwork to 
give equal weight to both sides of their 
designs. 
Size. Larger objects have more visual 
weight than smaller objects. 
Colour. Bright colours are visually 
heavier than dull colours. 
Symmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of an 
artwork or an object are identical. 
Asymmetrical Balance 
This means that both sides of artwork 
or any object are different or not the 
same. In Asymmetrical balance in art, 
each half is different but has equal 
visual weight. The artwork is still 
balanced even though each side is 
different.

for the “drip” technique he used to 
create his major paintings. Rather 
than using a brush, he poured or 
dripped paint onto canvases. The 
result was abstract paintings. They 
expressed emotions rather than 
presenting a recognizable image. 
Early Life 
Paul Jackson Pollock was born on 
January 28, 1912, in Cody, Wyoming. 
He grew up in Arizona and California. 
In 1928 he enrolled in art high school 
in Los Angeles, California. Pollock met 
a teacher there who trained him in 
drawing and painting and introduced 
him to trends of European modern art. 
In 1930 Pollock moved to New York 
City to study art. It was at this time 
that he dropped Paul as his first name 
and began using Jackson. Pollock 
enrolled at the Art Students League, 
where he studied for over two years. In 
1935 Pollock received a job painting 
through the New Deal, a government 
program created to help end the Great 
Depression. 
Art Career 
Pollock received a contract with a 
famous art gallery in 1943. His first 
one-man show was held that year. His 
painting continued to evolve during 
the next few years. Pollock married

Lee Krasner, also a painter, in 1945. 
He continued to have one-man shows 
of his paintings nearly every year into 
the early 1950s. 
The Drip Technique 
Pollock first used the process of 
pouring or dripping paint onto a flat 
canvas in 1947. These drips and pours 
formed complex patterns that 
expressed his feelings and personality. 
Pollock’s style is also known as action 
painting. 
Death and Legacy 
Pollock died in an automobile accident 
on August 11, 1956. His work had an 
enormous influence on the art world 
during and after his life. Artists that 
came after Pollock looked to him as 
the model of a painter who 
successfully combined art and life.”

Georgia O’Keeffe  
Born in 1887, Georgia O'Keeffe was an 
American artist who painted nature in 
a way that showed how it made her 
feel. She is best known for her 
paintings of flowers and desert 
landscapes. 
She played an important part in the 
development of modern art in 
America, becoming the first female 
painter to gain respect in New York's 


57 
 
 
 
art world in the 1920s. Her unique and 
new way of painting nature, 
simplifying its shapes and forms 
meant that she was called a pioneer. 
As well as the shapes of the landscape 
itself, O'Keeffe was fascinated by the 
bones and skulls she found in the 
desert landscapes near where she 
lived.  
Georgia knew from the age of 12 that 
she wanted to be an artist. She went to 
art school but what she was taught 
there didn’t seem relevant to the way 
she wanted to paint. Georgia met other 
artists who, like her, were experimenting 
with abstract art. Art in the 1920s was 
exciting. Artists didn’t just want to 
show how something looked but were 
using colours, shapes and brush-
marks in unexpected ways to express 
meanings, ideas and feelings. This 
encouraged Georgia to develop her 
unique style – a combination of 
abstract and realistic.” Tate Kids

Outline 
 An outline is the line or group of lines 
that define a shape or figure. 
Contour Lines 
Contour lines describe the shape of an 
object and include interior detail. 
Gesture Lines 
Gesture lines are drawn quickly and 
are used to lay in the structure of a 
form. It describes movement and 
direction.  
When an artist wants to show 
distance and depth he or she uses a 
technique called Linear Perspective. 
For example, in a picture of a road, 
the artist would use parallel lines 
that seem to meet or come close 
together in the distance.

Colour Schemes 
A colour scheme is the choice of 
colours used in various arts and 
designs.  
Artists use colours very carefully in 
their artwork. Artists may use the 
colour wheel to plan a colour scheme. 
For example primary colours or 
complementary colours. Artists 
choose colours that portray their 
moods or feelings.

Value 
• Produce work with a 
variety of tints and 
shades. 
• Use shading (value) 
to transform a two-
dimensional shape 
into a three-
dimensional form 
(e.g., circle to a 
sphere). 
• Use contrast (light 
and dark) 
expressively in an 
original work of art. 
• Experiment with 
creating varying 
degrees of colour 
intensity 
• Use various colours 
to show how 
Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a 
colour can be.  Add white to a colour 
to make it light and add black to a 
colour to make it dark. When black is 
added to a colour it creates a SHADE. 
When white is added to a colour you 
create a TINT. White is the lightest 
value; black is the darkest. Value is 
important to drawing and painting, 
value changes are what creates 
contrast. Contrast helps us 
understand 2-D artworks.  
Shading, Shadows and Highlights 
Shading is adding light and dark 
values to a drawing. To get darker 
values with a pencil you press harder, 
to get lighter values with a pencil you 
press softer. Black is the darkest 
value and white is the lightest value.

changes in light can 
create differences in 
shading 
There are three basic shading 
techniques, hatching, cross-hatching 
and stippling. 
Shadows are created when an object 
comes between the light and the 
surface. Shadows are always opposite 
the light. A highlight is an area where 
the light hits the object directly. 
Highlights are the lightest value. 
Pattern, Rhythm & 
Movement 
• Recognize patterns 
around them 
• Describe a pattern 
• Examine how artists 
use patterns as a 
form of expression 
• Experiment with 
lines, shapes and 
colours to produce 
patterns using a 
variety of media 
• Perceive and 
describe rhythm and 
movement in works 
of art and the 
environment. 
• Create a piece of art 
emphasizing rhythm 
and movement, 
Patterns  
Patterns can be found everywhere in 
our daily lives, on tree leaves and 
trunks, waves, butterfly wings, 
seashells and lots more. 
These are created by repeating lines, 
shapes and colours. The part 
that is repeated is called a 
motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art 
through repeating lines, shapes, 
colours, and more. Rhythm creates a 
mood like music or dancing. The best 
example of movement in art is Vincent 
van Gogh’s The Starry Night, which 
takes your eyes on a rollercoaster 
ride around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears.

cultures 
Visual rhythm is 66created by 
repeated positive shapes separated 
by negative spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your 
eye through the artwork. 
Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements 
in their artwork using the same size 
and length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples 
include flowers, clouds, or waves. 
Flowing rhythm is when organic 
shapes are repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, 
but we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes 
in a way that would lead the viewer’s 
eyes from one point to the next in

Texture  
Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough. 
Artists create texture in their artwork 
to show how objects might feel 
Tactile Texture can be touched and 
seen.  
Visual Texture is a texture that can be 
seen in a picture rather than felt.

The Renaissance  
The Renaissance was a cultural 
movement that began in Italy in the 
1300s. The Renaissance increased 
trade between European countries 
which led to increased wealth and 
power.  This increased wealth allowed 
merchants and businessmen to 
support artists. Scholars, 
philosophers, and artists turned to 
the works of the ancient Greeks and 
Romans for inspiration.  
During the Renaissance books were 
invented, Galileo experimented with 
astronomy, Christopher Columbus 
discovered the new world and Martin 
Luther broke away from the Catholic 
church to form the Lutheran. 
Renaissance artists made their 
paintings look realistic, they 
experimented with perspective. 
Artists now began to focus on 
paintings of humans and not Gods or 
biblical themes. Four famous 
Renaissance artists were Leonardo, 
Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello. 
Leonardo da Vinci 
“Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 
May 1519) was an Italian man who 
lived in the time of the Renaissance.

He is famous for his paintings, but he 
was also 
a scientist, mathematician, engineer, i

t, botanist, musician, and writer. 
Leonardo wanted to know everything 
about nature. He wanted to know how 
everything worked. He was very good 
at studying, designing and making all 
sorts of interesting things.”KPedia 
Michelangelo Buonarroti 
“Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti 
Simoni (6 March 1475 – 18 February 
1564), known as Michelangelo, was 
an Italian Renaissance painter, sculpt
or, architect, poet, and engineer. 
Along with Leonardo da Vinci, he is 
often called a "Renaissance man" 
which means that he had great talent 
in many areas.” KPedia

• Identify that the 
shapes of objects 
change when the 
viewpoint changes 
• Record observations 
of natural, man-
made objects as well 
as the human face.  
 
Observational study 
Observational art is to draw or paint 
a subject as accurately as possible. 
The subject may be a still life, figure 
model, portrait or landscape and the 
image must be created from real life 
rather than a photograph or the 
artist's imagination. 
Draw what you see and not what you 
know. 
Natural and Man-Made Objects 
Fruits and vegetables, flowers, 
seashells, shoes, teapots, soda cans. 
Portrait drawing 
A portrait is a drawing of the face 
only with a neck and shoulders. it can 
be a human face or an animal face. 
Facial features 
facial features are the distinguishing 
elements of the face, there are 8 and 
they include the face, eyes, nose, ears, 
mouth, teeth, chin and hair. 
Facial Proportions 
The eyes are halfway down the head. 
The edges of the nostrils line up with 
the tear ducts of the eyes. 
The space between the eyes is 
approximately the width of an eye. 
The head is about five eyes wide.

Marc Chagall 
Chagall was born in Russia. He was 
the oldest of 9 children of a poor 
Jewish family. His father was a 
Herring fish merchant and his mom 
kept a shop in the front room. He 
painted at a very young age and went 
to art school for free because of his 
talent. Because he was poor he would 
paint on old curtains or shirts. 
Edvard Munch 
“Edvard Munch was born on the 12th 
of December 1863. Munch, a 
Norwegian, had four brothers and 
sisters. He had followed his mother 
and sister by being the best artists in 
their family. While Munch was still 
young, his parents, a brother and 
Munch's favourite sister died. This 
probably explains the bleakness and 
pessimism of much of Munch's work. 
It was when he was thirteen that he 
came to like art. The first paintings 
Munch did were simple objects like 
medicine bottles and other objects. 
Later on, he drew oil paintings. 
He went to a technical college in 1879 
where he learnt how to draw

Lines 
• Recognize that 
various kinds of 
lines enable an 
artist to express 
ideas. 
• Distinguish between 
an outline, a contour 
and a gesture

Outline 
 An outline is the line or group of lines 
that define a shape or figure. 
Contour Lines 
Contour lines describe the shape of an 
object and include interior detail. 
Gesture Lines 
Gesture lines are drawn quickly and 
are used to lay in the structure of a 
form. It describes movement and 
direction.  
When an artist wants to show distance 
and depth he or she uses a technique 
called Linear Perspective. For example, 
in a picture of a road, the artist would 
use parallel lines that seem to meet or 
come close together in the distance.

Abstract Art 
Abstract art is not about realism, it’s 
about shapes, colours and feelings.  
Abstract art shows what an artist feels 
and thinks, and not what he or she 
sees. An abstract artist uses colours 
and shapes to express his or her 
emotions and ideas.

Colour 
Artists use colours very carefully in 
their artwork. Artists may use the 
colour wheel to plan a colour scheme. 
For example primary colours or 
complementary colours. Artists choose 
colours that portray their moods or 
feelings.

Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a 
colour can be.  Add white to a colour to 
make it light and add black to a colour 
to make it dark. When black is added 
to a colour it creates a SHADE. When 
white is added to a colour you create a

TINT. White is the lightest value; black 
is the darkest. Value is important to 
drawing and painting, value changes 
are what creates contrast. Contrast 
helps us understand 2-D artworks.  
Shading, Shadows and Highlights 
Shading is adding light and dark 
values to a drawing. To get darker 
values with a pencil you press harder, 
to get lighter values with a pencil you 
press softer. Black is the darkest value 
and white is the lightest value. 
There are three basic shading 
techniques, hatching, cross-hatching 
and stippling. 
Shadows are created when an object 
comes between the light and the 
surface the object sits on. Shadows are 
always opposite the light. A highlight 
is an area where the light hits the 
object directly. Highlights are the 
lightest value. 
Monochromatic  
A monochromatic piece of art shows 
one colour with black or white added 
to it. Mono means one.

emphasizing rhythm 
and movement, 
Patterns  
Patterns can be found everywhere in 
our daily lives, on tree leaves and 
trunks, waves, butterfly wings, 
seashells and lots more. 
These are created by repeating lines, 
shapes and colours. The part 
that is repeated is called a 
motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art through 
repeating lines, shapes, colours, and 
more. Rhythm creates a mood like 
music or dancing. The best example of 
movement in art is Vincent van 
Gogh’s The Starry Night, which takes 
your eyes on a rollercoaster ride 
around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears. 
Visual rhythm is 81created by 
repeated positive shapes separated by 
negative spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your 
eye through the artwork.

Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements 
in their artwork using the same size 
and length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples 
include flowers, clouds, or waves. 
Flowing rhythm is when organic 
shapes are repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, but 
we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes in 
a way that would lead the viewer’s 
eyes from one point to the next in their 
paintings, or use certain brush 
techniques to mimic the movement.

The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough. 
Artists create texture in their artwork 
to show how objects might feel 
Tactile Texture can be touched and 
seen.

shape, and colour 
are repeated in 
works of art;

Mannerism 
“Mannerism is a style of art that was 
created in the 
Late Renaissance period, from about 
1520 until about 1600. The Mannerist 
style of painting or sculpture often 
shows figures that are "elongated" 
(made longer) and "distorted" (made 
into strange shapes"). The aim of the 
Mannerist artist was usually to make 
art that looked "elegant". The 
Mannerist style began in Italy, where 
the artists were influenced by the 
figures that Michelangelo painted on 
the ceiling and in the "Last Judgement" 
in the Sistine Chapel. During the 
Renaissance, artists like Leonardo da 
Vinci and Raphael had tried very hard 
to learn from nature and to paint 
things in a very realistic way. These 
two famous painters both died around 
1520. Many artists then decided that 
they were going to use the art of 
painting to "express themselves". They 
were not going to follow the rules 
of anatomy and perspective in the way 
that Leonardo and Raphael did. 
Mannerist paintings are often full of 
figures that seem to be twisting, 
writhing or fighting. The faces of the 
figures often show strong emotions

Kpedia 
El Greco – “The Greek” 
“Paintings by El Greco are known for 
their brilliant colours and strong 
contrasts of light and shadow. El Greco 
also stretched out the figures in his 
paintings. Their bodies and limbs are 
unusually long, thin, and muscular. 
Although El Greco was Greek, he lived 
much of his life in Spain, where he 
became the first great master of 
Spanish painting. 
El Greco was born in 1541 in Candia 
(now Iráklion), on Crete, an island 
south of Greece. His original name was 
Doménikos Theotokópoulos. Not much 
is known about his early life. In the 
1560s he travelled to Italy, where he 
studied the painting style of Italian 
artists of the period. While in Italy he 
acquired the nickname El Greco, which 
means “The Greek.” 
El Greco left Italy for Spain in the late 
1570s. He settled in Toledo, Spain, 
which was then a religious and 
cultural centre. He created many 
religious paintings for the city’s 
Roman Catholic churches and 
monasteries as well as for private 
clients. The Burial of the Count of 
Orgaz, completed in 1588, is 


86 
 
 
 
considered his masterpiece. It shows 
saints in heaven watching the funeral 
of an important man. El Greco also 
painted several portraits. 
El Greco died in Toledo on April 7, 
1614. He remains one of the world’s 
most admired painters.” Britannica

 Frida Kahlo grew up in a house called 
La Casa Azul with her parents and six 
sisters. That house is now the Frida 
Kahlo museum.  As a child, Frida loved 
to draw. At age 6, she caught a disease 
called polio which damaged her right 
leg. 
Initially studying medicine, Kahlo 
changed her career path following a 
serious accident. As part of her 
recovery, Kahlo underwent thirty-five 
operations but she kept painting. Her 
mother had a special easel made for 
her so she could paint in bed, and her 
father lent her his box of oil paints and 
some brushes.  
Frida often painted portraits of 
herself. She wanted to show people 
about her suffering, her inability to 
have children, and also the people in 
her life. She created one hundred and 
forty-three paintings, and of these, 
fifty-five are self-portraits.” Sofia

his nearsightedness, Auguste 
struggled in school but seemed to find 
contentment while drawing. Largely 
self-taught up to the age of 13, he 
began his formal schooling at the age 
of 14 at Ecole Imperiale Speciale de 
Dessin et de Mathematiques, where he 
studied painting and drawing. For the 
next four years, he learned the basic 
skills of an artist.” Making Art Fun
