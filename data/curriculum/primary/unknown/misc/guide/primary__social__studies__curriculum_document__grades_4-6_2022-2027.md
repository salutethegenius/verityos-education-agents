PREFACE 
The Primary Social Studies Curriculum Guidelines reflect the 10 strands and the standards of the National Council of Social Studies.  The curriculum is 
designed to meet the needs of a diverse student population and lends itself to differentiated instruction.  Hence, the Primary Social Studies Curriculum is 
designed to ensure that students are equipped with the necessary knowledge, attitudes and skills that are required for the 21st century.  These skills are referred 
to as the ‘four Cs’.  They are the skills of ‘critical thinking’, ‘communication’, ‘collaboration’ and ‘creativity’.   
Social Studies is inclusive of different areas of study, ranging from History and Geography to Civics and Economics, among others as comprised in this 
document.  It is important that students at the varying grade levels are exposed to the various aspects of Social Studies in order to provide the essential 
prerequisites necessary for effective spiraling of content and skills. 
The appendix comprises of culturally relevant suggestions for integration and the interconnections of content and topics, ring plays, Bahamian songs, teacher- 
created jingles, suggested virtual assessment tools, apps, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Preamble of the Constitution of the 
Commonwealth of The Bahamas, a rubric for assessing students’ projects, suggested field experiences and websites as well the various maps to use to ensure 
that the teaching of geography is strategic.  
The Primary Social Studies and Tourism Education for The Bahamas, levels one through six, and the School Atlas for the Commonwealth of The Bahamas are 
the required texts for the teaching of Primary Social Studies.  These texts were written by Bahamian educators in conjunction with Hodder Education, (formerly 
Pearson) and are designed with and inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning with suggested activities and strategies to engage the learner.  The 
document allows for additional resources to be used to supplement the instructional programme in order to remain culturally relevant and current in an ever-
changing society and world. 
It is believed that this document will facilitate in the content being relevant, engaging, meaningful and enduring as the experiences are grounded on the national 
standards of Social Studies.

SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief 
systems, such as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and 
beliefs? What does language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, 
sociology and anthropology, as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one 
to develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? 
How has the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme 
typically appears in courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things 
located? Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have 
for people? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to 
adulthood? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are 
maintained or changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by 
institutions? How do institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses 
dealing with sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science and history.  
 
 
Power, Authority  
Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is 
power? What form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, 


11 | P a g e  
structured, maintained and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically 
appears in units and courses dealing with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of 
the factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic 
concepts and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is 
new technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which 
is unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people 
benefit from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural 
and physical sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, 
civics and government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme 
typically appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and 
the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. 
Students confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the 
balance between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world 
community? How can I make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, 
cultural anthropology and fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

All independent nations display 
their countries independence 
through their flag, national 
anthem and coat of arms.  In 
1973, The Bahamas became an 
independent nation.  Timothy 
Gibson composed the national 
anthem of our country. It begins 
by asking us to hold our heads 
high as a Bahamian people.  We 
are reminded of our place in the 
world as an independent nation.  
Our national anthem encourages 
us to set goals and move steadily 
toward them.  It explains that we 
can only excel as a nation through 
love, unity and recognizing our 
God.   
 After reciting the pledge 
discuss what it means to you 
 
 Create a classroom pledge

the national pledge of The 
Bahamas. The national pledge of 
The Bahamas identifies us as a 
people, Bahamians, it entreats us 
to be loyal and live by the ideals 
of our nation.  Although divided 
by waters, the pledge also

The Eleutheran Adventurers, after 
they landed in The Bahamas, 
named the island the landed on, 
Eleuthera, and settled there. Life 
on the island was not easy so the 
group began to trade wood for 
supplies, as farming was not an 
option.  Eventually, Captain Sayle 
left Eleuthera and moved to an 
island he called Sayle Island which 
was later renamed Providence.  
We now call this island New 
Providence.  These people began 
the practice of trading and 
salvaging things from wrecked 
ships. As more people came to the 
island, the Eleutheran Adventurers 
established settlements both on   
Eleuthera and New Providence 
islands.

The Bahamas. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plantation is a large area of land 
where crops are grown. 
By the 1780s, the United States 
was no longer an English colony. 
The Loyalists were a group of men 
who wanted to continue to be loyal 
to the king of England. Therefore, 
they left, the now independent 
America and travelled to The 
Bahamas that was still a British 
colony at that time. 
The Loyalists established cotton 
plantations on the family islands.  
These plantations comprised of a 
house, large fields and slaves.  
Large amounts of cotton were 
exported to America and in the off 
seasons, slaves were made to rake 
salt from the pans. 
 
 Construct a model of a loyalist 
plantation. 
 
 Reenact a day in the life of 
various people of that time e.g. 
master, field slave, house 
slave, mistress of the 
household etc.

owners, some Loyalists were 
fishermen.  Many of these settled 
in Abaco and Eleuthera. 
Most Loyalists were Anglicans.  
They built Christ Church 
Cathedral and St. Matthew’s 
Anglican Church.  They started 
schools in our islands. John Wells 
set up a newspaper.

From the 16th to 19th 
centuries Africans were shipped to 
the New World as part of 
the Atlantic slave trade. Ships 
departed Europe for African 
markets with manufactured goods, 
which were traded for purchased 
or kidnapped Africans, who were 
transported across the Atlantic as 
slaves. The slaves were then sold 
or traded for raw materials, which 
would be transported back to 
Europe to complete the voyage. 
Slaves in The Bahamas came via 
different routes. Some came direct 
from Africa enduring the middle 
passage. The middle passage was a 
perilous part of the voyage. Some 
slaves also came with the Loyalists 
from America.

There are four intermediate points. 
They are north -west, north- east, 
south-west and south -east.   
Scale models and drawings are

compared with what it represents.    
Lines of latitude and longitude 
help us to locate places on a map. 
The islands of The Bahamas are 
located between latitude 20°N and 
latitude 28°N and longitude 72°W

In the 1950s tourism became a 
business. Sir Stafford Sands, the 
Father of Tourism, was in charge 
of the Development Board. He 
aimed to increase visitor arrival 
and make tourism a year round 
business. He encouraged hotels to 
install air-conditioning.  Gambling 
was legalized and casinos were 
built in Nassau, New Providence 
and in Freeport, Grand Bahama.

The Bahamas’ revenue is obtained 
from tourism and many citizens 
are employed in this sector. 
There are many different kinds of

1. Review Bahamian names and 
their origins. 
 
2. Identify surnames with islands. 
 
The history of the people who 
came to The Bahamas plays an 
important part in defining who we 
are as a people. It is this heritage 
that enables us to trace the origin 
of many of our names back to 
slavery or Loyalists times. 
Certain islands tend to have 
particular family names based on 
how the island was settled by the 
people who went there. One can 
often tell which island a person is 
from based on their surname.  
It takes a long time and many 
people to build a nation. Nation 
builders ensure that our country 
thrives and is strong. These people 
lead in many different fields and 
make significant contributions. 
 
 Make a map showing the 
possible movement around the 
islands by the various settlers 
based on the names associated

the Christian calendar because it is 
determined by the date of Easter.  
It gets its English name from 
'Whitsun' or 'Whit Sunday'. 
 
On Randol Fawkes Labour Day, 
Bahamians take time to reflect on 
the efforts made by thousands of 
people in the 20th century to help 
bring equality and better labour 
standards to the country. Workers 
march through the streets to show 
worker solidarity and to draw 
attention to the current struggles of 
workers. The day also recognizes 
the efforts of men like Randol 
Fawkes the ‘father’ of the labour 
movement in The Bahamas.

3. Summarize the role Woodes 
Rogers played in eradicating 
the pirates from The Bahamas. 
In the 17th century (1600s), many 
buccaneers lived in the Caribbean.  
 
They were a mixed group of 
English, French and Dutch men 
and women who were 
shipwrecked and marooned off the 
coast of Hispaniola.  
 
They hunted wild boar and cattle 
and learned how to cure meat 
from the Carib people. The meat 
was cured over a boucan near a 
slow burning fire. The sailors sold 
the meat to passing ships and 
therefore, they were called 
buccaneers.  
 
Later Spaniards chased the 
buccaneers off Hispaniola and 
they took to the sea and became 
pirates.

2. Discuss the impact of 
wrecking upon communities in 
New Providence and the 
Family Islands. 
Wrecking is attracting ships to 
cays and reefs, and then taking 
away the goods on board to sell. 
 
Wrecking was a big business in 
The Bahamas in the mid-1600s. 
 
Many ships were caught in the 
tricky currents around these 
islands and they were swept ashore 
or into reefs.  
 
Sometimes wreckers deliberately 
attracted ships onto cays and reefs 
by false lights.  
 
Once the ship was wrecked, the 
goods were taken away and sold.   
 
Many people made a living from 
wrecking.

Lincoln declared a blockade on the 
ports of the southern states 
(Confederacy).  
 
These states were more plantation 
states with few industries.

export their cotton produce to 
Europe to trade for guns and 
ammunition which they could not 
manufacture, but needed in order 
to fight the northern states.

came to restore their health. The 
first hotel, the Royal Victoria 
Hotel was built in 1861 and this 
resulted in an increase of visitor 
arrivals. 
 
In 1900, the Colonial Hotel was 
built and the Miami - Nassau 
Winter Steamship service began.  
 
This resulted in rich and famous 
visitors.

Tourists at this time stayed in

Revenue from customs duty on 
liquor during the bootlegging 
period was used to improve 
infrastructure: deepening the 
harbor, providing running water 
and electricity in order to make 
tourists comfortable.  
 
The ordinary Bahamians, however, 
did not have these luxuries.  They 
still used outside toilets and tin 
tubs, and well manual hand pumps 
and wells.

staff training, courtesy campaigns 
and the planning of new tourism 
programmes in hotels. Tourism is 
the number one industry in The 
Bahamas. Most of The Bahamas’

Sponging 
The sea offers a lot of resources 
from which income can be made.  
 
A Frenchman named Gustave 
Renouard introduced sponging to 
The Bahamas.  
 
In the 1800s sponges were sold to 
Greek merchants who in turn sold 
them to other merchants who 
cleaned, clipped, dyed sorted and 
pressed them into bales to be 
exported.  
 
In 1938, a strange fungus attacked 
the sponge bed.  After the disease, 
synthetic sponges were made so 
there was little market demand for 
the natural ones.

Today, sponging is now done on a

larger. 
 
Process of sponging: 
1. Hook sponges 
2. Soak in a Kraal (shallow 
water closure) 
3. Beaten 
4. Scraped 
 
During the hurricane season, 
fishermen are unable to go to sea 
and salt production can be 
hindered by heavy rains, therefore 
some revenue is lost.

Product. 
 
Straw is the main material 
harvested and prepared to make 
today’s straw hats and bags.   
 
Straw bags produced by Harl 
Taylor, a former local designer 
and manufacturer, have been sold 
for as high as three hundred 
dollars.  Straw is harvested, dried 
and stripped and plated into 
fanners (rolls). After products are 
made, some straw works are 
shellac to increase the longevity of 
the straw. 
 
Sisal is a large leafed plant used to 
produce fiber found in rope. After

Domestic tourists in The Bahamas 
travel by air or sea to the Family 
Islands. Most of the travelling 
occurs during holidays and 
regatta/homecomings. 
 
An international tourist is a person 
who travels outside their county to 
another country.  This usually 
requires travel documents such as 
passports and/or visas. They travel 
by airlines and cruise ships. Those 
who travel by air from far 
distances usually stay longer and 
spend more money than those who 
travel by cruise ships.

3. Analyze how the Contract 
impacted the lives of 
Bahamians 
During the second World War 
(1939-1945) many Americans 
went to Europe to join the troop.  
It was a difficult time for farms 
and factories in the United States, 
as farms and factories lacked the 
workers to be productive.  The 
result was called ‘The Contract’ 
or ‘The Project’.  This was the 
arrangement between the 
governments of the United States 
and The Bahamas to trade 
workers. 
 
Bahamian men and women left 
their homes and families to travel 
and work on the farms and in 
factories in the United States.  
Bahamian workers would send the 
money they earned home to their 
families.

Prior to 1942, labour pays varied 
according to sex and race.  
Unskilled workers, at that time, 
earned four shilling or 31 cents for 
men and 2 shilling or sixteen cents 
for women.   
 
In 1942, The Bahamas Federation 
of Labour was established to 
represent general workers in The 
Bahamas. 
 
The Bay Street merchants 
controlled the payment of labour at 
that time.   
 
American workers were paid more 
than Bahamian workers who were 
doing the same job.   
Although, the American company 
was willing to adjust to equal pay, 
the Bay Street merchants forced 
the American company to 
conform.

5. Explain how global warming 
affects the weather. 
Global warming is the warming up 
of the earth’s atmosphere. The 
main cause of global warming is 
the greenhouse effect.   
Gases such as oxygen, carbon 
dioxide, nitrogen and hydrogen are 
trapped in the atmosphere.  The 
sun shines and heats these gases to 
form a blanket of warmth and light 
which is essential to earth.  But 
power stations, factories and 
vehicles are making new forms of 
gases.   
These new gases are attracting 
more and more of the sun’s heat 
warming the earth excessively.  
This warming is melting our ice 
caps which will result in increased 
sea levels.

History tells us of what has 
happened in the past. A long 
period in the past. A time line is an 
outline of dates and stories of 
history.  
The Lucayans (Arawaks) were the 
native inhabitants of the Bahama 
Islands before the land fall of 
Christopher Columbus on the 
island of San Salvador 
(Guanahani) in 1492.    
During the 1400 Europe which is 
considered the world, had no idea 
new lands existed west of the 
continent.  Many schools of 
thought caused the discovery of 
the new world. 
1. The world was flat and 
heading west would mean 
falling off the end of the 
world. 
 Research if any aspects of 
the Lucayan life that may 
exist in out islands today. 
 
 Draw and color the old and 
new world drawing the 
route Columbus would take

method to grow crops for sale in 
Nassau.   
On many islands, a packing house

Goats are often killed to ensure

steamed mutton and grits remain a

and the fact that we have a 
Governor General, speaks to our 
British culture.

Public Buildings like the Princess 
Margaret Hospital (PMH) and 
historical sites like the Queen’s 
Staircase are all evidence of the 
value we place on our British 
roots.  
Although it is documented that 
many British residence may have 
returned to Britain, many Loyalists 
and other British did not return.   
Making some of our ancestors 
linked to British roots. Bahamian 
surnames can be attributed to the 
slave owners that once occupied 
these islands.  
It was the practice here in The 
Bahamas that slaves took on the 
names of their owners.

ASSESSMENT 
 
There are many national 
celebrations in our country that 
still hold true to their origins.  
They continue to display the purest 
elements of our culture.  Junkanoo, 
which has its roots in our slavery, 
is celebrated nationally twice a 
year, Boxing Day and New Year’s 
Day.    
This celebration combines the 
elements of dance, music and 
costumes creating a cultural 
experience found nowhere else in 
the world.   
Over years the years, the changes 
in costumes, music and dance has 
enhanced the festival.   
But the Junkanoo, even after 
modernization, remains a strong or 
maybe even a stronger celebration 
of culture today.

aspect of your countries culture.  
We use location, population, 
government, festivals, resources 
and history to compare countries 
around the world to our country. 
Countries compared are Japan, 
Australia, Brazil, Switzerland and 
Africa.  Located in different 
regions around the world, there are 
many differences but there are also 
amazing similarities. 
Africa lies to the east of the 
Bahama Islands on the other side 
of the Atlantic Ocean. Africa 
extends nearly twelve million 
square miles. It is a continent 
made up of many nations.

Africa offers an array of rivers 
deserts, lakes, mountains, 
grasslands and forests.  
Today’s Bahamian descends from 
the Kongo Kingdom which lay 
south of the Kongo River. This 
tribe shares a common 
understanding with the Bahamian 
culture.  Both cultures share 
understanding that people should 
relate to one another.  Both 
cultures insist that children should 
respect and yield to elders, and 
strangers should be treated with 
unwavering hospitality. 
 East of the continent Africa is the 
continent, island, country of 
Australia. Although in different 
hemispheres, the same line of 
latitude that runs through The 
Bahamas also runs through the 
northern part of Australia.

The life style of the Aborigines 
people of Australia resembles that 
of the Lucayans that lived in The 
Bahamas long ago. 
West of Africa is the continent of 
South America. Covering half of 
that continent is the country of 
Brazil. Brazil is known for its 
cultivation of Coffee, rainforest 
and carnival. The carnival 
celebrations seem to mimic our 
Junkanoo, as groups compete for 
prizes. Costumes, dancers and set 
the theme for the parade are 
participants take to the streets late 
at night until early the next 
morning.  
Moving North west off South 
America in the Pacific Ocean lay 
the islands of Japan.  Like The 
Bahamas, this country is made up 
of many islands.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas.MaryIngraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 
 


xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirationsand feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

During the 70s the game declined, 
Because teachers did not know the game. 
They taught track and field and other sports, 
Which buried the cricket name.
