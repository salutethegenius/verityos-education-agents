PREFACE 
 
We live in a world that is scientifically and technologically oriented – a world of phenomenal scientific advancement and innovations. As The Bahamas 
keeps pace with this advancement, our children must be exposed to effective, comprehensive Science Education early in life. We must take advantage of their 
innate curiosity and zeal for learning about the environment before it diminishes. 
 
Science is important because it links to technology and industry, which are areas of priority for a country’s development. Science provides ways of 
making sense of the world systemically. Opportunities must be provided for our children to experience science at an early age. It is important for them 
to understand scientific ways of thinking and to have adequate knowledge of science if they are to keep pace with the technological advances and 
innovations of the 21st Century. 
 
The production of the revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines consisted of local educators who accepted the challenge of producing this document 
– a third document for the Department of Education: Science Unit (August 2001, June 2010, and December 2021). The Production Team has ensured that 
the purposes of developing sciences are met. A few of these aims are to communicate, to relate science to everyday life, and to explore, apply and 
investigate scientific and technological knowledge and ideas. 
 
In accomplishing these aims, instructional facilitators will guide students through the use of various communication modes, developing their awareness of 
the importance of science in life. Students will be encouraged to make decisions based on their knowledge of science and issues such as personal health and 
well-being, safety and the preservation of the environment. These students will be able to appreciate that experimentation is not judged by success or failure, 
but by the knowledge, which is gained from the process. 
 
The revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines grades 1-6 boasts several new features. The previous Primary Curriculum consisted of three stands; we 
introduced a fourth strand –  “Environmental Science.” More focus was given to the integration of technological skills in developing the basic concepts, skills 
and activities in the Life, Earth, Physical and Environmental Sciences. Also noteworthy in the document are the deliberate efforts to highlight skills and 
attitudes that we wish for our students to develop. 
 
When the guidelines in this revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines are effectively implemented, they will ensure that our students have the 
foundation of basic scientific concepts and principles that develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge necessary for them to successfully work and live 
in the 21st Century.

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

1. Identify traits 
of amphibians. 
 
Amphibians are vertebrates 
with smooth moist skin. 
 
Amphibians lay eggs in 
water where their young 
hatch and remain until they 
are adults. 
 
Young amphibians do not 
look like their parents. As 
they grow their bodies 
change. For example, 
tadpoles live in water and 
look very different from 
adult frogs who live on land. 
 
Young amphibians breathe 
through their gills while 
living in the water. As they 
develop into adults, they 
grow lungs to breathe. 
 
Amphibians can also breathe 
through their skin.

2. Investigate 
how insects use 
camouflage and 
mimicry in their 
environment. 
 
Animals have special 
features called adaptations 
that allow them to live 
where they do. 
 
An animal adaptation is a 
body part, a body covering 
or an action (behaviour) 
that helps the animal to 
survive  in its environment. 
 
Camouflage and mimicry 
are animal adaptations. 
Many small animals use 
these adaptations to avoid 
being eaten by other 
animals. 
 
Mimicry is an adaption in 
which an animal looks and 
sounds like another animal. 
For example, some 
harmless animals look and 
behave like poisonous 
animals that are distasteful 
to predators who avoid 
eating them.

1. Adapting to Survive 
Set up a display of animals 
(toys/figures). Have students 
volunteer to choose an animal 
from the display. Each student 
will be asked a question related 
to an adaptation the animal 
has. 
E.g. Why does the giraffe have 
a long neck? Draw conclusions 
and discuss. 
2. Blending In 
a. Design and draw a new kind 
of insect. 
b. Look around your classroom 
for different colours, shapes,

could blend with and not be 
seen easily. 
c. Then, cut out your drawing. 
d. Predict where your insect 
will be hardest to find. Put 
your insect in that place. See if 
others can find it.

Respiratory 
System. 
2. Investigate 
the main parts 
of the 
Respiratory 
System and 
discuss how air 
is transported 
throughout the 
human body. 
 
The respiratory system is 
a group of organs that 
transports air into the body. 
 
When we breathe, air 
moves through the nose or 
mouth and goes down the 
windpipe, also known as 
the trachea. 
 
The trachea divides into 
two tubes called the 
bronchial tubes. The 
bronchial tubes carry air 
into our lungs. 
 
The human body has two 
lungs. In the lungs the 
bronchial tubes divide into 
smaller tubes. 
 
Tiny air sacs called alveoli 
are found at the end of the 
smallest tubes.

 
When air enters the lungs, 
it fills the air sacs. Oxygen 
moves from the air sacs 
into the lungs. 
 
At the same time, carbon 
dioxide moves from the 
blood to the air sacs. When 
you breathe out, carbon 
dioxide leaves the body. 
 
The diaphragm is a dome- 
shaped muscle used in 
breathing. It is at the 
bottom of the lungs. 
 
The diaphragm flattens or 
tightens (contracts) when 
we breathe air in (inhale). 
This action pulls air into 
the lungs. 
 
To breathe out or exhale, 
the diaphragm goes back to 
its normal shape and 
pushes air out of your 
lungs.

 
Germination is defined as 
the beginning of growth. 
The term is most commonly 
associated with plants, 
describing the process of a 
seed sprouting into a 
seedling. The term 
germination can also be 
applied to spores or buds. 
 
When seeds are dry and 
hard, they are dormant. 
 
When a seed is moistened, 
it will absorb water, 
breaking the seed coat and 
initiating the food supply in 
the cotyledon. 
 
Temperatures must fall 
between a specific range for 
seeds to germinate. 
 
Sunlight supports the 
germination process as it 
provides warmth to the soil.

1. Describe the 
components of air. 
 Air is a mixture of gases 
that surrounds Earth. The 
blanket of air that 
surrounds Earth is called 
the atmosphere. 
 The air we breathe is 
made up mostly of 
nitrogen and oxygen. It 
consists of 78% 
nitrogen  and 21% 
oxygen. 
 Oxygen is a very 
important part of the air 
because humans and 
animals need it to survive. 
 Smaller amounts of other 
gases found in the air are 
carbon dioxide (0.4%), 
water vapor (0.6%} and 
traces of other gases like 
ozone, helium and 
hydrogen.

composition of air. Write the 
names of the four main gases 
that make up air on different 
colour chart paper. Assemble 
them in no particular order. Have 
volunteers place them in order 
from greatest to least on the 
board. Afterwards, volunteers 
can come up and write the 
percentage underneath the type 
of gas as a bonus. Discuss how 
carbon dioxide and water vapor 
make up even less than 1% of 
air, compared to nitrogen and 
oxygen.

wetlands. 
Mangroves are ecosystems found 
along the coast and in wetlands. They 
live in brackish and salt water. The 
four common types of mangroves 
found locally are red mangroves, 
black mangroves, white mangroves 
and buttonwood. Each type of 
mangrove has a special role play in 
the ecosystem. 
Red Mangroves grow in water along 
the shoreline. They have thick prop 
roots that trap debris and mud. They 
help to prevent waves from flowing 
too far inland, which reduces flooding 
in coastal communities and further 
inland. 
Black Mangroves grow in shallower 
salty water. They are surrounded by 
thin breathing roots.

Mangroves 
White mangroves usually live in 
brackish water. They have thick, 
knobby breathing roots. 
Buttonwoods live near the sea on 
rocks and beaches. They have no prop 
or breathing roots. 
 
Wetlands provide nutrients and serve 
as nurseries for young marine life and 
species such and white land crabs 
Mass land clearing, cutting down of 
hills, filling in of mangroves and 
digging canals and marinas are 
threats to mangroves and wetland 
ecosystems. 
Mangroves are important natural

Indigenous or native plants are 
plants that grow naturally in an area 
(they were not brought in by 
anyone). The Bahamas has over 
1400 native plants. The Levy 
Native on Eleuthera has 400 
different native Bahamian plants. 
To learn about the plant found 
there,  you may visit their website at 
www.levypreserve.org. Common 
native plants in The Bahamas 
include: 
 Pigeon Plum—produces fruits 
that supports bird and iguana 
species. 
Poison Wood—popularly known 
for causing severe skin irritations; 
however, its fruits are a vital part 
of the diet of many birds such as 
the White Crown Pigeon and the 
Bahama Parrot.

Explain at least 
two threats to 
native plants. 
Identify ways in 
which native 
plant may be 
conserved. 
 There are several threats to 
native plants. These include: 
 
 Habitat Loss: the removal of 
plants for farms development 
and housing. 
 Overexploitation: when  too 
many trees are removed or 
when they are harvested in an 
unsustainable manner. 
 Invasive Species: alien or non-
native species that  are brought 
from other country. They grow 
faster and outcompete the 
native plants. 
 Air pollution: pollutants in the 
air impact the growth and 
variety of plants. 
 Climate Change: studies 
suggest most plants will have 
difficulty adapting to the rise in 
temperature and extreme 
drought that we will experience 
as a result of our changing 
climate.

plants face (e.g. Last week 
Jimmy’s dad commented that the 
native plants that once grew on 
the beautiful beach opposite their 
home were slowly being 
replaced by thousands of 
casaurina trees). 
Flyer 
Have students design a flyer for 
a public meeting on threats to 
native plants. Remind them that 
the flyer should be exciting to 
make people want to attend. It 
should also highlight how the 
threats are a problem and why 
it is important for people to 
come  out and participate.

3. Classify 3 
groups of 
mollusks. 
There are 3 types/groups of 
mollusks: 
 
No shell/cephalopods: 
These  mollusks have no shell 
covering the outside of its body 
(e.g. slug, octopus, squid) 
 One shell/gastropods: 
These mollusks have one shell. 
The shell has a “trapdoor” 
covering the opening. The 
animal can pull its head back 
into the opening and the trap 
door closes.  In this way, the 
animal is protected from 
enemies. The queen conch is an 
example of a mollusk that is 
used in many Bahamian dishes. 
Other examples of mollusks 
include, snails, curds, whelks. 
 Two shells/bivalves:  
These mollusks have a double 
shell that is hinged. They get 
their food by filtering it from 
the water. Tube like parts are 
used for feeding (e.g. oyster, 
clam, mussel, scallops).

We take care of our skeletal system 
by exercising, resting, eating healthy

Calcium is a mineral that helps 
bones grow strong and healthy. Dairy 
products like milk, cheese and yogurt 
contain calcium. Dark green 
vegetables like spinach, broccoli and 
collard greens also contain calcium. 
Exercise makes bones healthy. 
Sitting up straight with good posture

1. Explain how 
eating disorders 
affect health. 
2. Infer how 
proper nutrition 
is related to 
good health. 
 Nutrition is providing the 
body with chemicals 
called nutrients that the 
body needs to stay 
healthy and to carry out 
its functions (do work). 
 Nutrients are materials 
the body uses for making 
new tissue, protecting our 
systems and giving us 
energy. 
 There are many different 
nutrients that the body 
needs. Proteins, 
vitamins, minerals, fibre 
and carbohydrates are 
nutrients. 
A nutritional deficiency is 
the lack of a certain nutrient 
in the diet. These 
deficiencies can cause the 
blood to carry less oxygen 
than the body needs or can 
cause anaemia, which is a 
lack of iron. 
 Engage in 
collaborative 
activities 
 Make inferences 
and draw 
conclusions 
 Make predictions 
 Cooperation 
 Thinking

4. Explain the 
importance of a 
balanced diet. 
 To get the correct amount of 
nutrients, we need to eat a 
wide variety of foods. 
 Foods are divided into groups 
according to the nutrients they 
contain. 
 The main food groups are: 
1. fats/oils; 
2. meats, fish & alternative; 
3. milk, cheese and diary; 
4. fruits & vegetables; 
5. bread and cereal. 
 All the foods we eat make up 
our diet. 
 A balanced diet includes all 
the nutrients the body needs 
to function. To eat a balanced 
diet, we should eat foods 
from each of the food groups 
every  day.

Obesity: 
If you take in more food than your 
body needs, the body stores it as 
fat. Being overweight can damage 
your health. Overweight or obese 
people can develop high blood 
pressure, heart disease and Type 2 
diabetes 
Water: 
Your body also needs water. You 
should drink 6 to 8 glasses of water 
a day. 
Water helps to: 
 
transport nutrients to the 
cells; 
 
build new cells; 
 
keep body temperature

sedimentary rock. Scientists 
called paleontologists 
study fossils. Wood, bones, 
teeth and shells are 
preserved or saved by being 
buried. As the sediments 
harden, the remains become 
trapped in rock and form 
fossils. 
 
Some fossils show 
changes dead animals made 
in their surroundings. These 
are called trace fossils. 
Tracks, burrows, droppings 
and worm holes are some 
examples of trace fossils. 
They tell how an animal

A mold is an imprint made by 
the outside of a dead plant or 
animal. A mould forms  when 
water washes animal or plant 
remains out of rocks. 
Sometimes sediments or 
minerals fill a mould and form 
a  cast. Whole plants or 
animals can become fossilized. 
These can be trapped by sap 
from trees, glacier ice or tar 
pits. When fossils are 
discovered, they are excavated 
or dug out and studied.

A planet’s orbit is the oval-shaped path  the 
planet travels around the sun. 
All planets are in motion. They revolve  or 
move in orbits around the sun. The 
movement of a planet along its orbit around 
the sun is called revolution. A planet’s 
year is the time it takes that planet to 
complete one orbit or one revolution 
around the sun. It takes planet Earth 365 
1/4 days to revolve around the sun. The 
seasons are a result of revolution. 
Planets rotate or spin like a top. An axis  is a 
straight line that runs through an object. The 
turning or spinning of a planet on its axis is 
rotation. The time it  takes a planet to rotate 
once on its axis is a planet’s day. The time 
of rotation differs from planet to planet, so 
the length of a day also differs. Night and 
day are the result of rotation.

The Sun 
The sun is in the center of the solar system. It is a 
star. It is 93 million miles away from the Earth.  
Stars are the only bodies that give off radiant 
energy.  It is a ball of burning gases and molten 
material. The sun is the only star in the solar system 
but there are millions of stars in the universe. We 
can only see a small portion of them with our naked 
eyes. Some stars seem to shine brighter than others. 
This is because they are closer to the Earth or 
because they give off more radiant energy.  
The sun provides heat and light to all of the 
planets. There would be no life on Earth if the sun 
stopped giving off radiant energy. Energy from the 
sun warms the Earth and allows green plants to turn 
raw materials into food (photosynthesis). 
Gravity on the sun is very strong. This is because of 
its great size. The entire solar      system can fit 
inside the sun. Gravity is the force of one object’s 
pull on another. The sun’s    gravity helps hold all 
the objects in the solar system in place or in orbit.

People who study the stars 
are called Astronomers.  
 
Astronomers classify stars by 
their surface temperatures, 
colour and brightness. There 
are several  well-known stars 
that can be seen in the night 
sky. Some are arranged in 
the shape of animals and 
objects. A group of stars 
such as these is called a 
constellation. Some

Another space object is the 
comet. Comets are made 
up of rocks, frozen water, 
frozen gas and dust. When 
a comet gets close to the 
sun you will be able to see 
a long glowing tail or 
coma. This coma consists 
of particles ejected from the

The substance that melts is called 
the solute and the substance that 
does the dissolving is called the 
solvent. When water is added to 
sugar, a solution is made. The 
sugar dissolves into smaller 
crystals then mixed in but does 
not combine with the water 
particles. 
In this solution, the sugar is the 
solute and the water is the 
solvent. Liquid solutions are 
always transparent, or clear. They

Work is done when the position 
of an object is changed either by 
using a pushing, lifting, pulling, 
dragging or dropping force. The 
object may be at rest or in motion 
when a force is applied to it. The 
force that is used to affect an 
object is produced when energy is 
used. 
There are many different forms of 
energy. Heat, light, chemical, 
sound and electrical energy are 
some forms of energy. Each 
form of energy can exist as 
energy in motion or energy at rest 
(stored energy).

chain and a wheel around which the 
rope fits. When you pull down on 
one rope end, the wheel turns and 
the other rope end moves up. 
A pulley that stays in one place is

or rod. A doorknob is part of a 
wheel and axle. The large, round 
knob turns the smaller axle. The 
axle is what pulls in the latch to 
open the door. Without the large 
knob, it would be difficult to turn 
the axle. The small effort force 
you use to turn the knob becomes 
a large resulting force put out by 
the axle.

The Spiny Lobsters, better known as 
crawfish in The Bahamas, is one in a 
family of over 45 species of achelate 
crustaceans. They reproduce in the 
clean, clear tropical waters of the 
Bahamas from August 1st through 
March 31st. Lobsters live in crevices of 
rocks and coral reefs where they hide 
during the day. At night, they forage for 
snails, clams, crabs, and sea urchins. 
Lobsters are known to migrate in masses 
across the sea floor. Up to 50 lobsters 
migrate in one line. They use their 
antennae to stay together. Potential 
predators may be deterred because of 
the loud screech made as the antennae 
(whip) of one lobster rubs against a 
smooth part of the exoskeleton of 
another. 
 
When disturbed, they can swim 
backwards rapidly using the powerful 
strokes of their tails. Lobsters navigate 
by using the smell and taste of natural 
substances in the water.

Fisheries are an essential resource. About 
75% of the world’s fish catch is for 
human consumption. The demand for 
seafood has been rising globally due to 
increased awareness of seafood’s healthy 
properties. Many medicines contain 
compounds derived from marine 
organisms. The ocean provides goods, 
services, employment to millions of 
people around the world  (e.g. 
snorkeling, diving and sports fishing). 
The principal commercial fisheries in 
The Bahamas are crawfish, conch, 
shallow water scale fish like Nassau 
Grouper, jack, snappers and grunts and 
deep-water scale fish like red snapper. 
Fisheries are threatened by habitat loss, 
overfishing, pollution, introduction of 
invasive species and climate change.

In addition to the large amounts of

ocean pollution have been driving the 
world’s wild coral populations to the 
brink of extinction. 
With 75 percent of reefs under the 
threat of damage or death, there often 
seem like there is not much that 
anyone can do to save coral. However, 
scientists in different parts of the 
world, including in The Bahamas, are 
experimenting with growing corals. 
Many projects have been successful. 
They start with a live piece of coral 
which is cut into many smaller pieces. 
Those coral fragments are either glued 
onto round cement platforms roughly 
the size of drink coasters or tied to a 
PVC frame and allowed to hang in the

1. Explain the effects 
of pollution on 
marine resources. 
 
2. Suggest ways to 
prevent ocean 
pollution. 
3. Define the term 
marine debris. 
 
Oceans are polluted by human 
and natural means. People dump 
waste material into the ocean. 
Marine debris is waste that litters 
the ocean. Often such waste 
consists of non- biodegradable 
substances like plastics. Marine 
life eat the plastic which blocks 
their digestive tracts and causes 
starvation. Animals may also get 
trapped in marine debris and 
suffocate. 
 
 
Oil spills are another source of 
pollution. 
 
 
Chemical products such as 
fertilizers and detergents contain 
phosphorus. Phosphorus causes 
algae to grow very quickly and 
smother coral reefs. 
 
 
Scientists are working to 
develop new  kinds of plastics 
that are biodegradable and not 
harmful to marine life. 
However, ocean pollution  can 
be reduced in the following 
ways:

As a result, a huge oil spill has 
occurred on the Little Bahama 
Bank which threatens 
immense damage to 10 
national parks in the area. The 
spill will also greatly affect 
tourism, our main industry in 
the Bahamas, because reefs 
and  beaches will no longer be 
usable. Have them research to 
see what other countries have 
done in similar circumstances. 
Then, simulate a clean-up and

the problem.

The nucleus controls the activities 
of the cell. It is also known as the 
control and the brain of the cell. 
The cell membrane holds the parts 
of the cell together. It also separates 
the cell from its surroundings and 
controls what material enters and 
leaves the cell. The cell membrane 
lets, food, oxygen, and water flow 
into the cell when they are needed, 
and it lets the cells waste flow out. 
Cytoplasm is a colourless, jellylike 
substance containing many 
chemicals to keep the cell 
functioning. The vacuole stores 
food, waste and water. The cell 
wall (only found in plants) is a stiff 
outer layer that protects the cell and 
gives it shape.  
Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll 
that plants need  to make food. 
Without chlorophyll, the plant will 
die and would not be able to make 
its own food.

 Sponges are marine animals. 
Sponges are invertebrates. 
They usually remain anchored

Sponges are filter feeders. 
They filter tiny particles of 
food from the water. 
 A sponge has only two layers 
of cells. The outer covering of 
the sponge’s body is covered 
with tiny holes called pores. 
These pores lead to canals 
which are made up of 
specialized cells with whip-
like  structures that beat 
rapidly. This motion helps 
pump purified water into 
canals. Thread like 
structures remove the tiny 
pieces of food from the water. 
The water then  flows out 
through an opening called a 
vent. Sponges have needle-like 
parts that give them shape.

 Sponges reproduce by budding, where they 
grow a new sponge on them. Once the new 
sponfe grows big enough, it falls off.  
 
 Some sponges reproduce sexually,  forming 
egg and sperm cells. A fertilized egg forms 
a larva that leaves the  parent sponge and 
travels through the water to another part of 
the ocean floor. There, it attaches itself to a 
hard surface where it develops into an adult 
sponge. 
 Different species of sponges have different 
colours, shapes and sizes. Sponges are 
found on reefs in The Bahamas. At one 
time, Bahamian fishermen harvested 
sponges, which were sold to foreign 
countries where  sponges were processed 
into a variety of household items that could 
be used for decorations and bathing. The 
sponging industry was started by the 
Greeks. At that time, the sponging industry 
was the most important economic activity 
in The Bahamas.

 
The part of the tooth that can be seen 
which is not covered by the gum (the 
pink, fleshy part) is called the crown. 
The crown of each tooth is  covered with 
enamel. Enamel is a very  tough 
substance that is hard and shiny and 
protects the tooth. Beneath the enamel is 
dentin, which is the final protective layer 
before reaching the pulp. The pulp cavity 
is where the nerves and blood vessels are 
located. 
 Since teeth are such important tools, 
humans get two sets. Our first teeth start 
to grow when we are just 6 months old. 
They are called primary teeth (milk 
teeth). These are the teeth that falls out

 By the time you turn 12 or 13 years old, all 
your primary teeth will have fallen out. The 
second set of teeth that replace the primary 
teeth is called permanent teeth. 
 Adult humans have 32 permanent teeth, 
which are 12 more than the first set of 
primary teeth. If an adult loses a permanent 
tooth, it will not grow back. 
Types of teeth 
• Incisors are shaped like tiny chisels with 
flat ends that are somewhat sharp. These 
teeth are used for cutting and chopping food. 
 The pointy teeth beside your incisors are 
called canine teeth. There are four of them: 
two  on top and two on the bottom. Because 
these teeth are pointy and sharp, they help 
tear food. 
 Next to your canine teeth are your 
premolars, which are also called bicuspid 
teeth. You have eight premolars in all: four 
on top and four on the bottom. Premolars are 
bigger and stronger, and have ridges, which 
make

• If you open your mouth wide, 
you'll see your molars. You have 
eight of these: four on top and four 
on the bottom. Molars are the 
toughest of the bunch. They are 
even wider and stronger than 
premolars, and they have more 
ridges. Molars work closely with 
your tongue to help you swallow 
food. The tongue sweeps chewed- 
up food to the back of your mouth, 
where the molars grind it until it's 
mashed up and ready to be 
swallowed. 
• The last teeth a person gets are 
wisdom teeth. These are also 
called third molars. They are all 
the way in the back of the mouth, 
one in each corner.

Caring for your teeth:  
- Brush and floss your teeth 
regularly.  
- Use fluoride toothpaste. Eat 
a healthy diet. 
- Visit your dentist regularly 
for dental cleanings and 
check-ups  
- Do not smoke. 
- Avoid eating sugary foods. 
Sugar can hurt your teeth, 
causing tooth decay and 
cavities. 
- Brush your teeth to avoid 
bad breath, gum disease 
(gingivitis), and tooth 
infection and loss of teeth. 
If you do not brush your teeth, 
bacteria will develop, 
clumping together to form a 
sticky substance called dental 
plaque. Antibacterial mouth 
rinses also can help reduce 
bacteria.

1. Define the terms 
 Most of the plants that we are familiar 
with are flowering plants. Another name 
for flowering plants is angiosperms. 
 All flowering plants produce seeds. The 
seeds are produced by flowers. Flowers 
are an adaptation that is important to the 
success of angiosperms. The main parts 
of a flower are the sepals, the petals, the 
pistil and the stamens. 
 The sepals are the green leaves that 
protect the flower while it is in the bud. 
Petals are the colourful parts that 
surround and protect the male and 
female parts of the flower. The pistil is 
the female part of the flower, and the 
stamen are the male part of the flower. 
The female part of the flower produces 
the fruit and seeds, and the male part 
produces pollen. 
 Flowers help to ensure that pollen from 
the male part of the flower gets to the 
female part of the flower. This process 
is called pollination. 
 Make predictions 
 Curiosity 
 Cooperation 
 Questioning 
and posing

 Pollination is the first important 
step in seed formation. A pollinator 
is an organism that transfers pollen 
from the male part of the flower to 
the female. 
 Seeds have very tiny plants inside 
them (seedlings). These grow into 
new plants and ensure that the 
group continues to survive. 
 
 The fruit protects the seeds and 
provides them with food and 
minerals to produce a protective 
coat called the seed coat. 
 When seeds are mature, the fruit 
ripens. Animals eat the fruit and 
scatter the seeds. This allows the 
seeds to grow into new plants in 
different places. The changes that 
occur from the time a seed grows 
into a new plant until that plant 
produces seeds make up the life 
cycle of a plant.

 Plants make their own food 
by a process called 
photosynthesis. During this 
process, plants use light 
energy to change water and 
carbon dioxide into sugar. 
Sunlight is taken in or 
absorbed by chlorophyll in 
the leaves and other green 
parts of a plant.  
 
 Chlorophyll is a chemical 
found in special structures in 
plant cells called 
chloroplasts. Water 
transports chloroplasts  from 
the roots to the leaves and 
stems, and carbon dioxide 
enters the plant through tiny 
openings in the  leaves 
called stomata. The food 
made is called 
sugar/glucose. Oxygen is

 Oil wells are drilled into the rocks to reach 
the oil. A lot of oil is also under the oceans. 
Oil rigs that float are used to get this oil. 
After the oil is pumped, it is sent to 
refineries. At the refineries, it is separated 
into different kinds of  fuels. Most of the oil 
is made into gasoline. 
 Oil is also used to make products such as 
plastics, paints, medicines and soap. Burning 
fuels made from oil can pollute the 
environment. 
 Natural gas is a gaseous fossil fuel 
consisting mainly of methane. Before it is a 
fuel, it must undergo extensive processes to 
have almost all other materials removed from 
it except methane. 
 Compressed natural gas is a substitute for 
gasoline. It environmentally “clean” and it is 
safer than other motor fuels in the event of an 
oil spill. Natural gas is lighter than air, so it 
disperses quickly. Natural gas is also cheaper 
and is being used more in vehicles.

 
Earthquakes cause rapid 
changes on earth. An 
earthquake is a vibration or 
shaking of Earth’s crust. Most 
earthquakes occur along faults. 
A fault is a break in the crust 
along which rock moves. Rocks 
on either side of a fault can 
move up and down, side to side, 
or both. Earthquakes are 
measured on a Richter Scale, 
which uses numbers from 1-9. 
 
A volcano is a mountain that 
forms when red-hot melted rock 
flows through a crack onto the 
earth’s surface. Melted rock 
inside Earth is called magma. 
Melted rock that reaches 
Earth’s surface is called lava. 
The lava and gases that erupt 
from volcanoes are very hot and 
often destroy everything in their 
path. Volcanic eruptions also 
form new crust on continents.

Examples of these are the 
chemical changes that cause 
food to spoil or iron to rust. 
 
Naturally occurring chemical 
changes can be harmful. To 
avoid the effect of naturally 
occurring chemical changes, 
we can resort to freezing or 
drying to preserve food. Tools 
can be kept well-oiled to 
prevent rusting. 
 
 
Rusting takes place when 
chemicals react with oxygen. 
Substances that prevent 
corrosion (rusting) are called 
antioxidants.

 Explain how 
climate change 
affects natural

sea-level rise. 
Gases like nitrogen and oxygen which 
make up 99% of the gas in the 
atmosphere do not absorb heat from 
the sun. They allow it to reflect back 
into space from the Earth's surface. 
Other gases such as carbon dioxide, 
methane and nitrous oxide which 
make up roughly 0.1% of the 
atmosphere absorb heat. When those 
gases absorb solar energy, they 
radiate it back towards the planet's 
surface and to other gas molecules, 
creating the greenhouse effect. This is 
why they are called greenhouse gases. 
The greenhouse effect plays an 
important role in naturally regulating 
the temperature of our climate. 
Without it the Earth's average 
temperature would -64.4 F. That's 
roughly the temperature inside a 
“deep freeze” in your home. 
The term climate change is used to 
describe a long-term change in global 
temperatures and weather patterns.

The earth's temperature has changed 
drastically in its 4.5-billion- 
year history. During the Ice Age 
(which was nearly 300 million years 
long), ice covered vast portions of the 
planet. Today, climate change is 
commonly used as a term to describe 
the effects of global warming that have 
occurred as a result of human 
activity following the industrial 
revolution in the 18th century. 
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 
are  increasing because of human 
activities  like burning fossil 
fuels, deforestation and modern 
farming practices. 
Scientists predict that if temperatures 
continue to rise, we will experience 
more extreme weather conditions, sea- 
level rise, the destruction of coastal 
ecosystems, loss of vital species and 
crops, population displacement and a 
huge cost to the global economy.

Jane Goodall 
As a young girl, Jane Goodall 
dreamed of working with wild 
animals. When she was 26, 
Goodall was offered the 
chance to study chimpanzees 
in Tanzania, Africa. She spent 
the next 25 years researching 
the apes in their natural 
habitat. She made important 
discoveries about the animals’ 
lives such as how they raise 
their young and use tools. 
Goodall saw that chimpanzees 
and their homes were under 
threat. The same thing was 
happening to other animals all 
over the world. So, Goodall 
created a program called Roots 
& Shoots. It encourages kids 
to create community projects 
to protect the planet.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method 
❖ 
Cooperative Learning Technique

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
 Provide guidance for the students. 


 
  
 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps: 
 
PROBLEM   
HYPOTHESIS 
PREDICTIONS 
TEST OF PREDICTIONS 
EVALUATION OF HYPOTHESIS

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere. 


332 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and

An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

I. “OWL STRATEGY” 
Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic.

VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.
