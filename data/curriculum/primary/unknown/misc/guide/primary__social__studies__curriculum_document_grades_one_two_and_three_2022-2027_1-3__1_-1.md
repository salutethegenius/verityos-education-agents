PREFACE 
The Primary Social Studies Curriculum Guidelines reflect the 10 strands and the standards of the National Council of Social Studies.  The curriculum is designed to 
meet the needs of a diverse student population and lends itself to differentiated instruction.  Hence, the Primary Social Studies Curriculum is designed to ensure that 
students are equipped with the necessary knowledge, attitudes and skills that are required for the 21st century.  These skills are referred to as the ‘four Cs’.  They are 
the skills of ‘critical thinking’, ‘communication’, ‘collaboration’ and ‘creativity’.   
Social Studies is inclusive of different areas of study, ranging from History and Geography to Civics and Economics, among others as comprised in this document.  It 
is important that students at the varying grade levels are exposed to the various aspects of Social Studies in order to provide the essential prerequisites necessary for 
effective spiraling of content and skills. 
The appendix comprises of culturally relevant suggestions for integration and the interconnections of content and topics, ring plays, Bahamian songs, teacher- created 
jingles, suggested virtual assessment tools, apps, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Preamble of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of The 
Bahamas, a rubric for assessing students’ projects, suggested field experiences and websites as well the various maps to use to ensure that the teaching of geography is 
strategic.  
The Primary Social Studies and Tourism Education for The Bahamas, levels one through six, and the School Atlas for the Commonwealth of The Bahamas are the 
required texts for the teaching of Primary Social Studies.  These texts were written by Bahamian educators in conjunction with Hodder Education, (formerly Pearson) 
and are designed with and inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning with suggested activities and strategies to engage the learner.  The document allows for 
additional resources to be used to supplement the instructional programme in order to remain culturally relevant and current in an ever-changing society and world. 
It is believed that this document will facilitate in the content being relevant, engaging, meaningful and enduring as the experiences are grounded on the national 
standards of Social Studies.

SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief systems, such 
as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and beliefs? What does 
language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, sociology and anthropology, 
as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one to 
develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? How has 
the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme typically appears in 
courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things located? 
Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have for people? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to adulthood? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are maintained or 
changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by institutions? How do 
institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with sociology, 
anthropology, psychology, political science and history.  
 
 
 


 
11 | P a g e  
 
 
Power, Authority  
Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is power? What 
form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, structured, maintained 
and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing 
with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of the 
factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic concepts 
and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is new 
technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which is 
unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people benefit 
from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural and physical 
sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, civics and 
government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme typically 
appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. Students 
confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the balance 
between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world community? How can I 
make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, cultural anthropology and 
fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

Bahamas. 
 
3. Identify and label key 
elements of the Lucayans’ 
way of life. 
 
4. Compare the leadership style 
of the Cacique to the 
leadership styles of today. 
 
 
The Lucayans were the early 
settlers of The Bahamas.  
 
They were peaceful and came 
from Caribbean islands to escape 
the cruel Carib warriors.   
 
They wore special clothing and 
had a unique look.   
 
Their homes were huts. The  
Lucayans fished, hunted and 
farmed as a way of life. 
 
The leader of the group was 
called a Cacique or chief. 
 Comparison Game 
e.g.  We live in houses, but 
Lucayans lived in huts. 
 
 Draw and colour pictures of 
the Lucayans. 
 
 Group Activity – Build 
sample huts

The ocean is represented by blue. 
It is the water that separates the 
countries into four general 
directions north, south, east and 
west.   
 
The Bahamas is made up of many 
islands.  
Cat Island, Exuma, Rum Cay, 
Long Island and San Salvador are 
islands found in the Central 
Bahamas.

The Bahamas. 
 
Maps are used to give directions. 
Aviators can use a map to locate 
airports and identify the 
settlements on the island.  Special 
symbols are placed on the map to 
help us find this information.  A 
four-point compass is a tool used 
to show directions.   If you are on 
one island, the four-point compass 
can tell you which islands are 
north, south, east and west of that 
island.

the changes we experience around 
us. 
 
In The Bahamas, we experience a 
mild winter, spring and very little 
autumn and lots of summer 
months. 
 
Weather conditions such as wind, 
rain and heat change often.  As the 
weather changes, so do we. We

In The Bahamas, the most 
dangerous weather condition that 
threatens our country each year is 
a hurricane or hurricanes 
depending on whether or not the 
season is very active. 
 
A hurricane is a dangerous storm 
with strong winds and heavy rain 
that can last for hours or even 
days.   
 
These winds often destroy homes 
and the rain causes flooding in the 
community.  It is important to

Things that are used in the 
environment are called resources.  
Some resources come from nature.  
These are called natural resources.  
 
In The Bahamas, we use the natural 
resources of sun, sand and sea to 
attract visitors from all over the 
world.  We use straw from the 
native palm trees to create beautiful 
baskets, hats, bags and mats for the 
tourists to purchase and take home 
as souvenirs. A souvenir is a thing 
that is kept as a reminder of a 
person, place or event. 
 
Many Bahamian use fish and conch 
from the sea for food.   
 
Nature has provided us with these 
resources and we use them to make 
money and survive.   We must 
preserve our environment and 
natural resources.  Preservation is to 
keep in a good condition, preserve.

4. Discuss ways in which we can 
conserve or preserve our 
natural resources. 
 
 
We should try to use these 
resources wisely.  If we do not 
preserve them, then we will lose 
them.  
 
Litter is an easy way to destroy our 
natural resources.  Cans, bottles 
and plastic of any form can find 
their way in our waters and kill our 
reef. This causes the fish to move 
away.  
 
Visitors to our country love the 
clean beaches and beautiful plant 
and animal life.  Litter takes away 
from that beauty.  It also creates a 
health risk in our communities as 
the rat, roaches, flies and mosquito 
population will increase.

and different members play 
different roles in the communities. 
 
The leaders of the community see 
to the needs of all members and set 
the rules that they should follow. 
All leaders depend on helpers to 
get the job done.  At school, the 
leader is the principal. The 
principal has many helpers. These 
are the teachers, nurse, counselors, 
janitors and security guards.  
 
These helpers each have a job to 
do to ensure that the needs of the

The Bahamas. He is considered 
the father of our nation. He along 
with Sir Milo Butler fought to 
make The Bahamas a better place 
for all Bahamians.  His 
Excellency, Sir Milo B. Butler 
was born in New Providence on 
11th August, 1906. 
 
In 1956, Sir Milo tossed the 
Speaker’s hour glass through the

the 
House 
of 
Assembly. 
 
On the 27th April, 1965, a day 
known as ‘Black Tuesday’, after 
delivering his speech, Lynden 
Pindling, then Leader of the 
Opposition, threw the Speaker’s 
Mace out of the window of the

First, fishermen load their boats 
with wire traps or nets used to 
catch fish.  Then they sail out to

nets or traps. 
 
Later, they return to the spot and 
pull the net and traps back on the

3. Identify things we transport 
around the country. 
 
4. Compare two forms of

5. Discuss the advantages of

transportation. 
Transportation is the way we move 
people and things from one place to 
another. On land, there are many 
forms of transportation used today. 
These include walking, surrey rides, 
cars, buses, trucks and tractors.  Our 
choice of transportation depends on 
what we are moving. e.g. Tourists 
might prefer to see The Bahamas on a 
surrey ride (horse and carriage).  
However, a merchant might prefer to 
move supplies around on a truck.  
You may walk to school because you 
live very near to it, while other boys 
and girls might catch a jitney or get a 
ride with their parent or guardian 
because they live further away. 
 
The Bahamas is made up of many 
islands, so we move from one island 
to another using boats or planes.  Our 
mailboats carry letters and supplies 
called freight from one island to 
another.   
 
Planes and passenger boats like 
Bahamasair and Bahamas Air and Sea 
Link, carry people from one island to 
another.

2. Discuss the importance of 
showing appreciation for 
cultural songs and stories. 
 
 
Culture is what makes us different 
from other people in the world.  It 
makes us Bahamians.  Bahamian 
culture can only be seen through 
the life of another Bahamian. 
 
Ring plays are little rhymes we use 
to sing and dance to. 
 
Folktales are stories passed down 
from mother to child over the 
years.  It usually teaches a lesson, 
or tells a tale. 
 
It is important to pass on songs 
and stories of our culture.  This 
helps to preserve our culture and 
to give us an identity.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas. Mary Ingraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 


 
xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirations and feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

During the 70s the game declined, 
Because teachers did not know the game. 
They taught track and field and other sports, 
Which buried the cricket name.
