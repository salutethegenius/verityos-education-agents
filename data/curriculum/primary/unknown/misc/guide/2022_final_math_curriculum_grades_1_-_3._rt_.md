The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 –  2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

PROFILE OF THE IDEAL GRADUATE 


x 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
  
 
 
Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 


xi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection. 
 
MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS GRADES 1 – 12 
A DISCUSSION 


xii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example, Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics. 
 
Concepts 
 
 
 
Scheme or plan for Mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and fractions,  
 
Content Standards   
            Cover what students are to learn in various subject areas, such as Mathematics and Science.  
 
Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three. 
 
DEFINITION OF CURRICULUM TERMS 


xiv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027

xv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
                                                                                                                       
 
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


xvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at  
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended. 
 
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE 


xxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.  
 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 


xxii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested. 
BEST PRACTICES IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS 


xxv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1 - 6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students. 
 
 Teach to the needs of each group of students during guided mathematics activities. 
 
 Integrate mathematics across the curriculum. 
 
 Give tests at the end of a concept or unit.  This will identify students learning and the effectiveness of teacher strategies/practices. 
 
 Give post-test at the end of the school year to determine students’ successes.  
 
 Record results from the assessments in teachers’ Mark Book, portfolios, and formal reports. 
 
 Host Mathematics competitions to give students the opportunity to compete with their peers and solidify skills and concepts taught. 
 
 Teacher training/upgrading in mathematics instruction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 


xxvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 
Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES 


xxvii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
 
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of comprehension than those under Understand. 
 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 
Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
 putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
 production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three distracters.  
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, 
or a multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical thinking 
skills.  Furthermore, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in working with 
timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various components of the 
examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques and timed tests/ 
quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently write National 
Examinations. 
 
 CREATE…………..originate, predict, and design 
 EVALUATE………defend, revise, and measure 
 ANALYZE………..examine, deduce, and compare 
 APPLY……………classify, organize, and solve 
 UNDERSTAND…..describe, paraphrase, and summarize 
 REMEMBER……...identify, select, and state

In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                 
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful by relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life; 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


xxx 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
1. Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The  next day, 
discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
2. Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
3. Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
4. Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
5. Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
6. Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the most points?) 
and 
 
7. Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY (POD) 


xxxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can: 
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do.  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed.  
 
delete extraneous information.  
 
identify the parts in the question.  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best.  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved.  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information.  
 
share student-generated questions.  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers.   
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
*NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

14. Identify and solve fact 
families. 
a. A fact family is group of numbers that can be 
added or subtracted to get another number in 
the fact family. 
b. There are only three numbers in each family. 
Each family can have two addition facts and 
two subtraction facts. 
e.g.  5, 8, 13 (Use the order property) 
     8 + 5 = 13                5 + 8 = 13

fact family?  
 
 Create a fact family using 
3 given numbers. 
15. Explain the concepts of 
addition and subtraction 
with words, pictures, or 
concrete objects. 
 Addition is joining two or more objects/ 
elements to obtain a total/result. The 
numbers we add are called addends. The 
total after we add is called the sum. 
     Example: 4        +         3          =        7 
                  Addend   plus    addend    equals  sum 
 
 Subtraction is taking away one or more 
objects from a group of objects. The whole 
group is called the subtrahend. The number 
that is being taken away is called the 
minuend. The number that is left is called the 
difference.   Example: 8     –      3      =     5 
      subtrahend minus minuend equals difference 
 
 Zero Property: When we add zero to 
another number, the number doesn’t change. 
 Demonstrate addition and subtraction 
story problems using flannel boards or 
concrete objects.

        Say 6.  Count on 2 
                    6      7       8 
b. Doubles:  Two addends that are the same.   
                    2 + 2 = 4 
 
Doubles Plus One: An addition fact in 
which one addend is one greater than the 
other. 
                    4 + 4 = 8 
 
 
 
 
                      4 + 5 = 9 
 
 Distribute counters to pairs of students.

given, left, or closed.  
  
    Example ¼ - 1 is the numerator.  
   It means1 equal part out of four equal    parts 
of the whole.    
 
 Denominator: the number below the bar in a 
fraction.   
 
    Example ¼: 4 is the denominator.  
    It tells how many equal parts the whole   was 
shared into. 
 Have students play a card game in

 Classify: To categorize things that are similar into 
groups. 
 
 A Venn diagram is a diagram that shows what is 
alike and/or different between 2 or more sets of 
things. 
 
 Shapes can stack. This means that because of their 
flat surfaces at the top and bottom, other shapes are 
able to be placed on top of them without falling or 
rolling 
Examples: 
 
 
 Shapes can roll. This means that because of their 
curved sides, when laying down they can move 
around on the floor as a ball. 
Examples:  
 
 
 
 Shapes can slide. This means that because of their 
flat surfaces, they can move forward, back, left or 
right without rolling or falling. 
Examples: 
 
 Give each group a solid shape. 
Have each group identify the 
attributes the shape has such as 
rolling, stacking and / or sliding.

12. Recall addition and 
subtraction facts up to 
twenty (10 + 10 = 20). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Addition Facts: The addition of two single-digit 
addends producing sums to 18. 
For example: 7 + 9 = 16s 
 
Addend: a number to be added to another. 
 When zero is added to a second number, the answer 
is the second number. For example, 0 + 20= 20.  
 Adding one is just like counting by one.  
 Subtraction facts are facts you should know just by 
thinking, not counting. Once you know these facts, 
you can subtract any number easily. 
 Show the relationship between the addition and 
subtractions facts. 
 For example: 15 – 8 = 7. Ask students to think 
about what goes with 8 to make 15. The students 
use a known addition fact 
    8 + 7 = 15 to solve the subtraction fact. 
 Use flash cards and allow students 
to identify addition facts in less 
than 3 seconds. This indicates 
mastery of the fact. 
 
i. Place these cards in the “I 
know” stack. Review with 
students the facts that are easily 
retrieved. The cards that are left 
become the “I want to know” 
stack. As cards from this stack 
are learned they become the “I 
learned” stack. 
 
ii. Make labels for the stack so 
the student can see a visual 
model of 
 “K-W-L” chart of his 
subtraction facts.

14. Explain strategies used to 
arrive at sums and 
differences. 
Strategies 
  Adding 10 to a number: Adding 10 to a number 
does not require any counting. For example, 
10 + 2 =                  8 + 10 = 
10  + 5 =                 7 + 10 = 
10 + 9 =                  3 + 10 = 
 
 
Think Addition Strategy: This strategy 
demonstrates how students can use their 
knowledge of adding facts to find the answers to 
subtraction equations. For example 
 
Example: For 10-6, students should look at the 
number and think “6 plus what equals 10?’ and 
determine the missing addend. 
 
 The Count Back Strategy: If students have to 
subtract 1, 2, or even 3 from a number, they 
could employ a counting back strategy with or 
without visualizing jumping back on a number 
line. 
 Use file folder games where 
students match the sums to the 
equations. 
 
 Provide one group of students 
with addition and subtraction 
problems. Write them on 
greeting card size construction 
paper and hang them around the 
students’ neck. Give another 
group the answers to the addition 
and subtraction facts. Write them 
on greeting card size 
construction paper and hang 
them around their necks. After 
giving a signal have students 
‘find their partners’.

random addition and 
subtraction of 1, 2, and 3 
(adding 10 to a number, 
think addition, count 
back) 
 i. Students look at cards and 
verbally count back, add 
10, or think addition to 
determine the solution. 
 
 ii. Evaluate students’ answers 
to determine whether they 
used the correct strategy. 
 
 iii. Evaluate students’ 
answers to the sum and 
differences and keep track 
of right and wrong 
answers by sorting them 
as you flash.

15. Create and explain fact 
families using addition 
and subtraction skills to 
show the relationship 
between addition and 
subtraction. 
 Fact families: A fact family is a group of related 
facts using the same numbers. Example 
       4 + 3 = 7             7 – 3 = 4, 
      3 + 4 = 7             7 – 4 = 3.  
 Fact families are a very powerful tool for mastering 
facts; once you know one fact in a family, you can 
work out the other facts in the same family.  
 Fact families are also useful for solving problems 
with missing addends, such as 4 + __ = 7 
Make a Triangle: 
 On the points of the triangle write 
the digits in the fact family: 
For example:2,3, 5.  
 
 On the triangle, have the child 
write the 2 addition and 2 
subtraction facts for that family. 
You could duplicate many 
triangles, with lines for the facts. 
Then you can "customize" each 
triangle!

16.  Find the sums of 2 two-
digit numbers using a 
variety of methods 
(Continued). 
 
 Addition of two-digit numbers is developed 
sequentially, beginning by finding the sums of 
numbers that are multiples of 10.  
 
  For example: To add 40 plus 50, a child may think of 
the basic addition fact, 4 + 5 = 9, and then affix a 
zero to the five to get the sum, 90. When children do 
this, the important point to emphasize is that they are 
not really adding 4 and 5, but rather 4 tens and 5 
tens. 
Hundred Board Sums

groups cut numbers from the 
hundred board to create addition 
problems. Students then find the 
sums of the problems.

16.  Find the sums of 2 two-
digit numbers using a 
variety of methods. 
  
 Addition algorithm is based on the base-ten 
positional numeration system, and so when adding 
two-digit numbers, place value must be 
acknowledged. For example, 34 + 52.  
 
 The first digit from the left is in the tens place, and 
the second digit from the left is in the ones place. 
34 + 52 can be written in the following way: 
 
                          34        30   + 4 
                             +52    + 50   + 2 
         86        80   + 6 = 86 
 
 Adding 34 and 52 is equivalent to finding the sum 
of 3 tens (30) and 5 tens (50), and then adding to 
this result the sum of 4 ones and 2 ones. 
 Give students copies of the local

21. Subtract two-digit 
numbers with renaming. 
 
When subtracting two-digit numbers, begin 
with the ones place. If the minuend is smaller 
than the subtrahend, first rename in the tens 
place. To rename means to change 1 ten into 
ten ones. Next, add the ten ones to the 
minuend in the ones place. This will rename 
the tens digit and the ones digit. Then, subtract 
(from ones column, first).

Example: 82 – 29 =? 
 Come to the Shop! In cooperative 
learning groups, students purchase 
items from their “mini grocery 
stores”. Each group member takes 
turns being the cashier. The cashier

                5 groups of 3      = 15 
                   5 x 3 = 15 
 
 
This means that there are 5 groups of 3, 
which total 15 
 
Example: 1 bird has 2 legs 5 birds   
          
 
 In groups using manipulatives, 
students explore multiplication as

Example: Solving Problems around 
the School Using Repeated Addition 
Take students on a tour around the 
school. Have them solve problems like 
counting the number of desks and chairs 
in a classroom, computers in the 
computer lab, number of juice in a box 
sold by the lunch vendor, etc. Explain to 
them that if the desks and chairs are set 
up in rows and columns it is easier to 
multiply to find the total number, instead 
of counting each item separately.

 Use the number line to assist students with 
estimation. 
 
 Given a number, find the two numbers that come 
before and after (counting in tens) that number. 
Example: The number is 34. Between which two 
numbers (counting in tens) does this number fall? 
Answer: 30 and 40. 34 is closest to which number, 
30 or 40? It is closer to 30. Then, 34 is estimated to 
30.  
 
 Add the numbers. 
Example:  
    4 5                 5 0 
 + 7 2              +7 0 
                       1 2 0 
a. 45 is between the numbers 40 and 50. 45 is closer to 
50. Therefore, 45 is estimated to 50. 
a. 72 is between the numbers 70 and 80. 72 is closer 
to 70. Therefore, 72 is estimated to 70. 
 
 The estimated sum is 120 
For subtraction, the rule remains the same. After 
estimation, you subtract instead of add. 


1. Estimate and measure 
objects to the nearest 
metre, centimetre, or 
decimeter, feet, inches, 
yards and miles. 
 To estimate measurement, give a guess that 
comes as close as possible to the actual 
measurement of an object. To check the accuracy 
of the guess, we use a ruler to get the exact 
measurement. 
 
 Metre (m)- basic unit of measuring length in the 
metric system. 
 
 Centimetre (c) – a smaller unit of measuring 
length in the metric system. It takes 100 
centimetres to make 1 metre 
 
 Decimetre - 1/10 of a metre or 10 decimetre = 1 
metre. 
 
 
Customary Units of Length 
12 inches = 1 foot 
 3 feet = 1 yard 
1760 yards = 1 mile 
 Give each child/group an object 
and allow them to make 
reasonable estimates as to the 
length of each object based on the 
unit being used. Have them 
measure it, and write the length as 
closely as possible to its actual 
measurement e.g. which string is 
about 3cm?

3. Estimate, measure and 
then compare the mass or 
weight of objects using 
standard units. 
 Mass is how much space an object takes 
up. Weight tells how heavy or light 
something is. 
 
 In the metric system, grams (g) and 
kilograms (kg) are used to measure 
mass. 1000 grams equals 1 kilogram. 
 
 In the customary system, ounces (oz.) 
and pounds (lbs.) are used to measure 
weight. 16 oz. equals 1 pound. 
 
 
 Heavier means having more weight than 
another object. On a balance scale, the 
heavier object will lower the pan. 
 
 Light means having less weight than 
another object. On a balance scale, the 
lighter object will be on the higher pan. 
 
 To be balanced means to have the same 
weight as another. On a balance scale, 
both pans will be at the same level.  
 
 On a standard scale, you read the weight 
of an object by looking at the number 
where the marker stops. 
 Place an object on either side of a balance in the 
pans, then observe to see which is heavier (lower 
pan) or lighter (higher pan)  
 
 
 
 
  E.g. 
 
Draw objects on a sheet of paper under the 
headings. 
 
‘Heavier or lighter’    Example: 
Heavier                      Lighter 
                    
   
(ball)               
 
 Have students estimate the mass/weight of 
items, place them on the scale one at a time and 
read the scale. They will then compare the 
mass/weight of items

For examples days and months. 
 
 Example of Associations 
Christmas Day: December 25th  
Independence Day: July 10th  
Opening of school- September 
Valentine’s Day: February 14th 
 
 Using a calendar, children find and 
name the month for their birthdays. 
 
 At the start of each month, discuss 
holidays, special occasions, or 
school events that will occur. 
Highlight these events on a class 
calendar using cut-outs, Stickers,

13. Count, compare, and 
make change using a 
collection of coins 
(Bahamian and US) of 
amounts to $10.00 or 
less. 
 Count groups of coins which are 
either of the same value or mixed 
values to a total of $10.00, or less For 
example, all pennies or pennies and 
dimes  
 
 Decide whether one group of coins is 
worth more or less than another. e.g. 
 
                                                     
   less        less       less                   more 
 
 Use appropriate strategies to deduce 
how much money is left when some 
has been spent and create change. 
 E.g.  
                                     
 
 
 
       25¢ - 14¢ = 11¢ 
 
 
 
  
 
 Play a ‘shopping’ game using tagged 
items to sell. Give customers (students) 
a specific amount of money. E.g. 50¢. 
Cashier (student) must give the 
customer the correct change once he or 
she has made a ‘purchase’. 
 
Example:           
costs 26¢ 
 
     Change = 24¢.

 Plane shapes are 2 dimensional 
figures. They are also called flat 
shapes because they have length and 
width, but no thickness. 
 
 
Properties of a plane shape include 
the number straight sides and the 
number of corners.  
a. Sides are the edges of the 
shape. Corners are where two 
sides meet. 
 
 Types of plane shapes 
a. Circle: A round shape with 0 
straight sides and 0 corners. 
 
b. Rectangle: A plane shape with 
4 sides and 4 corners but 2 
sides are longer. The opposite 
sides are the same length.

of the shapes. 
3. Sort and classify solid 
shapes according to 
attributes (Continued). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sort and classify mean to separate and group. 
Three-dimensional figures may be classified by 
comparing similarities and differences in their 
attributes. 
 
 Physical attributes are visible characteristics that 
readily distinguish one figure from another e.g. 
shape, size, or colour. 
 
 Types of Movements 
c. Roll:  move by turning over  
d. Stack: arrange objects one on top of the other  
e. Slide: move to a new position without turning 
or flipping. 
 Work in teams to put a bag of 
shapes into groups, according to 
their attributes. The team that 
finishes first wins. 
 Explore properties of solid figures 
to compare their movements and 
then put them into groups 
according to their similarities.  
E.g. spheres, cones and cylinders 
can roll. 
 Trace the flat surface of solid 
shapes to see which are similar 
e.g. cylinders and cones have 
circular faces.

create the largest or smallest 
number possible. They will then 
be asked to read the number. 
 
 Note: Largest digit should be in 
the first column and the 
smallest digit should be in the 
last column when making the 
largest number possible. The 
reverse is required when 
making the smallest number 
possible.

7.  Round numbers to the 
nearest ten and hundred. 
  Rules for rounding to the nearest ten 
a. The digit in the ones place helps you to find 
the closest ten. If the digit in the ones places 
is 5 or more you round up. If the digit in the 
ones place is less than 5, the digit in the tens 
place remains the same.  
 Example: Round 43 and 47. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
43 is closer to 40 and 3 is less than 5. Therefore, 43 
rounds to 40. 
 
So, 47 is closer to 50 and 7 is greater than 5. So. 47 
rounds to 50.

Rules for rounding hundreds 
 a. Use the digit in the tens place to help you round.  
 b. If the digit in the tens place is 5 or more round 
up. If the digit in the tens place is less than 5, 
the digit in the hundreds place remains the 
same. Example: Round 334 and 386 to the 
nearest hundred.

8. Estimate sums and 
differences. 
 Remember estimate means to find the approximate 
value. 
 There are many estimation strategies. Rounding is a 
strategy that is useful for addition and subtraction. 
 
 To round numbers, determine the digit to be 
rounded. Look at the digit to its right. If it is 0-4, 
the digit in the rounding place stays the same. If it 
is 5 or more, the digit in the rounding place 
increases by 1. 
 
E.g. 
     88  →     90          =      615   →  600 
  + 91  → + 90                  167   →  200

it is better to estimate than to find 
an exact answer. 
 
(Students might suggest 
estimating the amount of school 
supplies, such as paper and 
pencils that they will need for the 
school year.) 
 
On a Budget 
 Have a store set up in the 
classroom. Items are to be 
priced at whole number values. 
Students are given a certain 
amount of money and are told to 
collect as many items that they 
can get without going over their 
budget. Students are given 2 
minutes to do this.

9. Create and solve problems 
involving the addition and 
subtraction of money. 
 Adding and subtracting money amounts is 
similar to adding and subtracting whole 
numbers.  You add to find the total price of 
more than one item. You subtract to find the 
change you will receive. 
 
 When you add and subtract money, put the 
decimal point and the dollar signs in the 
correct places. 
    ( Example:  $2.35) 
 Have students write word problems 
with money amounts.

13.  Calculate and convert 
combinations of Roman 
numbers to standard 
numerals and vice versa.  
  Roman numerals are based on addition and 
subtraction. 
Example: VI = 5+1 = 6. 
When the symbol for the smaller number is 
written to the right of the greater number, 
add.  No more than three symbols for smaller 
numbers are used this way.   
IV = 5 – 1 = 4 
When the symbol for a smaller number is to 
the left of the greater number, subtract. No 
more than one symbol for a smaller number 
is used this way.   
Examples: XX= 20; VII = 7 
Game: Mixed and Match 
a. Students form a circle and are given 
flash cards with either the Roman 
numeral or the standard number 
counterpart. 
 
b. The teacher says the word mix and 
then match 
 
c. Students find the persons with the 
Roman numeral counterpart and then 
share their findings with the class.

 Multiplication is the process of repeatedly adding the 
same number. This is also known as repeated 
addition. 
 
 Multiplying is a way to find how many in all when 
groups have the same number of items. 
 
  Example:  2 + 2 + 2  = 6 
                3 x 2 = 6 (answer)

19. Identify and use 
multiplication and 
division facts through 12 
x 12. 
 Teacher connects fact families and commutative 
property to multiplication and division facts. 
 
 The NINE multiplication facts is the one less = 
nine method. Subtract one from the number you are 
multiplying by. Example 9 x 5 (One less than 5 is 
4). The first number in the answer is 4.  The two 
numbers that make up the answer will equal 9. 
So 4 + __ = 9 (5). The last number in the answer is 
5. 9 x 5 = 45. One less than 5 is 4 (45)  
The answer adds up to nine. 4 + 5 = 9  
 Put students in groups and assign 
each group a multiplication table. 
Let the group work together to 
create a poster that illustrates a 
viable strategy that can be applied 
to find solutions to those facts.

 Fact family is a group of math facts

numbers. The fact family shows the relationships 
between the three numbers involved. 
 
 In a multiplication and division fact family, there 
are four multiplication and division sentences 
created using three numbers.  
 
Example: Write a fact family using 4, 3, and 12 
4 x 3 = 12       12 ÷ 3 = 4 
3 x 4 = 12        12 ÷ 4 = 3

relationship between a 
fractional part and its 
whole 
 
 
 
b. Explain the role of 
the numerator and 
denominator in a 
fraction using words

 The concept of a fraction as a part-whole 
relationship is where one or more equal parts of a 
whole are compared with the total number of these 
parts that it takes to make up the whole.  
 
 
 To understand fractions as part-whole relationships, 
students need to recognise the relationship between 
the denominator (total number of equal-sized parts 
that make up the whole) and the numerator 
(number of these parts of interest).   
 
Example: 2/5 of the marbles are shaded 
   
 
 
       Read: Two fifths 
       Write: 2/5 
 
 The marbles belong in a group. The number tells 
how many parts are being counted. 
 
 The denominator tells how many equal parts are in 
the whole or group. It is the bottom number of a 
fraction. 
 
Students solve problems 
     Example:  
     Darryl has a pizza with 5 equal 
parts. He ate 2 equal parts of it on 
Monday and saved the rest for the 
next day. How many parts are left 
for Tuesday? (3/5 parts).

31. Compare and order 
fractions with different 
denominators. 
  Example: compare ⅓ and ¼  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The bar for ¼ is shorter than the bar for ⅓.  So, 
¼ < ⅓  or ⅓ > ¼ 
 
 You can order three or more fractions from 
least to greatest or from greatest to least. 
 
Example: Order the fraction from least to  
greatest.  1/10, ½, 2/6 
 
 Step 1 
 
    Compare the fractions 1/10 and ½  
 
                                         1/10 < ½ 
 
                                           ½ > 2/6 
 
Therefore: 1/10, 2/6, ½  
Order the fraction from least to greatest 1/10, 
2/6, ½ 
 Collect the cards and use them to create a 
number line on the chalkboard showing 
the fractions from least to greatest. 
 
 Put the cards in the bowl. Pick a card and 
read the fraction.  Then have players take 
cards and tell if the fractions are greater 
than or less than the one you selected. 
Continue until each player has a turn.  
Then play again with a different 
benchmark fractions. 
 
 Give students models to shade. Let them 
work in small groups to compare given 
models 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example.   ½                 6/8 = ¾  
 Let students draw from a bag with given 
fractions to compare. The student with 
the larger fraction gets a point.  The cards 
are put back in the bag and the process is 
repeated. The student who scores five 
points first is the winner.

 Equivalent fractions are fractions that represent 
the same portion of a whole or group.  
 
 When finding equivalent fractions multiply or 
divide the numerator and the denominator by the 
same number (greater than one). 
 Review: Numbers that are multiplied by one, equal 
the same number. 
Example of one as a fraction.

37. Multiply and divide tens, 
hundreds, and thousands 
by a 1-digit number. 
 
When multiplying by ten, move all the digits one 
place to the left and put a zero in the space. This 
means the ones become tens, tens become 
hundreds, and hundreds become thousands. 
     
 
When we multiply by 100, move all the digits two 
places to the left. The empty columns in the ones 
and tens places are filled by 0. 
 
 When you divide a decimal number by 10, you 
move all the digits one place to the right.  The 
number becomes ten times smaller.   
Example: 350 ÷ 10 = 3.5 
 Students solve problems using

1. Solve problems that 
involve pattern 
identification to   
    complete patterns. 
 
A pattern is a strategy that can be used to 
solve problems. 
 
 
You can use the order of shapes in a design 
to identify a pattern to solve a problem. To 
find patterns you can use the following 
steps. 
 
Step 1- Understand  
- What are you asked to find? 
- What information will you use? 
 
Step 2 
- What strategy can you use to solve the 
problem? 
 
Step 3 
     - How can you use the strategy to       
       solve the problem? 
 
Step 4 
   - How can you decide if your answer  
     is right? 
 Have students work in small groups to 
find examples of patterns in the 
classroom. Suggest that they look for 
patterns in books, magazines, on 
clothing or on object such as pencil, 
vases, or artwork that is displayed in 
the room. 
 
 Students solve problems in groups. 
Example 
It’s time for the Literacy parade. 
The third grade decides to march in 
a special formation this year. One 
student walks in the first row, two 
students walk in the second row, 
and three students walk in the third 
row. This pattern continues. 
a. If the whole third grade marches 
in 10 full rows, how many 
students are in third grade? 
b.   Use numbers, words, tables,

4.  Compare expressions 
(equations or inequalities) 
     using =, >,  and < 
(Continued). 
 An equation is a number sentence that says two 
expressions are equal. 
e.g. 5 + 3 = 10 – 2 
             8 =   8 
 Two sides of a number sentence can be equal or 
unequal.  A symbol >, <, or = tells how the sides 
compare.   
 
Example: 3 + 4       
2 + 7     
 
                          7        <         9       
 
 The symbol = means “is equal to”. In a number 
sentence, the symbol = tells that the value on the 
left is equal to the value on the right. 
 
Example  a) 9 +________   = 11 
 
                      b) 10 = 3 + ________ 
 
                      c) 17- _________ = 9

3. Apply vocabulary

a.m., p.m., noon, or

 A. M. and P. M. start immediately after midday. 
Midnight and Noon (Midday) respectively. 
 Use 12 noon and 12 midnight for clarity.  Do not 
use the terms 12.00 a.m. and 12.00 p.m. It is 
incorrect.  
 Noon is neither before or after noon; it is simply 
noon. Therefore, neither the "a.m." nor the “p.m." 
designation is correct. On the other hand, midnight 
is both 12 hours before noon and 12 hours after 
noon. Therefore, either 12 a.m. or 12 p.m. could 
work as a designation for midnight, but both would 
be ambiguous as to the date intended. 
 Every day starts precisely at midnight and a.m. start 
immediately after that point in time. 
 To avoid ambiguity, airlines, railroads, and 
insurance companies use 12.01 a.m. for an event 
beginning the day and 11.59 p.m. for ending it. 
 The hours of the day between midnight and noon

17. Make change for 
purchases $20.00 or less. 
 Change is the difference between the price of an 
item and the amount you give the clerk. The clerk 
will give back change. Example: if an item cost 
$0.47 and you give the clerk $0.50, you will 
receive $0.03 change. 
 
 Counting on is one way to make sure you get the 
correct amount of change when you buy 
something.  
 
 Subtraction is another way to ensure you get the 
correct change. 
 Divide the class into 4 or 5 
groups. Allow each group to sell 
different items (e.g. one group 
sells toys, one group food, one

1.   Classify common shapes 
(plane and solid) and 
explain their properties in 
simple terms (Continued). 
 Plane shapes are 2-dimensional shapes. They are 
also called flat shapes. They have length and width, 
but no thickness. 
e.  Properties of a plane shape include the number 
straight sides and the number of corners. 
 
 Circles, squares, triangles, rectangles and ovals 
are plane figures. 
a. Circle is a flat, round closed plane shape. All 
points on the circle are the same distance from 
the center point. A circle has 0 straight sides 
and 0 corners. 
f. Square is a rectangle with all 4 sides of equal 
length. It has four corners 
g. Rectangle is a plane shape with 4 straight 
sides and 4 corners. 2 sides are long and 2 are 
short. 
 
h. Triangle is a plane shape with 3 straight sides 
and 3 corners. 
 
Who am I? 
 Put out three or more objects 
(such as a ball, a party hat, and a 
box).  Describe one of them (it is 
round all over, it is flat on the 
bottom, it sides are all flat) and 
have the children guess which 
object you are describing. 
. 
How many sides? 
 This activity uses pattern blocks. 
If you do not have pattern blocks 
you can use other shapes or cut 
shapes with different number of 
sides from construction paper. 
Each child needs only one shape 
for this activity. 
 
 Call a number and ask children 
who have a shape with that 
number of sides to stand. (Be sure 
to call numbers such as two and 
seven, to which no one will 
stand). Then have a search for all 
different shapes that have three 
sides, four sides, five sides, six 
sides, and zero sides (the circle).

3.  Identify and draw lines of 
symmetry on plane shapes. 
  A line of symmetry is an imaginary line which divides a 
figure into equal parts.  Lines of symmetry can be drawn 
from eft to right or top to bottom on a shape. 
 
 If you fold a figure along a line of symmetry, both sides 
should be the same. Some shapes have one line of 
symmetry. Some shapes have more than one.  
 
 Shapes that can be divided into equal parts are 
symmetrical. Shapes that cannot be divided into equal 
parts are asymmetrical. 
 
Examples:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Student folds a sheet of 
paper in half and make a 
simple drawing on only one 
side of the fold. Partners 
exchange papers and try to 
complete the drawing on 
the other side of the paper,
