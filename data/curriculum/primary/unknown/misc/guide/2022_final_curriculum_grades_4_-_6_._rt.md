The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 - 2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE

In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection. 
 
 
 
MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS GRADES 1 – 12 
A DISCUSSION 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xii
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example,  Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics. 
 
Concepts 
 
 
 
Scheme or plan for Mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and fractions,  
 
Content Standards   
            Cover what students are to learn in various subject areas, such as Mathematics and Science.  
 
Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three. 
 
DEFINITION OF CURRICULUM TERMS 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xiv

The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xvi
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at 
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended.

The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.

FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested. 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS

 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1-6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students. 
 
  Teach to the needs of each group of students during guided mathematics activities. 
 
 Integrate mathematics across the curriculum. 
 
 Give tests at the end of a concept or unit.  This will identify students learning and the effectiveness of teacher strategies/practices 
 
 Give post-test at the end of the school year to determine students’ successes.  
 
 Record results from the assessments in teachers’ Mark Book, portfolios, and formal reports. 
 
 Host Mathematics competitions to give students the opportunity to compete with their peers and solidify skills and concepts taught. 
 
 Teacher training/upgrading in mathematics instruction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxvi
 
 
 
 
 
The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment. 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES  


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxvii
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of understanding than those under Understand. 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
  putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
  production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three  distracters.  
 
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, or a 
multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxix
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical 
thinking skills.  Further, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in 
working with timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various 
components of the examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques 
and timed tests/ quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently 
write National Examinations.

   In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                  
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful bay relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life. 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics; 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxxi
 
 
 
 
Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
i. 
Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The 
next day, discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
ii. 
Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
iii. 
Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
iv. 
 Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
v. 
Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
vi. 
Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the    
             most points?); and 
 
    vii.   Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxxii
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can  
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed  
 
delete extraneous information  
 
identify the parts in the question  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information  
 
share student-generated questions  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers   
 
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
**NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

3. Round whole numbers to 
the nearest thousand, 
ten thousand and 
hundred thousand 
(Continued).  
 Rounding is a method used to replace a 
number with another number that tells 
about how many or how much.  
 Rounding Rules 
a. Find the place to which you want to   
round. 
b. Look at the digit to its right. If the 
digit is less than 5, the digit in the 
rounding place stays the same. If the 
digit is 5 or more, the digit in the 
rounding place increases by 1. 
-Note: All digits to the RIGHT of 
the rounding place become zeros. 
All digits to the LEFT of the 
rounding place remain the same. 
 Examples: 
-  Round 374 to the nearest ten.  
a.  Find the rounding place, Tens  
b. Ask: i. What digit do I look at? The 
digit in the ones place -4. 
  ii. Is it less or more than 5? It is less   
than 5. 
        iii. What happens to the digit in the 
ones place? It remains the same-7. 
        iv. What happens to the digit to the left 
of the tens place? It remains the 
same-3. 
 Rounding Riddle 
I am now the number 360 000. I was rounded to the 
nearest ten thousand. I was the number between 352 678 
and 352 680. What number was my original name? 
 - The same principle applies for rounding to the 
nearest ten thousand and hundred thousand.  
 
 Rounding Concentration 
Have two sets of cards: One set with the original 
numbers and the other set with the matching rounded 
numbers. 
 
- Guide students to match pairs of cards and explain 
choice of selection.

3. Round whole numbers to the 
nearest thousand, ten 
thousand and hundred 
thousand. 
  v. What happens to the digit to the right 
of the tens place? It becomes a zero. 
Therefore, 374 rounded to the 
nearest ten is 370.  
 
Round 374 to the nearest hundred 
 
Find the rounding place: hundreds. 
Ask: 
 a. What digit do I look at? The digit in  
the tens place: 7 
 b.   Is it (7) less or more than 5? It is 
more than 5 
 c. What happens to the digit in the 
hundreds place? It increases by 1  
    (3 + 1). 
d. What happens to the digits to the 
right of the hundreds place? They 
become zeros. 
 
Therefore, 374 rounded to the 
nearest hundred is 400. 
 
       - Round 2641 to the nearest thousand. 
To round to the nearest thousand, 
follow the rounding rules. 
Therefore, 2 641 rounded to the 
nearest thousand is 3 000.

9. Compare and order decimal 
through thousandths. 
 
 Use place value. Start at the left. Look 
for the first place where the digits are 
different. 
Example: 0. 472 ; 0. 679 
9 thousandths > 2 thousandths 
0. 6790 > 0.472 
 
 
   
  Use place value to solve word problems 
 
A penny made in 1982 weighs about 
0.129 ounce. A penny made in 2006 
weighs about 0.120 ounce. Which 
penny weighs more, a 1982 or 2006 
penny? 
 
a. Use place value to solve problem.  
0.129  ; 0.120 
- Start at the left. Look for the first place 
where the digits are different. 
9 thousandths > 0 thousandths 
0.129> 0.120 
 
Therefore, a penny made in 1982 weighs 
more than a penny in 2006.

17.   Find the product of 2 whole 
numbers when one factor has 2 
digits or less and the other has 
3 digits or less. (Use 
estimation, paper, pencil and 
calculator). 
 
 To find about how many, you can 
estimate. You can use rounding or 
front-end estimation to estimate 
products. 
       E.g. 178 x 13.  
    -Round each number.

21.  Explain what a remainder 
means in a division problem 
(Continued). 
 
To divide means to share a number 
of items to find how many equal 
groups can be made or how many 
items will be in each group. 
Sometimes you cannot divide 
numbers or numbers of object 
evenly. 
 
 
REMAINDER is the amount that is 
left over when a number cannot be 
divided evenly.

        - 36 
            1 
- 
Divide 37 by 6 
- Multiply 6 by 6 
- Subtract 36 from 37 
- Compare 1<6 
The quotient is 6 and the remainder 
is 1 
 
NB: The difference must be less than 
the divisor.  
 Interpreting the remainder is a 
necessary skill in solving division 
word problems. 
 
Use counters to show remainders. 
Example: use 20 counters. Draw 6 
circles

23. Estimate addition and 
multiplication up to two digits 
by three digits. 
 There are many ways to estimate like 
using compatible numbers, rounding 
and using front-end estimation.  
 
 Front end estimation 
involves rounding and adding, 
subtracting or multiplying numbers in 
the leftmost place or the very last 
number on the left. 
 
 This means that all numbers in other 
places will be zeros except the 
number in the leftmost place after the

numerator and denominator have no common 
factor other than 1. e.g. Write 4/12 in simplest 
form by dividing twice. 
 
  4   ÷  2   = 2

32. Add and subtract fractions and  
      mixed numbers with like     
      denominators without  
      regrouping/renaming 
(Continued) . 
 
 Fractions that have the same 
denominators are called like fractions. 
 
 You can use fraction bars to add 
fractions and to find the sum in 
simplest form.  
 
 Like fractions can be subtracted by 
subtracting the numerators; the 
denominator stays the same.  
 
Example: 5/6 – 1/ 6= 4/6 
 
 -Simplify by dividing the numerator 
and denominator by 2 
  4   ÷   2    =   2

Use fraction bars to find the 
sum.  
        ¼ + 2/4 = ¾  
 
4/10 + 4/10 = 8/10 or 4/5 
 
-Use fraction bars to find 
the difference 
11/12 – 6/12 = 5/12 
33. Explain why like denominators 
are needed in the addition and 
subtraction of fractions.  
  To add and subtract fractions with 
unlike denominators, change to 
equivalent fractions.  
 
 Fractions with unlike denominators 
cannot be added and subtracted unless 
you find the common denominator. 
 
 Without denominators, the number is 
not a fraction. 
 
E.g. 1 + 1    = 2 + 1 = 3 
            2    4       4     4    4 
 
a. Change one fraction so that they both 
have the same denominator. One half 
is the same as two quarters. 
 
b. Add the numerators together to find 
the answer.

4. Investigate the pattern of 
remainders in division 
by 2, 3, and 4 
(Continued). 
 
 A rule can be used to describe a 
pattern. 
 When you divide one number by 
another, and have left over, that 
amount is called the remainder. You 
will get remainders when you are 
dividing whole numbers and you 
are not using decimal values. 
Examples: 
5 ÷ 2 = 2 with remainder 1 
7 ÷ 2 = 3 with remainder 1 
5 ÷ 3 = 1 with remainder 2 
5 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 1 (4 + 1) 
6 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 2 (4 + 2) 
7 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 3 (4 + 3) 
9 ÷ 4 = 2 with remainder 1 (4 + 4 +1)  
 
6 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 1 (5 + 1) 
7 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 2 (5 + 2) 
8 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 3 (5 + 3) 
9 ÷ 4 = 1 with remainder 4 (5 + 4) 
 Divide the Line: 
a. Line up students (30-Numbers will 
vary depending of class size). 
b. Teacher asks, “If you put 30 
students into one group, how many 
groups will you have?”  
      (1 group) 
c. Teacher instructs students to form 2 
groups and asks, “If you place 30 
students into two groups, how 
many students will be in each 
group?” (15 students) 
d. This continues until as many 
groups as possible can be formed. 
e. Students will eventually predict the 
amount of groups, totals, and 
remainder (patterns).

17. Read and write time to the      
twenty-four hour clock. 
 The military tells time using a 24-
hour clock, beginning at midnight, 
which is 0000 hours. So, 1:00 a.m. is 
0100 hours, 2:00 a.m. is 0200 hours, 
and so-on up until 11:00 p.m. which 
is 2300 hours. 
  
 A 24-hour clock is an "extension" of 
a 12-hour clock. 
 
 When a 12-hour clock reaches 
12:59 and resets to 1:00, the 24-
hour clock keeps going to 13:00 
and onward. 
 
  The bigger the hour number is on 
the clock, the later it is in any given 
day. 
 
 Subtract 12 from the hour of any 
time past 12:00 on the 24-hour clock 
to find its 12-hour p.m. counterpart. 
For example, 15:34 minus 12 hours 
is 3:34 p.m 
 
 In cooperative groups, students match 
time to 24-hour clock. For example:  
4:00 AM -- 0400 hrs. 
5:00 AM -- 0500 hrs.  
6:00 AM -- 0600 hrs. 
12:00 PM -- 1200 hrs.  
1:00 PM -- 1300 hrs. 
2:00 PM -- 1400 hrs.  
3:00 PM -- 1500 hrs. 
 
 Make a game out of the two clocks set 
up side by side. Cover the 12-hour 
clock with a piece of construction 
paper or fabric and have students guess 
the time on the 12-hour clock, by only 
looking at the 24-hour clock beside it. 
When they have a good grasp of the 
concept, cover the 24-hour clock and 
have the children guess its time based 
on the 12-hour clock

 A line is a straight path in a plane. It 
continues in both directions. It does not 
end. 
 
   Example:  
 
 A point is an exact position or location 
 
    Example:                   
 
 A line segment is straight. It is part of a 
line and it has two end points. 
 
   Example: .  
   
 
 
 A ray is part of a line. It has one end 
point. It is straight and continues in one 
direction.  
 
  Example:   
 
 
 An angle is formed when two rays or 
line segments share the same end point. 
The common endpoint is the vertex. 
 
Example: 
 
 Work in small groups to draw lines, 
points, line segments, rays, and angles 
on construction paper and grid paper.

1. Graph data on a line graph. 
 Information about people or things is 
called data.  Data can be collected and 
organized in different ways. 
 A line graph connects points to show 
how data changes over time. 
 
 
  The scale consists of numbers that 
show the units used on a graph. 
 The interval is the amount between 
tick marks on the scale. 
 Students collect data; then show data 
on line graph. Example:  Number of 
bicycles that was sold for seven 
months (January – July) or the 
temperature recorded for one week etc. 
 Give graphs a title, scale, and labels.  
Talk about the data collected then 
show how to place points on the grid 
for each number in the table.  Connect 
the points to make the line. 
 Analyze line graphs through 
discussion.  
Example: 
a. Does a line graph have a scale? 
b. Does a line graph show a range? 
c. Does a line graph show a mode? 
d. Can you make prediction based on

are used to collect data. In a vertical bar 
graph, the bars go up from the bottom. In 
a horizontal bar graph, the bars go across 
from the left. 
 Line graphs show data change over time. 
 NOTE: Do not confuse bar graphs and 
histograms. The bars in bar graphs do not 
touch but in a histogram they do. 
         Example of a Histogram 
                           Salaries

3. Compare and order whole 
numbers, fractions, and decimals 
using < , >, and  = (continued) 
 
 Line up the decimal points. 
Compare the digits in the 
greatest place. 
             1.23 
 
0.98 
           0 < 1 
 
            1.28 
Since 0  <   1, then  0.98 is the least 
number. 
       
Step 2: Compare the tenths. 
                 1.23 
 
                 1.28                   2 = 2 
There is the same number of 
tenths. 
 
Step 3: Compare the hundredths 
            1.23 
 
            1.28                        3 > 8 
So, the order from least to greatest 
is 0.98; 1.23; 1.28 
 
Students use number line to order 
numbers. 
Example:  9.4; 9.63; and 9.27 from 
greatest to least. 
 
                
 
 
So the order is 9.63, 9.4, 9.27

3. Compare and order whole 
numbers, fractions, and decimals 
using < , >, and  =. 
 
 Write the decimal from greatest to 
least order. Example: 0.813; 0.6; 
0.65  
 
0.813     think    8 > 6, so 0.813 is the     
greatest 
0.6         0.600       0.6 is equivalent 
to   0.0600 
                                0.65 is equivalent 
to  0.650                
0.65       0.650    0 > 5, so 0.6 is the 
least 
 
The order from least to greatest is 0.6; 
0.65; 0.813 
 In cooperative groups, create whole 
numbers, fractions and decimals problems 
and compare them using the relative 
symbols.

4. Order fractions, decimals, and 
whole numbers in ascending 
and descending order.  
 
 Ordering fractions shows which is 
more, less, or equal. 
 
 Symbols such as >, <, or = are used 
to order fractions, decimals and 
whole numbers. 
 Example 1/6 < 1/2 < 2/3 
 Compare given fractions using fraction 
bars. 
Example: 
Compare ½ and ⅔ by using fraction bars. 
Step 1. Start with the bar. For 1, line up 
fraction bar for 1/2. 
 
Step 2. Line up the fraction bar for ⅔. 
Compare the two rows of fraction bars. 
The longer row represents the greater 
fraction.

between even/ odd numbers, 
whole numbers, fractions, 
decimals, and perfect squares 
(Continued). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Even numbers are divisible by 2 and 
end with a digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  
Example: 2 ;   48  ;     4 000 
 
 Odd numbers are not divisible by 2. 
Odd numbers always end with a digit of 
1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. 
Example: 47 ; 139;  47 003 
 
  Whole numbers (one of the numbers 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4 … The set of whole numbers 
go on without end.  
 
 Fractions are equal parts of a whole or a 
region. 
 
 Decimals:  Numbers with one or more 
digits to the right of the decimal point. 
 
 A square number is the product of two 
equal factors.  
Example:  7 x7 = 49; 6 x 6 = 36 
 
 To find some square numbers start by 
multiplying 1 x 1.  So 1 is a square 
number. 
 
 The square root of a number is one of 
the 2 equal factors of the product. 
 Use grids to identify fractions and 
decimal numbers.

In one group, 18 out 30 students (18/30) prefer 
guineps to sea grapes and in a second group 24 out 
of 40 students (24/40) prefer guineps over sea 
grapes.  How do the group preference compare? 
Since 18/30 = 3/5 and 24/40 = 3/5, the same 
fraction of each group prefers guineps and sea 
grapes.

11. Convert fractions to decimals and 
vice- versa. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Understanding fractions that have a 
denominator of 10 or 100 will help you 
understand decimals. 
Example 
Write the fraction using a denominator of 
10 or 100.What decimal shows the same 
amount as ½? 
 
 ½ = ½ x 5/5 = 5/10 = 0.5 
 
So, ½ is the same as 0.5 
 
Example:  Fraction                 Decimal 
Write:       6/10                          Write: 0.6 
  Read: six tenths                  Read: six tenths 
 
 You can write a decimal for a fraction 
that has a denominator other than 10 or 
100.  
Example: 
3/5 = 0.6 
                                                   0.6 
  3 divided by 5                    5 ) 3.0

parts can be used to model fractions and 
decimals that name the same amount in 
tenths or hundredths.

12.  Round decimals to nearest 
tenths, hundredths, and 
thousandths. 
 Rounding whole numbers and 
rounding decimals are similar 
processes. 
Remember 
    a. Find the place value to which you 
want to round. 
    b. Look at the digit to the right. 
   c. If the digit is less than 5, the digit 
in the rounding place stays the 
same. 
     d. If the digit is 5 or more, the digit 
in the rounding place is increased 
by 1. 
 
Round 6.079 to the nearest hundredth.  
Look at the thousandth place 
          ↓ 
   6.079 
   Since 9>5, the digit 7 is increased by 1 
   So 6.079 rounds to 6.08      
 
 If the number in thousandths places is 
5 or more, the number in the tenths 
place is increased by 1. 
Example:  Round 0.459 to the nearest 
tenth = 0.5 
Round 1.222 to the nearest hundredth. = 
1.22 
 
 Use a number line to round to nearest 
tenths, hundredth, and thousandths. 
 
  “What is it?” 
a. Teacher asks questions that are 
answered in groups (Its academic 
format). 
    Examples: Questions 
     1) How many tenths are in the number   
24.78? 
     2) How will you round to the nearest   
tenth?

14.  Compare and order 
decimals through 
thousandths. 
 You can use a number line or place value 
to order decimals up to thousandths. 
 
 Remember: On a number line, the numbers 
to the right are greater than the numbers to 
the left. 
 
Example: Order 0.813, 0.6, 0.65 from least to 
greatest. 
 
0.813   Think: 8>6 so 0.813 is the greatest. 
   ↓ 
     0.6         0.600   0.6 is equivalent to 0.600 
   ↓               ↓    0.65 is equivalent to 0.650 
0.65        0.650        0<5 so 0.6 is the least.    
 
Therefore from least to greatest: 0.6,  
0.65, 0.813

16. Identify L.C.M and G. C. F. 
of two numbers (Continued).  
 
 Composite numbers are numbers with 
more than 2 factors. The numbers can 
be written as a product of prime factors. 
Example: 9 = 3 x 3 ; 9 x 1 
The composite numbers are 1, 3, 9 
 
 The lowest common multiple (LCM) of 
two whole numbers is the smallest 
whole number which is a multiple of 
both.  
a. For example the  
    multiples of 10 = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,… 
    multiples of 8 = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48… 
So the least common multiple of 10 and 8 
is 40 or LCM (10, 8) = 40. 
 
 The greatest common factor (GCF) of 2 
whole numbers is the largest whole 
number which is a factor both.  
 Example: Factors of 12 = 1,2,3,4, ,12 
                Factors of  15 = 1,3,5,15 
1 and 3 are common factors. The highest 
common factor is 3. 
 Use factor trees as well to find prime 
factors.  
 
 Bowling Factors 
a. Students bowl down pins using cardinal 
numbers 0-9. 
 
b. Students make a number with the pins 
that fell. Example: pins 4 ; 0 ; 9 were 
knocked down.  Students will create 
factors of 49. 
 
c. Students find the L. C.M. and H.C.F. of 
the numbers from the fallen pins. 
  
  Note: If all pins are knocked down, 
have the student bowl or try again.

17. Write numbers as products of 
prime numbers using 
exponential notation where 
appropriate. 
 
 
 
 A prime number is a positive whole number 
that has exactly 2 positive divisors, 1 and the 
number itself.  A prime number cannot be 
factored. 
Note:  1 is not a prime number because it 
has only 1 divisor. 
 
 A composite number has more than two 
distinct factors (divisors). 
 
 The product of prime numbers can be 
represented by the prime factorization 
method. 
 Example: Write the prime factorization of 60 
   60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x  5   
   60 = 2² x 3 x 5 
 
 You can use a factor tree to find the prime 
factors of composite numbers. A factor tree 
of 30 
                              30 
 
                      10    x     3 
 
                  2  x   5    x     3 
 
                   So 30 =  2 x 3 x 5. 
 Write each number as a product of prime factors 
using exponential notation where appropriate. 
      1) 22                 2) 120              3) 84 
 
4) Write the missing factors 
    150= __  3 x 5 x 5__ 
 
 Pulley Prime 
 a. Use a pulley system to fish three or four prime 
numbers out of a bucket of water.  
 
 b. Students will use the prime number they fished 
to write numbers as products of prime numbers. 
They will be allowed to discard one number 
only. 
 
c. The student with the greatest number (product) 
is the winner.

19.   Estimate and create answers 
to solve single and multi-step 
problems involving addition 
and subtraction of whole 
numbers, money, fractions, 
and decimals (Continued). 
 
 
 
 
 Computational estimation is a 
process of developing an answer or 
answers that are close enough to 
enable good decision with making 
exact computations. 
 
 Exact computations can help by 
building a better sense of estimating 
answers first. 
 
 Front End Estimation 
This is where you use only the most 
important digits, ignore the rest. 
Example: 
    $4.092                      $4.000 
    $7.351                      $7.000 
+  $8.973                 +  $8.000 
    ______                     $19.00    
 
 Adjusting and compensation 
Students should be taught that values 
being analyzed can be seen as a little 
more, a lot more, or a little less. 
Example: Subtraction 
 
   $ 7.351               _  $7.000 
   -  4.092                   $4.000 
   $ 3.259                   $3.000 
 
 Without calculating an exact answer, 
circle the best estimate for 72 ÷ 
0.025 
       a. A lot less than 72 
 b. A little less than 72 
 c. A Little more than 72 
 d. A lot more than 72 
 
 In pairs, students create single and 
multi-step problems. Another pair in 
the class solves the problems. 
Students report findings.  
 
 Do I Have Enough? 
 a. Students are exposed to the 
classroom store where items are 
clearly priced. Students are given a 
certain amount of money to shop. 
For example, $15.00. 
 
b. Students are challenged to select 
four items that when purchased will 
leave them with more than $2.00 or 
less than a $1.00.

20. Estimate using several 
methods including rounding. 
 Flexible numbers can be changed or 
reformulated. Round number that are 
close and easy to formulate. This is 
particularly suited for multiplication. 
 
 Clustering or averaging: 
When numbers need to be totaled, 
sometimes you can find the answer by 
estimating an average of them e.g.  
 
Estimate the total. 
                 52                       60

 Now you can take the average and 
multiply it by how many numbers you 
have added.  
 
a. Students estimate the average weekly 
temperatures. 
b.   Students can create a graph of choice   
to represent the information.

21.  Recall basic addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, 
and division facts, with a 3 
second per fact standard 
(Continued). 
 Addition order property: Changing 
the order of the addends does not 
change the sum. 
 
            9 + 7     =   16 
                addends       sum 
 
                   7 + 9 = 16 
 Zero property: When you add zero to 
a number, the sum is that number. 
12 + 0 =12    0 + 25 = 25 
 
 Subtraction Facts: Addition and 
subtraction are related. They are 
inverse operations. There are 100 basic 
subtraction facts. These results from 
the difference between one addend and 
the sum for all one digit addends.   
 
 Grouping Property of Addition: 
When you group addends in different 
ways, the sums are the same.        
   9 + (15 + 5) = (9 + 15) + 5 
   9 +      20      =    24 + 5

28. Use divisibility 
rules for 2, 3, 5, 10. 
 
Number 
Rule 
2 
Even numbers are divisible by  
2 
3 
If the sum of the digit is 
divisible by 3, then the number 
is divisible by 3.  
5 
If the last digit is a 5 or 0, the 
number is divided by 5. 
9 
If the sum of the digits is  
divisible by 9,then the number 
is divisible by 9 
10 
 If the last digit is 0, the 
number is divisible by 10. 
 
Example 
    5 766;   
Strategy: Add the digits 
5 766 → 5  + 7  + 6 + 6 = 24 
 Ask: Is 24 divisible by 3? If yes, so is 5 766. 
 
 
 
 Grab Bag 
c. Place students in groups and give each 
group 6 grab bags. 
 
d. Give each group 2 minutes to correctly

29. Multiply and divided by 
multiples and powers of 
10 as a mental arithmetic 
strategy. 
 Use basic facts and patterns to find 
quotients mentally.  
Example: find 1.800  ÷   3 
Dividend              divisor                 quotient 
21          ÷                3    =                       7 
210        ÷                3     =                     70 
2100      ÷                3     =                    700 
    ↑↑                                                       ↑ ↑ 
two zeros                                        two zeros 
 
 Basic facts and patterns can be used to help 
you find products mentally.  If you want to 
find the total number of pennies in 7 rolls 
of pennies with each roll having 50 pennies 
 
 50 Think 
 x7              50 = 5 x 10, or    5 tens 
 350            7 x   5 tens     =  35 tens 
                   35 tens           =  35 x10 or  350 
Examples 
7 x  20      =   140 
7  x 200    =     1.400 
7  x 2.000 =     14.000 
 
As the number of zeros in a factor increases, 
the number of zero in the product increases. 
 
 Read My Mind 
a. Teacher places a card into a hat and 
gives two facts about it. Example: My 
quotient is 27 and my dividend is 2 
700, what is my divisor? 
 
b. Selected students will give answers

30. Check answers to multiplication  
      and division problems using     
      inverse operations. 
 Multiplication and division are inverse 
operations or opposite to each other.  
Example: 
4  x   6  = 24          24 ÷ 4 = 6 
 
  A set of related multiplication and 
division equations using the same 
numbers is a fact family. 
Example: 
 9 x 4 = 36     36 ÷ 4 = 9 
 4 x 9 = 36     36 ÷ 9 = 4 
 Inverse Moment 
 a. Students are placed into two 
groups. One group gives a 
multiplication sentence while 
the other group gives the 
division inverse operation in

operations 
 
 
 When evaluating expressions with 
more than one operation, you need to 
know which operation to do first. 
 Order of operations is used to solve 
expressions with more than one 
operation. 
 Steps to consider: 
a. First, operate inside the 
parentheses. 
b. Next, multiply and divide from left 
to right. 
c. Then, add and subtract from left to 
right. 
Example                               
3 (9 + 7) ÷ 2 
3   x 16    ÷ 2 
48   ÷  2 = 24 
 What’s the Error?

32. Multiplying decimals by a 
decimal number. 
 Steps to multiply decimals 
Step 1: Multiply the numbers and 
ignore the decimal points. 
 
 Step 2: Count up how many number 
of digits that come after the decimal 
points in both factors. 
 
 Step 3: Place the decimal in the 
product so that the same number of 
digits comes after the decimal point in 
the answer. 
 
 Step 4: (Optional) Estimate the 
answer to see if your answer and the 
placement of your decimal point are 
reasonable. 
Example:  23.8 x 4.1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, 23.8 x 4.1 = 97.58

37.  Read and write Roman 
       Numerals to D. 
 
  Roman numerals are written using seven 
different letters:  
I - 1  
V -5  
X - 10  
L - 50  
C -100  
D - 500  
M- 1000  
 
 The seven letters are used to make up 
thousands of others. For example, the 
Roman numeral for two is written as II 
which is just two one's written side by 
side. 
 
 Rule 1: When a smaller symbol is after a 
greater symbol, it's added. 
 
 Rule 2: If a symbol comes after itself, it's 
added.  
 
 Rule 3: When a smaller symbol appears 
before a greater symbol, it is subtracted.  
 
 Rule 4: The same symbol cannot be used 
more than three times in a row.

1. Investigate, describe and extend 
numerical and geometric patterns 
including: triangular numbers, 
perfect squares, patterns formed 
by powers of tens and arithmetic 
sequences (Continued). 
 
 
 
 Numerical Patterns: Patterns that are created 
using numbers. 
Example:  Division Patterns 
               80 ÷ 20 = 4 
             800 ÷ 20 = 40 
          8000 ÷ 20 = 400 
 
 Geometric Patterns: Geometric Patterns are 
patterns that are created using geometrical 
shapes. 
 
Example:   
      a.          b.           c.          d.         e.           f.   
 
 Triangular Numbers: A pattern of numbers 
that can be shown by dots arranged in the shape 
of a triangle. Some triangular numbers are 1, 3, 
6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36 
 
 Perfect square is a number that has a whole 
number as its square root.  The square root of a 
perfect square is a whole number. For example, 
0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. are all perfect squares. 
 Show a variety of numerical and  
         geometrical patterns. Allow 
students to: 
a.  categorize them as Numerical or   
    Geometrical 
b. provide explanations.

sequences. 
 
 
Powers of ten are numbers that 
begin with the digits 1 and 0: 10, 
100, 1000… 
 
 
To multiply a whole number by 
powers of ten, move the decimal 
point one place to the right for 
each power of 10. 
 
Example: 
1.24  x 10    = 12.4 
      1.24 x 100   = 124 
      1.24 x 1000 = 1240 
 Take a field trip to inspect the 
architecture of churches or other 
buildings.  Have students highlight 
the areas that have square patterns 
by: 
 
a. taking photos 
b. recording via writing 
c. drawing 
 
 Let students create and laminate

4. Estimate and measure 
perimeter of objects. 
 
The perimeter is the distance around an 
object.  You can use a formula, or 
mathematical rule, to find the perimeter. 
 
   Example:  The perimeter formula for a 
pentagon is:  
 P = a + b + c + d + e  
The length of each side is represented by a 
variable. 
 
 
Estimating is the mental process of arriving 
at a measurement without the aid of 
measuring instruments. 
 
 
One strategy in estimating measurement is 
comparing a referent. If you know the 
perimeter of a student desk, then you can 
estimate the perimeter of two students’ 
desk.  
Find the perimeter: 
 
                   
 
 
Perimeter = a + b + c + d + e 
P = 14m +17m + 13m + 15m + 16m 
P = 75m 
 
 Give students many examples of 
squares and rectangles to find the 
perimeter. Discuss, “has anyone 
found a short cut to calculating the 
perimeter of a rectangle or a 
square?” 
 
 Measure and record the perimeter 
of certain areas in their school.  
Example. Office 
 
                                        20 1/8' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P = a + b + c + d + e 
P = 15' + 20 1/8 + 18½ + 9¼ + 11 1/8 
P = 74'

6. Identify and describe the 
circumference of a circle. 
 The diameter of a circle is the 
length of the line through the center 
and touching two points on its edge.   
 Pi is π = 3.14  or 22/7. 
 
 π originated from studies of the 
relationship between the 
circumference and the diameter.  
 
 The circumference C equals π times 
the diameter d or c = πd.  
 
 Formula for circumference of 
a circle is c = πd or C = 2πr 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After a table is complete, have students add their 
data to a class list (on an overhead or at the 
board).

7. Calculate the area of 
rectangles and squares 
using cm2, m2, and km2. 
 Area is the number of square units 
needed to cover a surface.  You can 
count square units to find area. 
 
 You can also use a formula for the 
area of a rectangle. 
     Area = length x width or A= l x w. 
 Work with a partner. Cut out the triangles below 
from each of your sheets. Tape them together to 
form a parallelogram.

9. Estimate and measure volume 
with appropriate units. 
 The measure of the space that a solid figure 
occupies is called volume. Volume is measured 
in cubic units. 
 
 You can find volume in two ways: (a) count the 
numbers of cubes as you build a 6 cube x 2 
cube x 3 cube rectangular prism or (b) multiply 
the length, width and height of the rectangular 
prism to find the volume in cubic units. 
Find the volume 
 Have students estimate the length width 
and height of boxes. Then have them 
multiply the dimensions to estimate the 
volume of the box. Students record the 
estimated volumes.

12.Create and solve problems with 
capacity measures. 
 Capacity is an attribute of a 
container that can be introduced to 
young children by asking, “Which 
holds more?” 
Capacity  
1 liter (L) = 1,000 milliliters  
1 metric cup = 250 milliliters. 
 
    1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 3 teaspoons  
(tbsp)  
     1 cup ( c )   = 8 fluid ounces (fl.  
oz)  
     1 pint (pt.)    =  2cups  
     1 quart (qt)  =  2pints  
     1 gallon(gal) = 4 quarts 
 
Examples 
How many quarts are in 2 gallons? 
           2 gal =   ____qt  
 
gallons     quarts in 1gallon        quarts 
     ↓                               ↓                  ↓ 
     2         x                    4         =       8 
So,     2 gallons equals       4 quarts 
 
 Students view containers and state, 
which one holds the most and least 
liquid. Students justify their 
responses. 
 
 
 
  Students are placed in cooperative 
groups where they solve problems 
with capacity measures. Students

13. Use standard units to 
estimate and measure 
mass. 
 Mass is the amount of matter in an object  
 
       Mass        /         Weight 
1 grams(g) = 1 000(mg)        1 pound   =   160oz  
1kg   = 1 000 grams             1 ton  =     2 000lbs 
 
Example 
How many grams are equivalent to 2 
kilograms? 
Think: there are 1,000 grams in 1 kg  
2 kg =   2  x  1 000   =  2 000g  
So,  2 000g are equivalent to 2 kg 
    
  
 
 Choose the more reasonable measurement 
for the objects. 
                         
     
  
      
    
 
  1g or 1kg      5g  or 5kg      200g or 20kg    600g or 600kg 
 
 Use standard units to estimate and measure 
mass of certain items. Students then 
compare estimated results with actual 
results. 
 Group Activity: 
a. Distribute a paper clip and mathematics 
textbook to each group. Each group 
makes a list of as many items as they can 
with 3 minutes that are about the same 
mass as the paper clip or the mathematics 
textbook. 
 
b. A representative from each group reads 
the group’s list aloud and explains their

whole numbers up to 
the billions period (12 
digits). 
                       
 
 
  
 Numbers are part of the decimal 
system. This system uses ten 
digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
single or collectively. These digits 
form whole numbers or decimal 
numbers.  
 These numbers can be written in 
standard form, expanded form, 
word form, or short word form. 
   Example:  
Standard Form:  28 964 371 045 
 
Expanded Form: 20 000 000 000 
+ 8 000 000 000 + 900 000 000 + 
60 000 000 + 4 000 000 + 300 000

 School Campaign 
a. Hold a school wide campaign “How Big 
is a Million? 
Collect one million of some small items 
(Example: one-cent coins or bottle caps). 
Allow all students to contribute, count and 
decide where to display one million of 
selected items. 
 
b. Students investigate the question: What 
size room would be needed to hold one 
million basketballs? 
 Have students play a game called “Step 
Forward”. Give a group of students 
digit cards and have them create a 
number.  Call out a place in that 
number and the student holding that 
digit must step forward. If the students 
cannot identify themselves, that digit is 
removed from the number and the 
students are removed from the game. 
The game then continues with the new 
number formed.

3. Estimate by several 
methods including 
rounding. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Estimate means to find an answer 
that is closest to the exact answer. 
The answer is found by rounding, 
by clustering, or by using 
compatible numbers.  
 Rounding means to replace a 
number with one that tells about 
how many or how much. 
 Clustering is a method of 
rounding when all the addends are 
about the same.  
Example 
  669 + 678 + 699 + 682 = 700 x 4 or  
  2800  
 
 Compatible numbers are pairs of 
numbers that are easy to compute 
mentally. 
Example: Compatible numbers 
for 6 are divisible by 6 such as 12, 
18, 24, 30, … 
  541 ÷ 7 = 490 ÷7 = 70 or 
  541 ÷ 7 = 560 ÷ 7 = 80 
 Guide students to solve problems 
using rounding, clustering, or using 
compatible numbers. 
 Show students sets of numbers.  
Example: 673 
670 
Have students tell which method was 
used to estimate rounding. Answer: 
Rounding

4.  Apply mental math strategies 
to addition and subtraction 
(Continue).  
 
 
 Mental Math strategies do not require paper 
and pencil for arithmetic calculations 
 
 Addition: Use addition properties of zero, 
commutative, or associative. 
Example 7 + (9 + 6) = (7 + 9) + 6 
 
  Compensation is a property where you add 
an amount to one number and subtract an 
amount from the other to make a simpler 
addition.  
Example 1:  58 + 72 = (58+2) + (72-2)  
This way you get an easy operation, e.g., 
   60 + 70; and you can do it mentally. 
     
Example 2:  
Change one addend to a multiple of ten and 
then adjust the other addend to maintain the 
balance.  
426 + 394 = 820 
      426 + (394 + 6) = 426 + 400     
     = 826 – 6  
     = 820

6. Apply mental math 
strategies to multiplication 
and division. 
       
 
 
Some division and multiplication strategies 
include: 
 
 When multiplying by 10, 100 or 100 
place one, two or three zeros behind the 
number. 
Example: 19 x 100 
                = 1 900 
 When multiplying by 2, double the 
number 
Example: 24 x 2 
       24 + 24 = 48 
  When multiplying by 5, multiply by 
10, then half the answer. 
Example: 23 x 5 
       23 x 10 = 230 
      230 ÷ 2 = 115  
 
 When dividing by 2, half the values 
Example: 518 ÷ 2 
       500 ÷ 2 = 250 
       18 ÷ 2 = 9 
       250 + 9 = 259 
 
 
 Guide students to compile a 
booklet with a variety of unique 
word problems. Students will 
highlight vocabulary 
words/phrases that assist with 
problem solving.

8. Apply the divisibility 
rules for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
8, 9,10. 
 
A number is divisible by another 
number when the quotient is a 
whole number and there is a 
remainder of zero. 
 Divisibility rules can help you find 
factors. 
Example: A number is divisible by:  
       a. 2 if the last digit is an even    
number. 
       b. 3 if the sum of the digits is 
divisible by 3 
        c. 4 if the last two digits form a 
number divisible by 4.  
        d. 5 if the last digit is 0 or 5 
        e. 6 if the number is divisible by 2 
and 3 
        f. 8 if the last three digits are 
divisible by 8 
        g. 9 if the sum of the digits is        
divisible  by 9 
         h. 10 if the last digit is 0. 
 Divisible Numbers 
a. Students work in groups of 2-4. 
b. Teacher gives students a number 
to use as a divisor. 
c. Students roll three to four dice 
(numbered cubes) then write as

 To multiply a whole number by a 
power of 10, add on as many 0s as 
appear in the power to the right of 
the whole number. 
Examples: 
     36 x 10 = 360 Add one 0 
   36 x 100 = 3 600 Add on two 0s 
36 x 1 000 = 36 000 Add on three 0s 
 
 To divide a whole number by a 
power of ten, start from the right 
of the whole number, separate as 
many decimal digits as there are 0s 
in the power. If there are not 
enough digits, add on 0s 
Examples: 
 
265 ÷ 10 = 26.5 Starting from the right 
of 245, separate one decimal digit. 
 
265 ÷ 100 = 2.65-Separate two decimal

17. Explain orally and in 
writing the differences 
between: even and odd 
numbers, factors and 
multiples, and square and 
square root and prime and 
composite. 
 An even number is an integer that can 
be divided exactly into two. 
 An odd number of objects cannot be 
put into groups of two without an 
object left over. 
 A multiple is the product of a given 
whole number and another whole 
number. 
 A square is the product of a number 
and it can be expressed with the 
exponent 2.   
 The square root is one of the two 
equal factors of a number. A number  
multiplied by itself equals the original 
number. 
 A prime number has only 2 factors: 
itself and 1. 
Example: 11= 11 x 1 = (1, 11) 
 Composite numbers have more than 2 
factors. 
Example: 9 = 3 x 3 ;  1x 3  = (1, 3, 9)

 Numbers can be expressed as products of prime 
numbers using exponential notation/index form.   
 A prime number is a whole number that is 
greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and 
itself. 
 Exponential notation or index form is a 
number that has a base and an exponent. The 
exponent shows how many times the number 
base is used as a factor.    
Example: 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³  
   56 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³ x 7

21. Estimate square roots of non- 
perfect squares using at least 
one of the following strategies:  
 
Identify the relationship 
between the number of 
digits in a number and the 
number of digits in its 
square root. 
 
 
Deduce that if a number 
lies between two other 
numbers then the square 
root of that number must 
lie between the square 
roots of the other two 
numbers. 
 A non -perfect square is a number that cannot 
be expressed as an integer multiplied by itself. 
 Non- perfect squares do not have square roots 
that are whole numbers. For example, 7 is not a 
perfect square. Its square root is 2.65. 
 To calculate the square root of a non-perfect 
square: 
a. place the values of the adjacent perfect 
squares on a number line. 
b. Interpolate between the points to 
estimate to the nearest tenth. 
Example √27 
i. 
The perfect square on each side of 
27 is 25 (5) and 36 (6). 
ii. 
Half way on the number line is 30. 
iii. 
Therefore, √27 is 5.2 
 Using a hundreds charts, let 
students highlight the numbers that 
are not perfect squares.

2. Solve non-routine 
problems where finding a 
pattern is an appropriate 
strategy. 
 Non-routine problems are problems that 
require non-traditional algorithms or 
sums to solve them.  
 Non-routine problems provide a more 
highly probable method for discovering 
the solution to a problem. Building a 
model, drawing pictures, work 
backwards are non-routine problem 
solving strategies. 
 Finding a pattern is a strategy in which 
you look for patterns in the data in order 
to solve the problem. Look for items or 
numbers that are repeated, or a series of 
events that are repeated. 
 Give students task card with a 
variety of problems. Allow 
them to work in groups to 
develop patterns to solve. For 
example, how many different 
handshakes would take place 
between three and four friends?

A point in a plane contains two components 
where order matters! It comes in the form 
(xx,yy) where xx comes first, and yy comes 
second. 
  
The xx-component of the point (xx,yy) 
moves the point along a horizontal line. If 
the xx-value is positive, the point moves 
“xx-units” towards the right side. On the 
other hand, if the xx-value is negative, the 
point moves “xx-units” towards the left. 
 
The yy-component of the point (xx,yy) 
moves the point along a vertical line. If 
the yy-value is positive, the point moves 
“yy-units” in an upward direction. However, 
if the yy-value is negative, the point moves 
“yy-units” in a downward direction.

 Probability is the chance that an event 
will happen. It compares the number of 
favourable outcomes and the number of 
possible outcomes. 
 
 Probability     =  number of favourable 
outcomes 
of an event      total number of possible 
outcomes

bag. He chooses one piece of paper from 
the bag without looking. What is the 
probability that Rueben will chose the 
letter B? 
 
There is 1 favourable outcome out of 6 
possible outcomes, R E U B E N. The 
outcomes are equally likely. The

indicates what could happen based on 
specific conditions. 
 Using probability to make reasonable 
predications must include all possible 
outcomes. 
 


booklet that answers questions such 
as the following: Rashad says to 
Billy “The probability of rolling a 6 
with a die is 1 to 6.   
 
Roll the die. Whenever a 6 comes up, 
you win and Rashad will pay you 
$5.00. Whenever a 6 doesn’t come 
up, I win and you pay me $5.00.”  
Billy accepts the challenge. What do 
you think will happen and why? 
 
Guide students to create a set of task 
cards with probability scenarios and 
at least two predictions of outcomes- 
one reasonable and the other 
unreasonable.
