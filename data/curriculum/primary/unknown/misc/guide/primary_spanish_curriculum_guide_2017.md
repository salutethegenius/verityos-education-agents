MESSAGE FROM THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
 
A curriculum is considered the “heart” of any learning institution, which means that schools or universities cannot exist 
without a curriculum. With its importance in formal education, curriculum has become a dynamic process due to the 
changes that occur in our society. Therefore, in its broadest sense, curriculum refers to the “total learning experiences of 
individuals not only in school, but in society as well”  
(Bilbao et al., 2008). 
 
I have always believed in the transformative power of education, particularly in a developing country, and I strongly 
support the government’s commitment to sustainable development in education.  Indeed, because of the role of the 
curriculum in the provision of quality education, I am honoured to sanction and present revised national curricula in 
several disciplines.  Each curriculum document was developed by a team of intelligent, innovative and diligent education 
officers, who received invaluable input from teachers and lecturers; students and parents; as well as private and public 
stakeholders. 
 
In keeping with the changing demands of education and life in the twenty-first century, revised curricula have moved away 
from a content-based, knowledge-focused approach.  The new documents focus on higher-order thinking skills; cross-
curricula understanding; collaboration; creativity and real world problem solving.  With a view to strengthening national 
development activities, the new curriculum documents accommodate the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals 
(SGAs), ensuring that at each grade level there are clear processes and procedures which allow teachers to align 
instructional strategies and classroom-based assessments to agreed international standards and benchmarks.  
 
The publication, dissemination and successful implementation of these curriculum guidelines will further unite us in our 
efforts to create citizens of character, who are committed to life-long learning and who are always willing to serve. 
 
To the education officers, subject specialists and teachers, who are devoted to transforming the lives of students 
throughout The Bahamas, thank you for your continued contributions to the building of our country! 
 
 
 
Hon. Jerome K. Fitzgerald 
Minister of Education, Science and Technology

MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR 
 
The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is fast becoming home to a diverse student population.  The Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM), in 2006, recognising our regional need for competence in Spanish, secured the assistance of the 
Organisation of States (OAS) for a project to enhance the teaching and learning of Spanish at the primary school level in 
all CARICOM Anglophone countries. 
 
Given our geographical location, Bahamian citizens, in particular, need to develop competencies in Spanish language in 
order to cultivate positive partnerships with future allies, clients, co-workers and friends.  This 2017 Primary Spanish 
Curriculum Guidelines document provides a clear vision of what students should know and be able to do in the target 
language.  The document’s Scope and Sequence and Scope of Work provide teachers with standards, objectives, 
activities, assessment tools and resources that will ensure that primary school students develop proficiency in the Spanish 
language, while at the same time developing cultural literacy.  
 
The Bahamas Department of Education is pleased to present this Primary Spanish Curriculum Guidelines document, 
which is designed to promote the implementation of twenty-first century foreign language teaching.   
 
Based on sound research, comparative analysis and best classroom practices, this third edition of the Primary Spanish 
Curriculum Guidelines will enable students, teachers, administrators and parents to strengthen the teaching and learning 
of Spanish in government and independent primary schools throughout the archipelago. 
 
 
 
Lionel K. Sands (Mr.) 
Director of Education

MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of the Ministry / Department of Education is to provide all persons in The Bahamas with an opportunity to 
receive an education that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes and skills required for work and life in a 
democratic society, guided by Christian values. 
 
 
MODERN LANGUAGES UNIT 
 
VISION 
 
We envision a Bahamas where students are linguistically, culturally and technologically equipped to communicate 
successfully in Spanish, which will inspire a life-long interest in and appreciation for Hispanic cultures, thereby creating 
windows of opportunity in our global village. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
To ensure student proficiency in the Spanish language, we will continue to enhance the learning environment by providing 
relevant curricula, producing indigenous materials and facilitating teacher development programmes. 
 
BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
We believe that: 
1. Language and culture are inseparable. 
 
2. Modern Languages skills are necessary for global communication and 21st century citizenship. 
3. Modern Languages instruction provides students with an improved awareness of their own language and culture. 
4. Modern Languages programmes guide students into an increased awareness and appreciation of their traditions, 
customs, and values as well as those of Hispanic countries. 
5. Teaching processes that help to reduce students’ language performance anxiety and strengthen motivation will 
enhance learning opportunities. 
6. Proficiency in Modern Languages enhances self-confidence, improves academic achievement, heightens creativity 
and sharpens mental flexibility.

RATIONALE 
 
The reality of globalisation has placed The Bahamas in a position where, to survive economically, it has to be able 
to compete internationally.     Our unique location places us in an enviable position at the crossroads between 
Europe and the Americas, including The Caribbean.   Our geographical proximity to these diverse countries 
demands that, for survival, we forge social, economic and political partnerships with bodies such as CARICOM, 
WTO, NAFTA, FTAA, and OAS.  It is incumbent upon all educators to prepare students for the multi-lingual world if 
they want to compete in any arena.  Effective communication is of paramount importance because it is at the heart 
of the human experience. 
 
To be linguistically challenged at this time in our development is a disadvantage. The Bahamas has come to realize 
that Spanish is the predominant second language in our region. It is therefore imperative that we develop language 
competency in Spanish as we advance our economy in tourism, international banking, trade and investment and 
other industries. The acquisition of a second language by our students would positively impact all areas of our 
society and permit our students and country to compete in the global arena. 
 
In order to keep pace with the changing times, the Modern Language Unit, in the Curriculum Division of the 
Department of Education, has revised the Spanish curricula. The programme at the primary school level has laid 
the foundation for the high school and continues to build on this foundation. In fact, extensive research by linguists 
on second-language acquisition has shown that children at the primary school level (ages 6 – 11) are more 
receptive to foreign language studies than are older children. Furthermore, the Society of Neuroscience has found 
that: “Being bilingual from an early age – between ages 5 and 7 – significantly affects the brain’s structure” (2008). 
 
These revised curricula will promote levels of attainment in the four language domains: listening, speaking, reading 
and writing, as our students prepare for the National Examinations. In so doing, we will be well on our way to 
becoming a multi-lingual nation. The new thrust is on communicative objectives in authentic situations, as opposed 
to topics in isolation. The curricula must cater to the diverse needs of students and are, therefore, student-centred. 
These integrated curricula reinforce links with other disciplines and promote an appreciation for cultural diversity. 
 
It is hoped that students develop a positive attitude towards foreign language-learning and, in the process, develop 
a greater measure of their true potential as life-long learners and as citizens of the Commonwealth of The 
Bahamas.

A GUIDE TO TEACHING FROM THE CURRICULUM DOCUMENT 
 
REQUIREMENTS: 
1. 
A Mandatory Sequence for Teaching Communicative Objectives can be found at the beginning of each Grade 
Level. To ensure standardisation, all teachers MUST teach these objectives as specified for each term.  Activities and 
assessment may be adjusted to meet the needs of the students, but the sequence of objectives is mandatory. 
2. 
The document is flexible; therefore instructional strategies / classroom activities should be designed for the diverse 
needs of students: low achievers as well as high-flyers. 
3. 
Sub-goals 1.1 to 1.3 are not intended to be taught separately.  They must be integrated into all Communicative 
Objectives. 
4. 
Teachers must familiarise themselves with the Standards and Scope and Sequence for the attainment levels. 
5. 
Teachers should refer to the Scope of Work for appropriate vocabulary, structures, suggested activities, suggested 
assessment and resources. 
6. 
The four linguistic skills – Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing, along with Culture, should be integrated into 
classroom instruction. 
7. 
Grammar and Vocabulary should be integrated into classroom instruction and not be taught in isolation. 
Vocabulary should be constantly expanded upon from year to year. 
8. 
Curriculum Links, including integrated technology, must be fostered.  See Appendices for a few teaching ideas. 
9. 
The methods used for assessing student achievement should reflect classroom teaching and learning strategies.  
10. 
An Assessment Weighting Guide is included in the Appendices. 
N. B. 
 
Teachers should constantly build on students’ previous knowledge, as outlined in the Scope of Work.   
Time allotment for each communicative objective should not exceed two weeks.

Structures: 
See Scope of Work, Communicative Objective 3.3, Grade 4. 
 
Behavioural Objectives: 
Having provided the students with illustrations, listening and reading activities about the family, students will be able to: 
i. Give Spanish pronunciation of vocabulary (family members). 
ii. Describe the size of their family, orally and in writing. 
iii. Respond in Spanish to the questions, ¿Cómo se llama tu papá / mamá/  hermana? [What is your father’s / mother’s / sister’s 
name?] and then ask the names of family members – also in Spanish. 
 
Introduction:  
i. The teacher will advise students that last week’s lesson on the family will be continued, with an oral review of the Spanish 
words for immediate members of the family. 
ii. Students will complete pronunciation drills of each word. 
iii. Students will listen to a song about the family. 
 
The song is deliberately repetitive, as repetition is of the utmost importance for learning a new language / developing listening and 
speaking skills. Also, Spanish is a phonetic language and the song contains all of the vowel sounds
