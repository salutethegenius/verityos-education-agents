PREFACE 
 
We live in a world that is scientifically and technologically oriented – a world of phenomenal scientific advancement and innovations. As The Bahamas 
keeps pace with this advancement, our children must be exposed to effective, comprehensive Science Education early in life. We must take advantage of their 
innate curiosity and zeal for learning about the environment before it diminishes. 
 
Science is important because it links to technology and industry, which are areas of priority for a country’s development. Science provides ways of 
making sense of the world systemically. Opportunities must be provided for our children to experience science at an early age. It is important for them 
to understand scientific ways of thinking and to have adequate knowledge of science if they are to keep pace with the technological advances and 
innovations of the 21st Century. 
 
The production of the revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines consisted of local educators who accepted the challenge of producing this document 
– a third document for the Department of Education: Science Unit (August 2001, June 2010, and December 2021). The Production Team has ensured that 
the purposes of developing sciences are met. A few of these aims are to communicate, to relate science to everyday life, and to explore, apply and 
investigate scientific and technological knowledge and ideas. 
 
In accomplishing these aims, instructional facilitators will guide students through the use of various communication modes, developing their awareness of 
the importance of science in life. Students will be encouraged to make decisions based on their knowledge of science and issues such as personal health and 
well-being, safety and the preservation of the environment. These students will be able to appreciate that experimentation is not judged by success or failure, 
but by the knowledge, which is gained from the process. 
 
The revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines grades 1-6 boasts several new features. The previous Primary Curriculum consisted of three stands; we 
introduced a fourth strand –  “Environmental Science.” More focus was given to the integration of technological skills in developing the basic concepts, skills 
and activities in the Life, Earth, Physical and Environmental Sciences. Also noteworthy in the document are the deliberate efforts to highlight skills and 
attitudes that we wish for our students to develop. 
 
When the guidelines in this revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines are effectively implemented, they will ensure that our students have the 
foundation of basic scientific concepts and principles that develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge necessary for them to successfully work and live 
in the 21st Century.

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

6. Describe physical 
changes that occur at 
each stage of human 
development. 
 
Infants are small. They 
are born with no teeth 
and sleep a lot. Infants 
cannot care for 
themselves. From a 
baby, human beings 
enter the child stage. 
Children can talk, walk 
and run. They begin to 
learn how to take care of 
themselves. From this 
stage,  a child moves into 
a teenager. Teenagers 
then become adults. 
Adults are able to care 
for themselves. They do 
not get taller but change 
as they grow older.

us learn about things. 
Everything in our 
environment is called 
matter. 
● Matter occurs in different 
shapes, sizes, colours, 
textures and weight. 
● We can change the size, 
weight, colour, shape, 
texture, state, etc. of 
matter. These changes are 
called physical changes. 
 
● A physical change occur

1. Compare 
pushes and pulls. 
A force is a push or a pull. 
Pushes and pulls make 
things move or stop 
moving. A push or a pull 
can make something 
change direction. A hard 
push moves things 
quickly, but a gentle push 
moves things slowly. 
When objects are pushed, 
they move away from us, 
but when objects are 
pulled, they move towards 
us. Heavy objects need 
more force to be moved 
than light objects. Forces 
such as wind and flowing 
water can be used to make 
things move also. 
● Making

● Collaboration 
Guess What 
1. The class will be divided into 
groups. Each group will be given 
an activity to perform by pushing 
or pulling, the other students will 
guess what the group is doing. 
3. Students demonstrate how they 
would move a big boulder. Then, 
they would demonstrate how they

2. Observe and 
identify poles of a 
magnet. 
A magnet is a piece of iron 
that can attract or pull 
things. The things it pulls are 
usually made of metal. Some 
magnets are found in nature 
(lodestone). A magnet has 
two poles. These are the 
places where its pulling 
force is strongest. Every 
magnet has a north pole and 
a south pole. They are often 
called the N pole and the S 
pole. Two poles that are 
different attract each other. 
Two poles that are the same, 
repel or push each other 
away. 
-Repel:- 
● Observations 
● Curiosity 
1. Divide students into 
groups. Give each group 3 
objects to predict whether a 
magnet will attract it or repel 
it. Then they will experiment 
to test their predictions. All of 
the objects will be classified 
under the headings: Attract 
and Repel. 
Making magnets: The 
students will be divided into 
groups. Metal objects such as 
paper clips, nail, and scissors 
will be placed in each group. 
Each object will be tested to 
see if it would attract paper 
clips. Then the objects will be 
stroked twenty times in the 
same direction. 
Magnets 
Iron filings 
Students use magnets to pick up paper 
clips, pins or thumb tacks to 
demonstrate the objects that will be 
attracted. They will draw the picture 
after making the observation. Under 
the picture, explain where the poles are 
on the magnet and state how they 
know that. 
Group assessment. Each group will be 
given objects to use as a magnet: nail, 
pen, file, comb, etc. They will stroke 
the objects to magnetize them. Then, 
they will attempt to attract objects such 
as tissue, yarn, thread, paper, etc. This 
activity will be demonstrated in front 
of the class. The assessment will be 
based on the success of the 
experiment.

actions that 
help conserve 
paper and keep

environment 
clean and litter- 
free. 
Wasting paper uses up 
trees, which are 
important in our 
environment because 
they regrow slowly. 
Littering the 
environment with paper 
and other wastes looks 
bad, harms animals, is 
unhealthy, and is not 
fair to others. 
Recycling paper 
instead of putting it in 
the trash will help save 
trees. Everyone needs 
to help save paper and 
trees and keep our 
environment beautiful 
and clean.

made all of these things to 
solve problems related to 
the weather. 
● Some workers who depend 
on weather forecasters are 
pilots, sea captains, truck 
drivers and farmers. 
1a. Dress Up for the 
Weather Role Play 
Before the Activity: Collect 
various clothes so you can 
create a Weather Dress-Up 
area in your classroom. Have 
children work in small 
groups. Explain to children 
that each group will have a 
turn dressing up for different 
kinds of weather. Once 
children are dressed up, have 
them describe the type of 
weather. Have them pretend 
to play in the weather. 
Continue with each group. 
1b. Watch the reporting of a 
weekly weather forecast 
online. Make a list of persons 
that may depend on the 
weather to their job. Discuss 
how the weather conditions 
will affect various workers. 
Circle the kind of 
weather you want to 
write about. Draw a 
picture of yourself 
dressed for that 
weather. Write a 
sentence to tell what 
kind of clothes you 
need.

3. Describe and 
explain changes in 
the moon 
● The moon orbits or 
moves around the 
Earth. As it does this, 
its shape appears to 
change because the sun 
shines on and off one 
side of the moon.. This 
is why the moon 
appears to have 
different shapes at 
different times of the 
month. These shapes 
are called the phases of 
the moon. 
● Some phases of the 
moon are: 
new moon - the moon 
is between the Earth 
and sun. We cannot see 
the Moon at all. 
first-quarter moon - 
after a week, the moon 
orbits one quarter of the

 
Heat energy can be 
used for a number 
of things including 
cooking, ironing, 
baking and 
changing water into 
steam. 
 
People use air in many 
ways. Moving air is 
wind. Wind energy can 
be changed into 
electricity. A windmill 
or wind turbine does 
this. People use air to 
make things fly (e.g. a 
kite, airplane and hot air 
balloon). 
1c. Make a simple Pinwheel 
Step #1: 
Take your piece of paper and 
cut it into a perfect square. An 
easy way to do this is fold 
the paper into a triangle, 
taking one corner and lining 
it up to the other side. This 
will leave excess on one side 
that, once cut, gives you a 
square. 
Step #2: 
Fold the paper diagonally so it 
turns into a triangle and crease 
it lightly. Repeat this for the 
opposite direction as 
well. You will then unfold 
and have a creased "X" on 
the 
page.

Demonstration: How to 
Make  “Glass” 
Gather the following 
materials: 
– 1 cup sugar 
– a hot plate and pot 
– pane of tempered glass 
– 1/4 cup water 
Explain to students that although 
sugar isn’t really used to make 
glass, they can make a kind of glass 
out of sugar to get an idea of how 
sand is used to make real glass. 
Heat the water to boiling and stir in 
the sugar until it dissolves. Pour the 
mixture over the pane of glass and 
allow it to cool (about 15 minutes). 
Have students look through the 
“sugar glass.” If allowed to sit 
overnight, the “sugar glass” will 
become frosted.

Infer ways we use 
the sun and wind 
in the Bahamas 
The sun provides light and 
heat energy. We use light to 
see. Heat energy can be used 
for cooking, ironing, and 
baking. 
People use air to make things 
such as airplanes and hot air 
balloon fly. 
The Bahamas has a warm 
climate which make the sun 
and wind easy to use. Using 
the sun and wind for energy 
does not pollute the air. The 
way we get energy to our 
homes now pollutes the air.

Examine ways 
that people can 
harm habitats. 
The actions of humans can 
affect the places where 
plants and animals live. 
Sometimes our actions can 
destroy some habitats. For 
example, throwing litter on 
the ground. 
We waste natural resources 
in many ways in our homes 
by using more than we need 
or by using them 
unnecessarily. When we 
waste natural resources, we 
must get more from the 
environment, which costs 
money and uses up natural 
resources that we could run 
out of. 
When we use products and 
throw them away, we 
produce lots of trash and 
pollution in the 
environment.

Wasting natural resources 
is not good for the 
environment. 
Resources such as ground 
water can be depleted. 
Because The Bahamas has 
no rivers, most of its water 
for our homes come from 
the ground. Salt water can 
be changed into fresh 
usable water, but it is very 
expensive. In the Bahamas 
the usable fresh water sits 
on top of the saltwater in 
the ground. If we waste 
water, we will use up all of 
fresh water supply. 
They should provide tips on things 
that they should not do. 
"Closed Classroom" Experiment. 
Tell students that for the next week, 
the trash in their classroom will not 
be emptied. (You may have to get 
the cooperation of the custodian to 
do this, and you may have to get 
more trash cans.) Tell students that 
they are going to have to be careful 
about what they throw away. 
Explain that at the end of the week, 
they'll check to see how much trash 
they have and if anything didn't 
need to be thrown away. 
Conduct a Litter Experiment. 
Before students enter the classroom, 
scatter various litter items around 
the room. Do not mention the litter. 
Watch students' reactions and 
behaviours. Eventually, ask students 
how they feel about having their 
environment littered. Discuss the 
problems litter can cause.

 The main parts of a plant are the 
roots, stem, leaves and flower. 
 Each part of a plant has its own 
function (job to do). 
 Roots hold the plant in place and 
help to keep the soil from 
washing away. 
 They also take in water and 
minerals from the soil for the 
plant. 
 Some plants store food in their 
roots. 
 Carrots, potatoes, yams, beets 
and cassavas are examples of 
this. 
 Stems support the plant and 
transport materials between the 
roots and leaves. 
 They hold out the branches and 
leaves to catch the sunlight.

that occur at 
each phase of 
the water cycle. 
 The movement of water from Earth’s 
surface into the air and back to the 
surface again is called the water cycle. 
 The first step in the water cycle is 
evaporation. Evaporation is the 
changing of a liquid into a gas. 
 When the sun heats water liquid water 
changes into a gas - water vapor - 
and  rises into the air. 
 The second step in the water cycle is 
condensation.

 When the water vapor reaches cooler 
air it condenses, which means it 
changes from a gas to a liquid. This 
forms clouds. 
 Make 
inferences and

 The drops of water in the clouds join 
up until they are too heavy to float. 
 Then they fall to the ground 
precipitation (rain, snow, hail or 
sleet). 
 Because the cycle keeps repeating 
itself, water is always being recycled.

1. Interpret 
visuals to 
describe what 
causes seasons. 
 Earth has seasons because its axis is 
tilted. 
 This means Earth is tipped to one 
side. 
 The tilt change the way the sunlight 
hits Earth at different times of the 
year. 
 This changes the amount of light 
and heat Earth’s surface gets. 
 For part of the year the top of the 
axis (North Pole) points in the 
direction of the sun. This is summer 
in the northern half. 
 During that time the bottom of the 
axis (South Pole) points away from 
the sun. 
 Engage in 
collaborative 
studies 
 Communicate 
information 
effectively 
 Make 
inferences 
and draw

 Matter is anything that has 
mass and takes up space. 
 Matter has three different 
forms called states. 
 The three states of matter are 
solid, liquid, and gas. 
 A solid takes up space and 
has a definite shape. It does 
not lose its shape. 
 Liquids have volume that 
stays the same, but it can 
change its shape. A liquid 
takes the shape of its 
container. 
 A gas does not have a 
definite shape. It takes the 
shape of the container. It fills 
empty spaces. A gas does not 
have a definite volume.

A vector is any animal that may 
cause and transmit disease. 
In the Bahamas common vectors 
include the following: 
Fleas - Flea bites may cause 
discomfort and an allergic reaction in 
some people. 
Locally, the cat flea is the most 
important flea pest to humans and 
many domestic animals like cats and 
dogs. In other parts of the world, 
plague can be found in wild rodents 
like chipmunks and ground squirrels. 
Houseflies - The common housefly 
is one of the most widely distributed 
insects and has the ability to transmit 
disease to people. Houseflies are 
commonly found in homes and 
restaurants. Because of its close 
association with people and its 
ability to transmit disease, it is 
considered a great threat to humans.

They can carry more than 1 million kinds 
of bacteria on their bodies and can transfer 
these to contaminate surfaces and 
food. The common housefly can transmit 
the pathogens that cause shigellosis, 
typhoid fever, E. coli. and cholera. 
Rats – There are two species of rats that 
commonly become a problem in and 
around homes: the roof rat (black rat) and 
the Norway rat (brown rat). Roof rats and 
Norway rats contaminate food and animal 
feed and may transmit Salmonellosis, 
Leptospirosis and other diseases. These 
diseases may be contracted when food or 
water is contaminated with rat faeces or 
urine and is ingested or contacted by 
humans. 
Rats also harbor ectoparasites such 
as fleas and mites which may come in 
contact with humans and domestic 
animals.

Ticks - Ticks are capable of transmitting 
a wide variety of protozoan, 
bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. 
Ticks may be carried by wild hogs and 
furry animals like dogs. Lyme disease is 
one tick-borne disease of great concern. 
Mosquitoes - Adult female mosquitoes 
may bite humans or other vertebrates, 
including pets, livestock and wildlife to 
obtain the blood required for egg 
development. 
Bites cause skin irritation and may 
become infected especially if the bite is 
scratched. 
Mosquitoes are known to transmit a wide 
range of pathogens, including viruses, 
and protozoans such as the parasite that 
causes malaria. They are known to 
transmit diseases like West Nile, Zika, 
Dengue Fever and Chikungunya.

Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant 
water. If there are lids, old tires and 
containers that may catch rainwater lying 
around your yard, they will provide a 
place within which mosquitoes may lay 
their eggs, grow, and develop through 
their water stages (egg, larval and pupal). 
When mosquitoes meet their needs of 
water, food, and warmth, there will be a 
metamorphosis as they transform from 
larvae into pupae and pupae into adults. 
Larvae get oxygen from the surface. 
They suck in food like an underwater 
vacuum cleaner. They need warmth to 
develop into pupae. Both male and 
female feed mainly on fruit and plant 
nectar, but the female also needs the 
protein in blood to help her eggs 
develop. 
Observation: 
If there are mosquito larva 
present around your 
school, you may let 
students collect samples in 
glass or plastic jars and 
observe using hand lenses 
and microscopes.

Once she's had her fill of blood, she'll rest a 
couple of days before laying her eggs. 
After the airborne portion of their life cycle, 
females return to water to lay a new batch of 
fertile eggs. 
There are over 3,500 mosquito species 
worldwide. Mosquitos carry and spread disease 
to humans and cause millions of deaths every 
year. Only female mosquitoes bite people. 
To protect yourself and prevent mosquito bites 
you should do the following: 
 Empty any freestanding water since it is an 
ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. 
 Wear protective clothing such as long 
sleeves and pants when outdoors in 
mosquito prone areas. 
 Use mosquito nets in and outside areas. 
 Use citronella candles or insect repellent. 
 Use mosquito traps in outdoor areas.

Pollution is any unwanted matter that can 
be added to air, water or soil. When 
harmful materials are dumped into the 
water, this causes water pollution. 
Garbage littered on the land may be 
carried into the sea by rain and wind. 
Pollution makes water and lands unsafe 
for humans and other animals. Chemical 
fertilizers also pollute land and 
contaminate water resources. You can 
keep the water and land clean by not 
dumping. People can make less trash by: 
Reducing – this is really the best way to 
reduce your overall waste footprint. If 
you never buy, use or have, then you will 
not have the waste to manage when 
done. Individuals average about 4.3 
pounds of waste per day and we can all 
do something to reduce this amount. 
Buying durable products that will last 
longer, planning your purchases and 
cutting back, can help reduce waste.

Reusing - finding uses for items 
versus discarding them into the 
landfill. When possible, we should 
only buy items that can be reused (for 
example reusable shopping bags to 
replace plastic bags). We should 
maintain and  repair what we own, 
donate and give away items before 
you throw them away. 
Upcycling - making a creative or 
useful product from stuff that would 
have ordinarily been thrown away. We 
can find ways to repurpose items by 
finding alternative use for items that no 
longer serve their original purpose. 
Recycling - helps reduce pollution. 
Recycling is the process of converting 
garbage to raw materials and making 
them into new products. Recycling can 
help conserve resources. If aluminum 
is recycled, less bauxite, needs to be 
mined.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method 
❖ 
Cooperative Learning Technique

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
 Provide guidance for the students. 


 
  
 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

SCIENCE PROCESS 
Source: The American Association for the Advancement of Science 
 
BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps:

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere.

DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and 
teachers. As the internet is constantly changing, some websites may become non-functional, outdated or unsuitable.

An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic.

VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.
