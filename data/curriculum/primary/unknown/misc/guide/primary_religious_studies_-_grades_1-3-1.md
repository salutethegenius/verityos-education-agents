PREFACE 
 
 
 
In the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the predominant religion practiced is Christianity.  The Preamble to the Bahamian Constitution indicates that the 
preservation of our nation’s freedom is predicated upon a “national commitment to self-discipline, industry, loyalty, unity and an abiding respect for Christian 
values.” Therefore, the Religious Studies Curriculum, at the elementary level, is based entirely on Judeo-Christian teachings and principles.   
 
Religious Studies is a core subject at the elementary level and must be taught as a separate subject or as a part of the integrative process.  The Curriculum is 
based on four strands:  Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and Celebrations/Festivals.  Through these broad strands, key 
concepts, values, attitudes and skills are integrated from Grade One to Grade Six.   
 
In this revised document, there is a greater emphasis on the development of skills that students will need to live successfully as national and global citizens.  
Furthermore, grade level standards and benchmarks are clearly outlined in order to consistently monitor student progress and performance.  The curriculum is 
rigorous but it is designed for flexibility and to encourage creativity.

RATIONALE 
 
Throughout our ever-changing world, there is a basic longing for human beings to connect with the spiritual side of their existence.  Even very young children 
express a natural curiosity about their existence and purpose. This curiosity leads to a search to find answers to fundamental questions such as:  Why am I here?  
Why do people suffer? What happens after death?  Religion serves the purpose of connecting human beings with their Creator, enabling them to explore answers 
to some of life’s mysteries.  
 
Religious Studies affords learners opportunities to explore religious beliefs and practices and how they impact individuals and the society.  It enables them to 
consider and respond to fundamental questions about their purpose in life.  It promotes the development of values and morals, enabling students to make informed 
decisions on moral and ethical issues.  Moreover, Religious Studies provides opportunities for students to demonstrate respect for other people, their opinions and 
beliefs. 
 
The aim of Religious Studies, therefore, is to help students develop skills for lifelong learning, enabling them to become productive citizens and stewards of the 
Earth. The Christian beliefs and values that are esteemed in this society will be transmitted to our students, providing them with a foundation on which they can 
develop good character, strengthen social relationships and build strong communities.  Ultimately, students will be equipped with the necessary skills, values and 
attitudes for life and work in the 21st century. 
 
The Religious Studies Curriculum supports the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (2015-2030) which promote equality for all, protection of our 
natural resources and peaceful societies.

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies should be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.   
 
 
The following example indicates how the curriculum objectives are number:

The Bible tells us that 
through faith individuals can

The Bible teaches us what is 
right and what is wrong. In the 
Old Testament, God gave the 
Israelites or the Jews, rules or 
laws 
called 
the 
Ten 
Commandments.  These laws 
are found in Exodus Chapter 
20.  It is right to worship God, 
honour 
our 
parents 
and 
respect others.  It is wrong to 
worship idols or false gods, tell 
lies, kill someone and steal.  
 
Other scriptures also teach us 
to do what is right such as:  
Eph. 6:1-2; 1 John 4:7-8; Eph. 
4:32

Because God is holy, it is only 
fitting 
that 
He 
should

reverenced. Christians show 
reverence to God by bowing 
down and worshiping Him, 
singing songs of praise to Him 
and by avoiding distractions 
during prayer. Reverence is 
also shown in the way the Bible 
and other sacred objects are 
handled. We place God far 
above everything because He 
has 
revealed 
Himself 
to 
mankind through His creation, 
His Word (The Bible) and

God created human beings with 
the unique ability to think and

said, “Let us make man in our 
image and likeness.” Humans 
are the only animals created 
with a mind to think and

what prayer is 
 
Prayer is communicating with 
God 
which 
includes 
both 
talking and listening to God.  
Jeremiah 29:12 tells us that 
when we pray God listens.  
God speaks to our heart when 
we pray.  If we listen, we will 
hear His still voice. 
 
 In the Bible, Hannah prayed to 
God for a child. God heard 
Hannah’s prayer and blessed 
her 
with 
a 
son, 
Samuel. 
Samuel grew to serve the Lord.

that the family is 
the main part of 
any society  
 
The family is the building block of any 
society. Families play an important 
role because they are the first to 
educate their children. They also instil 
morals and values in them to help 
them become responsible citizens 
and adults in society. Our values 
teach us how to treat other people,

Each member in the family is 
important. Everyone should 
ensure that their role in the 
family is carried out to make the 
load lighter. The parents are 
caretakers and are important in 
a family.  Children depend on 
them emotionally to show them 
love, to take care of them and 
to provide for them. Children 
are important because they 
can 
assist 
parents 
by 
completing chores around the 
home. One day, children will 
become adults who will also 
need to know how to function 
and contribute to society.

3.1. B.3.1. Relate 
what a community is 
 
A community is a place where diverse groups 
of people live and work together. In a 
community you can find buildings such as 
houses, churches, libraries, clinics, police 
stations, shops and schools.  All communities 
have roads and some may have parks. There 
are many individuals who work in a 
community such as cashiers, librarians, 
nurses, doctors, police officers and teachers.

or 
religions they must work together. People in a 
community work together to keep the 
community clean. Sometimes they form a 
“Neighbourhood Watch” group to help keep 
the community safe. They support each other 
through businesses.  Churches often partner 
with schools by donating funds and offering 
assistance where needed.

Consequences are the result of

and 
bad 
consequences. 
However, 
they 
both teach us how to exhibit better 
behaviour.  When we do what is 
right, we are rewarded with good 
consequences. For example if you 
found money lying on the floor in 
our classroom and take it to the 
teacher so that he/she can find the 
rightful owner, you may be given 
praise or even a treat for doing the 
right thing. When we exhibit bad 
actions the consequences for our 
actions will also be bad. For 
example, if you did not study and 
got a low grade the consequence 
may be that your parents may not 
allow you to use your tablet for a 
week.

Christian 
celebrations/festivals 
have 
helped 
shaped our culture in many ways.  The Christmas 
festival has created cultural practices such as 
going to church, gift-giving, decorating homes, 
shopping and spending time with family members. 
Special foods are eaten like, ham, turkey and 
peas n’ rice.  
 
The Easter season has also impacted our culture.  
Easter is a time of reflection and self-sacrifice.  On 
Good Friday, many Bahamians attend church, 
eat hot cross buns and fried fish, to remember 
Jesus’ death.  On Easter Sunday, we attend 
church dressed in bright colours to symbolize the 
new life of our resurrected Saviour. 
 
Cultural practices related to Pentecost include 
celebrating Pentecost Sunday, and wearing white 
to represent the purity of the Holy Spirit.  Whit
