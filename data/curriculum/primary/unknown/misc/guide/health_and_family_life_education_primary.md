MESSAGE FROM THE MINISTER 
 
“The curriculum is the reason there are schools. 
Everything else…schedules, budgets, 
vision statements…is just support.” 
                                                                                                                                                              Mary Brady – The Real Basics 
 
I have always believed in the transformative power of education, particularly in a developing country, and I strongly support the government’s commitment to the 
orderly growth and sustainable development in education.  Indeed, because of the role of the curriculum in the provision of quality education, I am honoured to sanction 
and present revised national curricula in several disciplines.  This curriculum revision exercise has been an ongoing, successful collaborative effort.  Each curriculum 
was developed by a team of intelligent, innovative and hard working education officers who received invaluable input from teachers, students, parents and community 
partners. 
 
In keeping with the changing demands of higher education, life and work in the twenty first century revised curricula have moved away from a content-based and 
knowledge-focused approach.  The new documents focus on higher – order thinking skills, cross curricula understanding, collaboration, creativity and real world 
problem solving.  Subject specialists and curriculum writers have included those activities which take into account the diverse learning styles of students and their 
various ability levels. 
 
Classroom teachers will be responsible for implementing these curricula that subscribe to the philosophy that all children can learn and perform best when they actively 
construct knowledge and understanding.  I am particularly pleased that at each grade level there are clear processes and procedures which allow teachers to align 
instructional strategies and classroom-based assessments to agreed international standards and benchmarks. 
- 
Our public and private sector stakeholders in education have approved our curriculum design which ensures that goals, objectives, skills and teaching – learning 
strategies represent high level expectations for student performance.  To be successful in today’s society, students at every level of schooling must be encouraged and 
supported by all teachers, administrators, parents and other education partners. 
 
The publication, dissemination and successful implementation of these curriculum guidelines will further unite us in our efforts to create people of character who are 
committed to life-long learning and who are always willing to serve. 
 
 To the classroom teachers and subject specialists, who are devoted to transforming the lives of students throughout The Bahamas, thank you for your continued 
contribution to our country!

Minister of Education, Science and Technology

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip 
them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They are 
respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as that state of well-
being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human development. 
This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration with Government 
Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will include sensitization and training 
for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit will 
coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, substance abuse 
prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be conducted to 
address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles through 
training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. Life is the most valuable, natural possession to be nurtured and protected at all times by everyone. 
 
2. The stabilization of family is the key to the management of most of the social problems. 
 
3. Health is essential to the well-being of all individuals. 
 
4. Academic achievement and student health and well-being are inextricably linked. 
 
5. HFLE, with its emphasis on prevention and multi-disciplinary approaches, has the potential to address many of the social problems and impact 
behaviors and lifestyles. 
 
6. HFLE aims to address the whole child and to nurture emotional, physical, mental and moral development. It takes into account both affective and 
cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome. 
 
8. HFLE is the means by which positive values, attitudes and behaviors, knowledge and skills can be taught. The core skills, which the young 
develop within HFLE, can be translated into all areas of their lives. 
 
9. HFLE creates an atmosphere of trust, openness, sincerity and honesty, which contributes to positive interpersonal relationships. 
 
10. HFLE draws heavily on the experiences of students and educators and deals with young people in the context of home, school and community 
relationships.  
 
11. HFLE produces individuals who, cognizant of their roles in society, will make a positive contribution to national, regional and international 
development.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in learning, 
the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the development of individuals 
and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many important social, cultural and health issues 
in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown that confident, well-informed and well-supported 
young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the lifelong 
acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In order for 
individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address issues and 
risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 
HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse and drug dealing, negative 
sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, Sexuality 
and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is interrelated and has been 
developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary methods. 
Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of accurate knowledge, skills development and exploration of values and attitudes. Health and Family Life classes 
afford students opportunities to build competencies for healthy self-development to deal with the challenges of life as well as make positive contributions 
to national, regional and international development. 
 
Finally, the activities and ideas presented in this document are not exhaustive.  You may be able to find many more to match the lesson topics and the 
specific objectives.  Please feel free to do this and share your ideas with other teachers for the enrichment of the programme and the development of our 
children.

(different) include:  
- colour of hair, skin or eyes 
- height 
- body size 
- sex (male, female) 
- disabilities e.g. blindness, deformity, deafness,  
  etc.  
 
People should be treated with respect and tolerance 
regardless of their individual differences.

body parts. These parts help them to function.  
 
External body parts include: head, face, lips, neck, eyes, 
ears, mouth, nose, arms, breasts, hands, fingers, legs, feet, 
toes, skin, vulva and vagina (girls), scrotum and penis 
(boys).   
 
Internal body parts include: lungs, heart, brain, kidney, 
stomach, tongue, bone, intestines, bladder, etc.   
 
Each body part has a special function e.g. the eyes see, ears 
are for hearing, nose is for smelling, feet are for walking, 
tongue is for tasting, etc. 
 
Human beings are made up of body, mind and spirit or 
social, mental and physical. To be healthy we need balance 
in our physical, mental, spiritual and social life.

The body is special, valuable and unique. (Review 
Body Parts in Standard 2.1) 
 
The parts of the body covered by a swimming suit are 
the parts that are always private. Any touching on 
those parts of the body, any secret touching, or any 
touching that makes you feel uncomfortable, worried 
or upset should be reported to an adult you trust.   
 
Good or safe touches are healthy and make you feel 
safe and comfortable e.g. pat on the back, hugs, etc. 
These are ways to show love, support, affection and 
friendship.   
 
Bad or unsafe touches make you feel confused, 
frightened or uncomfortable. This type of touching 
includes: kissing, and touching  or fondling private 
parts, pushing, shoving, hitting, etc.  
Level 1: Draw a picture (a) demonstrating a “good” touch that 
shows caring and kindness. b) showing the parts of the body 
not to be touched by strangers.

- Inappropriate or overly friendly behaviour  
- Special interest or attention given to one child above others e.g. gift 
giving 
-Telling secrets 
- Threats to the individual or family members  
 
Sometimes, it is okay for others to touch private parts e.g. parents, 
doctors or nurses sometimes need to touch private parts when they take 
care of you or examine you for health reasons.  
 
Most touching done by adults is good touching, but children need to 
know what to do when someone touches private parts inappropriately. 
. Children should not keep ‘inappropriate touching’ secret. 
Safety Tips: Say No, Go and Tell 
• Say NO! 
• Get Away 
• Tell an Adult

Germs are tiny organisms or living things that are found 
everywhere, in all kinds of places. Some germs are helpful to 
the body and some are harmful.  
 
There are four major types of germs: bacteria, viruses, fungi, 
and parasites. They can invade plants, animals, and people, and 
sometimes they make them sick or cause diseases.  
 
Germs are spread in the air, through body fluids (saliva, blood, 
etc), by insets (mosquitoes, flies, ticks)  
 
The very smallest germs are called viruses which cause 
common diseases such as cold, flu, measles and chicken pox.

EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
The environment is made up of living and non-living things. 
  
Living things in the environment include: plants, animals and people. 
 
Non-living things in the environment are water, air, land, sunlight, 
man-made products (roads, buildings, places where people live, work, 
shop, exercise and play). 
 
Benefits of the Living Environment  
- Magnificent species the earth has to offer 
- Animals provide food, clothes, shelter, companionship and 
transportation  
- Wood from trees is used to make many different things  
- Plants take carbon dioxide out of the air and produce oxygen. This 
enables us to have oxygen to breathe and reduces the effect of carbon 
dioxide which has been blamed for global warming as it traps the heat 
from the sun in that atmosphere. 
- Forest, trees and other natural ecosystems reduce the risk of 
catastrophic climate change impacts like floods and droughts

Pathogens cause diseases only if they grow and multiply in the 
body. (Review Grade 2, Standard 2.3: How Communicable 
Diseases are Spread).  
 
Immunizations are given to protect people for communicable 
diseases such as meningitis, mumps, measles, rubella and polio. 
Everyone needs these vaccines in order to stay healthy

TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices, and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, values and 
attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. However, 
teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit grades which will 
contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. (sharing 
thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills) 
• Field trips 
• Internships 
• Community Services 
 
Assessment Procedures 
 
Students are assessed based on the following: 
 
Class work and Homework   
60% 
 
Projects and Portfolios  
 
40% 


 
75 
Health and Family Life Education Resource / Information Centre 
 
Each classroom should have a resource or information centre in which information on health issues and students’ work are displayed. Health and Family 
Life materials and activities can also be incorporated into the learning centres in primary schools. 
 
Listed are some suggested resources that will make Health and Family Life Education classes more interactive and interesting: 
 
• Computer Software 
• Transparencies on health issues   
• Games and Puzzles  
• Reality dolls 
• Puppets 
• Posters / Charts 
• Videos, DVDs and Audio Cassette tapes on health issues 
• Pamphlets  
• Brochures  
• Guest Speakers  
• Media sources  
 
Health and Family Life Education Services 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit provides the following services in New Providence and the Family Islands. 
 
• Workshop and sensitization sessions for teachers, parents, students and the public 
• Resources on health issues 
• Peer leadership training 
• HIV Prevention and Basic First Aid training  
 
Partnerships 
 
The Health and Family Education Unit collaborates with parents, school personnel, Government and Non-Government organizations to provide 
wholesome programmes for students. These activities are designed to help them gain the required knowledge, skills, values and attitudes so that they will 
graduate from the education system as fully functioning, self-confident, responsible individuals.

APPENDIX III 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will be time 
for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, role play, 
games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication, 
negotiation, assertiveness and cooperation. 
 
12. Ensure that grades are recorded in the mark book for the topics taught (date, topic, and number grade) 
 
13. Establish interactive learning centres in the classroom which should include current teaching aids and samples of students’ activities.  
 
14. Create instructional and motivational bulletin boards/charts that reflect the concepts and skills being taught e.g. family patterns, body parts, hygiene, 
drug abuse prevention, conflict resolution, HIV, AIDS STIs,  nutrition, environment issues, self-esteem, teamwork, etc.

TEACHING GOOD VALUES AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP 
 
 
Dr. Marian Bock, Director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle’s Virtues Project, defines virtues as universal positive character traits. She defines 
values as agreements, rules, principles, codes and beliefs about how to practice these virtues. Bock recommends integrating fifty-two universal virtues 
into appropriate family life classes by encouraging students to recognize them in themselves and others.

MESSAGE FROM THE MINISTER 
 
“The curriculum is the reason there are schools. 
Everything else…schedules, budgets, 
vision statements…is just support.” 
                                                                                                                                                              Mary Brady – The Real Basics 
 
I have always believed in the transformative power of education, particularly in a developing country, and I strongly support the government’s commitment 
to the orderly growth and sustainable development in education.  Indeed, because of the role of the curriculum in the provision of quality education, I am 
honoured to sanction and present revised national curricula in several disciplines.  This curriculum revision exercise has been an ongoing, successful 
collaborative effort.  Each curriculum was developed by a team of intelligent, innovative and hard working education officers who received invaluable input 
from teachers, students, parents and community partners. 
 
In keeping with the changing demands of higher education, life and work in the twenty first century revised curricula have moved away from a content-
based and knowledge-focused approach.  The new documents focus on higher – order thinking skills, cross curricula understanding, collaboration, creativity 
and real world problem solving.  Subject specialists and curriculum writers have included those activities which take into account the diverse learning styles 
of students and their various ability levels. 
 
Classroom teachers will be responsible for implementing these curricula that subscribe to the philosophy that all children can learn and perform best when 
they actively construct knowledge and understanding.  I am particularly pleased that at each grade level there are clear processes and procedures which 
allow teachers to align instructional strategies and classroom-based assessments to agreed international standards and benchmarks. 
- 
Our public and private sector stakeholders in education have approved our curriculum design which ensures that goals, objectives, skills and teaching – 
learning strategies represent high level expectations for student performance.  To be successful in today’s society, students at every level of schooling must 
be encouraged and supported by all teachers, administrators, parents and other education partners. 
 
The publication, dissemination and successful implementation of these curriculum guidelines will further unite us in our efforts to create people of character 
who are committed to life-long learning and who are always willing to serve. 
 
 To the classroom teachers and subject specialists, who are devoted to transforming the lives of students throughout The Bahamas, thank you for your 
continued contribution to our country! 
 
 
Hon. Jerome K. Fitzgerald  
Minister of Education, Science and Technology  
September, 2012

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that 
will equip them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by 
Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They 
are respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as 
that state of well-being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of 
all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human 
development. This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration 
with Government Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will 
include sensitization and training for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit 
will coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, 
substance abuse prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage 
pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be 
conducted to address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles 
through training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

3. Health is essential to the well-being of all individuals. 
 
4. Academic achievement and student health and well-being are inextricably linked. 
 
5. HFLE, with its emphasis on prevention and multi-disciplinary approaches, has the potential to address many of the social problems and 
impact behaviors and lifestyles. 
 
6. HFLE aims to address the whole child and to nurture emotional, physical, mental and moral development. It takes into account both 
affective and cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome. 
 
8. HFLE is the means by which positive values, attitudes and behaviors, knowledge and skills can be taught. The core skills, which the 
young develop within HFLE, can be translated into all areas of their lives. 
 
9. HFLE creates an atmosphere of trust, openness, sincerity and honesty, which contributes to positive interpersonal relationships.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in 
learning, the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the 
development of individuals and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many 
important social, cultural and health issues in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown 
that confident, well-informed and well-supported young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the 
lifelong acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In 
order for individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address 
issues and risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs), HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse 
and drug dealing, negative sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, 
Sexuality and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is 
interrelated and has been developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary 
methods. Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of accurate knowledge, skills development and exploration of values and attitudes. Health and 
Family Life classes afford students opportunities to build competencies for healthy self-development to deal with the challenges of life as well 
as make positive contributions to national, regional and international development. 
 
Finally, the activities and ideas presented in this document are not exhaustive.  You may be able to find many more to match the lesson topics 
and the specific objectives.  Please feel free to do this and share your ideas with other teachers for the enrichment of the programme and the 
development of our children.

Traits are the physical characteristics or 
qualities (mental, emotional and social) 
that make a person special. 
 
Traits can be inherited and acquired. 
Inherited traits are passed on to individuals 
from their parents e.g. the ability to play a 
musical instrument, being great in sports, 
being good in a foreign language, etc.  
 
Acquired traits are characteristics that 
people develop as a result of life 
experiences and engaging in activities over 
time. One might become a skilled player 
because they acquired an interest in the 
activity and practiced until they perfected 
it.  
 
Individual interests, skills and talents make 
a person unique or different from others.  
Complete a self-inventory identifying their interests and 
hobbies. Share findings with the class. 
Level 1: Collect pictures of their interests and hobbies

EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
A disability is a mental or physical condition that prevents the 
body from working, as it should.  
 
People have different forms of disabilities. 
- Physical disabilities include: blindness, deafness, speech 
defects, paralysis (cripple), etc. 
- Emotional disturbances and mental retardation are forms of 
mental disabilities.  
 
A disability is not a disease that can be spread to another 
person.   
 
People who have disabilities want to be treated with respect, 
care and understanding. 
 
They also want to be independent and do as much for 
themselves as they can. 
 
Good citizens see disabilities as opportunities to learn more 
about people and their challenges. 
Level 1: Compile a list of ways they 
can show respect toward others. Share 
their lists with classmates.  
 
Level 2: Create posters promoting 
ways to be more caring to people who 
are different from them.  
 
Level 3: Interview someone in the 
school or community who is disabled.  
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
Have students portray a disabled 
person for a class period or a day. Let 
them write about their experience and 
list recommendations to make their 
school communities more accessible 
for disabled persons.

Using illegal drugs can prevent you from doing well in school and 
sports.  They can stop you from caring about family, friends and 
important things.  These actions hurt everybody around you

Protection from abuse  
Any form of abuse is against the law and should be reported.  
 
Article 34 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child provides protection from any form of sexual abuse.   
 
It is important to report sexual abuse to a trusted adult. 
Always say ‘NO’, get away and seek help.  Reporting these 
abuses also raises awareness about pedophiles in the 
community. 
 
Sometimes, it is okay for others to touch private parts e.g. 
parents, doctors or nurses sometimes need to touch private 
parts when they take care of you or examine you for health 
reasons.  
 
Most touching done by adults is good touching, but children 
need to know what to do when someone touches private 
parts inappropriately. Children should not keep 
‘inappropriate touching’ secret. 
Level 1. Create a slogan, bumper 
sticker or flyer to demonstrate

TEACHING AND  
EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
A sexually transmitted infection (STI), also know as sexually transmitted 
disease or venereal disease (VD) is an infection that is spread through sexual 
contact. Anyone who has sexual contact with another person is at risk of 
getting an STI. 
 
Some common STIs are: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis (Bad Blood), 
Genital Herpes, Hepatitis B and HIV.  
 
Many STIs can be cured with medicines; some have no cure. Genital Herpes 
and HIV do not have a cure. Treatment for Genital Herpes with an antiviral 
drug makes outbreaks less severe. Drug treatment for HIV improves the 
quality of life and survival time for patients. 
 
Common Symptoms of STIs 
- Sore, blisters or swelling around the penis or vagina 
- A burning feeling when passing urine 
- Unusual liquid comes out of the vagina or penis. It is sometimes smelly  
 
A person can have an STI and not notice any signs. You cannot tell who has 
an STI or HIV by looking at them. 
Level 1: Describe how 
STIs are spread and list 
some symptoms and 
treatment. 
 
Level 2: Research some 
common STIs and list the 
causes, symptoms, effects 
and treatment.

Choosing foods that contain nutrients and in the right 
proportions is important to maintaining good health and 
preventing diseases.  
 
Special Nutrients (Micronutrients) 
Minierals such as vitamins, minerals and water are classified as 
micronutrients nutrients because they are needed in small 
amounts in the body. 
 
Vitamins are nutrients that help the body do certain jobs.  
- Vitamin A prevents infection, keeps the eyes moist and the 
hair and skin shiny  
- Vitamin C prevents infection, keeps the skin healthy and 
heals wounds. It also helps the body absorb iron.  
- Vitamin D keeps bones and teeth strong. This vitamin is also 
produced by the sun. 
- Vitamin E slows down cell damage 
- Vitamin K controlls blood clotting 
Level 1: Identify special nutrients that 
the body needs for good health.

function  
- Potasium helps nerves and muscles function and helps cells use 
energy 
- Zinc helps the body grow, heals wounds and maintains the senses 
of smell and taste

 EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
The Food Guide Drum and Dietary Guidelines reflect both 
the culture and food choices relevant to The Bahamas *  
 
The Dietary Guidelines show how many servings an 
individual should eat from each food group each day.  
 
A serving is a standard amount food recommended for a 
meal or snack.  It is used to give advice about how much 
to eat or to identify how many calories and nutrients are in 
a food.  
 
A portion is the amount of food an individual chooses to 
eat. There is no standard portion size. A portion may 
contain more than one serving.   
 
It is important to control portion sizes to maintain a 
healthy and balanced diet. Always use serving sizes as a 
guide when selecting foods.  
Level 1: Explain the difference between 
food servings and portion size.  
 
Level 2: Explain why it is important to 
control portion size.  
 
Level 3: Conduct a survey of the portion 
size served by the school lunch 
programme.  
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
Have students demonstrate the correct 
serving size for various food items.  
 
Organize foods from each of the food 
groups to create a balanced meal for 
breakfast, lunch or dinner.

All human beings grow and develop in a given sequence 
but at different rates.  
 
Puberty is the period during adolescence when the body 
begins to develop and change.  Puberty usually starts 
between ages 8 and 13 in girls and 10 and 15 in boys.  
Everyone begins puberty at his or her own pace.  
 
During puberty, male and female hormones are released 
into the blood stream. Hormones are chemicals that 
cause body growth and physical, emotional and mental 
changes. 
 
Physical Changes and Development:   
Physical changes during puberty affect the way the body 
looks. These changes can be dramatic and disturbing   
- Oily skin/acne 
- Sudden growth  
- Sometimes clumsy   
- Increased perspiration and body odor  
Level 1:  List the changes that occur in 
boys and girls during puberty.  
 
Level 2: (a) Label where changes occur 
on male and female diagrams. (b) Create 
a personal checklist of the changes 
expected to occur as a result of puberty. 
 
Level 3: (a) Create a Venn diagram that 
records the changes experienced by 
boys, by girls and by both. (b) Discuss 
why puberty begins at different times 
for each person. 
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
(a) Design a bookmark to help kids 
learn more about puberty;  
(b) Create a “How to care for yourself”

HIV is a virus which stands for (Human Immune-
deficiency Virus). When this virus attacks the immune 
system, it makes it weak and unable to protect against 
infections and diseases.  
 
HIV is different from most of the other communicable 
diseases because it is a STI and requires contact with 
body fluids such as blood, saliva, urine, etc. It has no 
cure, or vaccine to prevent it.  
 
Transmission of HIV: 
HIV is carried by body fluids such as blood, semen, 
vaginal fluids and breast milk of an infected person. It 
is generally passed on through:   
- Unprotected sexual intercourse;  
- Blood transfusion / Sharing needles; 
- An infected woman to her baby during birth, or 
through breast-feeding   
Level 1: Define terms related to 
HIV and AIDS.  
 
Level 2:  Identify ways in which 
HIV can be (a) transmitted (b) not 
transmitted.

Non-transmission of HIV:   
The HIV virus does not pass through the air. You can 
not get it from being in the same room with an infected 
person.  
You can not get it by touching or hugging, sharing 
pencils or hairbrushes or even food.   
The HIV virus causes AIDS which stands for Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  People with AIDS die 
from other diseases they get such as pneumonia and 
cancer. 
 
Prevention of HIV and AIDS:  
Make choices that keep you healthy  
- Abstain from sex until you are an adult or married  
- Never use drugs. They impair your judgment  
- Have one faithful sexual partner

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves balancing food intake 
with physical activity.  
 
Many diseases that lead to death are directly related to lifestyle 
choices e.g. poor eating or drinking habits, lack of exercise, drug 
use, etc.  
 
Persons who are overweight or obese (very fat) are at higher risk 
or more likely to develop life style diseases.   
 
Life style diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension 
(high blood pressure), cancer and AIDS are the leading causes of 
death in The Bahamas.  
 
These diseases can be prevented with  better life style choices: 
- Practice healthy eating by making healthy food choices 
- Exercise  regularly  
- Get enough sleep every night  
- Avoid using drugs such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, etc.

EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
Any natural event that causes widespread injury, death and property 
damage is known as a natural disaster e.g. hurricane, storm, tornado, 
flood, earthquake, and Tsunami.   
 
Every year hurricanes, storms, tornadoes and floods occur in The 
Bahamas. Knowing what to do during these natural disasters could 
mean the difference between life and death.  
 
A hurricane is a storm that forms over tropical areas of oceans and can 
move inland. In a hurricane, rain is heavy, and winds blow greater than 
75 miles per hour. 
 
A tropical storm also forms over tropical areas of oceans. Wind speeds 
vary between 40 and 75 miles per hour.  
 
A tornado is a violently rotating funnel-shaped column of air associated 
with a thunder storm. Signs such as dark greenish sky, large hail and a 
loud roar occur. Tornadoes can form quickly without warning.  
  
Hurricanes and thunder storms can cause major flooding especially in 
low-lying areas.  
Level 1: Identify the natural 
disasters that occur on their island.  
 
Level 2: Describe natural disasters 
and their effects on families and 
communities.

Aging is a part of the natural cycle of life. (Review Grade 
4, Standard 2.1: the Human Life Cycle). 
 
As people age, they may have to adjust to physical 
limitations (hearing loss, paralysis, blindness), mental 
dysfunction or social adjustment (loneliness, empty nest).  
 
People are worthy of love, care and respect no matter what 
their age or condition of health.  
 
Society can provide support and services for individuals as 
their physical, mental and emotional abilities decline with 
age. 
- Family members can provide support as caregiver, friend, 
adoption, etc.  
- Children and teens can find opportunities to become 
  involved in the lives of older adults e.g. volunteering at  
  senior citizens homes or daycare, advocating for 
  enforcement and changes to laws that protect the 
  rights of senior citizens.   
Level 1: Design a poster to discourage 
discrimination against older adults.    
 
Level 2: Discuss ways in which older 
members of society influence their lives e.g. 
what they do and how they live. 
 
Level 3: Collect newspaper and magazine 
articles about accomplishments of older 
adults and arrange them on a bulletin board 
for National Heroes Day (Discovery Day). 
 
Levels 1 – 3:   
Compile a list of the programmes and 
services that are available for older adults in 
their community e.g. Adopt a Grandparent 
or Senior Citizen.  Encourage students to

emotional and intellectual development). 
 
Practicing healthy habits contribute to wellness and promote a 
positive self- image. (Review Grade 5, Standard 1.4: Health 
habits that contribute to wellness)   
 
Products (hair and skin care) and services (doctor visits and 
dental check ups) are important in maintaining good health.  
 
When you decide to buy a health product, you must decide 
whether it has quality and is right for your needs. Carefully 
choosing hair and skin care products can help you avoid wasting 
money.  
 
Deciding which health products are best for you can sometimes 
be difficult. Using the steps for Making Responsible Decisions 
can help you make good choices that are right for your body.

In order to understand what sex is all about and how pregnancy 
occurs, it is important to know the functions of the male and female 
reproductive systems.  
 
Male Reproductive System   
The male sex organ is the penis.  Behind the penis is the scrotum, 
which is a skin sac that holds the two testicles (also known as testes) 
that make sperm and the male hormone, testosterone.  
 
Once a young man starts puberty, his body is able to make sperm.  
From this point on, he is able to get a female pregnant.  The sperm 
are made in the testes (testicles).  The testes also produce the male 
hormone, testosterone.   
 
After sperm are made, they travel through tubes in the epididymis, 
where they mature and are stored.  If the sperm are not ejaculated 
from the body, they will be reabsorbed.  During sexual arousal, the 
sperm travel through the vas deferens to the prostate, where fluid is 
added. The fluid plus sperm makes up semen.   
 
Level 1:  Define vocabulary 
words from the lesson  
 
Level 2:  List the parts and 
functions of the male and female 
reproduction systems  
 
Level 3: Outline the process 
leading to pregnancy 
(conception) 
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
(a) Design a bookmark to help 
students learn more about 
pregnancy prevention;  
(b) Create a “How to care for 
yourself” pamphlet.

Ejaculation is when this semen comes out of the penis 
through the urethra during sexual activity.  Only 
semen (no urine) is released during ejaculation. 
When a man becomes aroused, the penis fills with 
blood and stiffens.  This is known as an erection.  
During puberty, young men begin an erection while 
they sleep and release semen.  This often called a wet 
dream. The clinical name is Nocturnal Emission.  
 
Female Reproductive System   
The female reproductive system contains a uterus, 
ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, Clitoris, labia and 
vagina. 
 
The ovaries produce eggs and hormones called 
estrogen and progesterone.   
The fallopian tubes are connected to the uterus.    
The fallopian tubes pick up the eggs produced by the 
ovaries.   
Levels 1 – 3 cont’d:

(include the care of the mother before and

The uterus is a thick muscle and houses the baby before birth.   
The cervix is at the base of the uterus.  Its job is to hold the baby 
inside the uterus until the baby’s birth.   
The clitoris is located in front of the urethral opening and contains 
sensitive nerve endings.   
The labia are the skin folds around the urethral and vaginal openings 
The vagina is the tubular opening from the uterus to outside the body 
through which the baby travels when it is born.  The vagina is also 
where sperm from the penis are deposited during sexual intercourse. 
 
At puberty, the ovaries begin to release eggs and menstruation 
(monthly periods) starts. The uterus builds up its lining with extra 
blood and tissue to provide protection for a fertilized egg to grow into 
a healthy baby. 
 
If a sperm from the male does not fertilize the egg, it passes through 
the vagina along with the extra blood and tissue from the uterus as a 
menstruation period, which usually lasts from 5 to 7 days.

 Adolescence (the teenage years) is a time of change.  The body and 
the mind are maturing.  This is a normal part of growing up.   
 
Risk Behaviours in Adolescents:  
Risky behaviours include use of or experimenting with things such 
as alcohol, smoking, drugs, violence, and sex.   
 
Consequences of Risky Behaviours:  
Risky behaviours lead to serious consequences.   
- Addiction and dependency: Drugs and alcohol can inhibit a 
person’s ability to make good choices and people who normally 
would not engage in risky activities, end up doing so while under 
the influence 
- Promiscuity  
- Exposure to Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) including 
HIV 
- Exposure to risk of cancer of the cervix from having sex at an 
early age 
- Being pregnant or getting a female pregnant 
Level 1: List the reasons why 
students should abstain from 
risky behaviours.  
 
Level 2: Make a list of all the 
things you want to do with 
your life that are good reasons 
for refusing to take part in 
risky behaviours.  
 
Level 3: Interview a parent or

One of the basic human needs is food. Food is important to life.   
 
The kind of foods eaten and their nutritional value have direct effect on 
one’s health and well being. Therefore, it is important to eat healthy foods.   
 
Food choices are influenced by the following factors: 
- Location (Where people live)   
- Cultural patterns and social interaction: (traditions festivals, 
homecomings, family gatherings,  ) 
- Eating habits (bingeing, overeating, hunger)   
- Accessibility (Income, purchasing power) 
- Availability (local production, imports)  
- Advertisements   
- Food preparation (Fried, baked, jerked, boiled) 
 
No one food gives all the nutrients that the body needs to stay healthy, so it 
is best to eat a variety of different foods everyday.  
 
The foods that make up the daily food requirement should be low in fat and 
high in vitamins, minerals and fiber.  
Level 1: Identify the factors 
that influence an individual’s 
food choices.  
 
Level 2: Trace the changes 
in values and influences that 
affect food choices in their 
family.

different cultures  and 
investigate how these items 
are prepared.

meals everyday.    
- Make starchy vegetables, peas and beans part of the diet. 
- Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables everyday. 
- Limit the amount of high fat and greasy foods. To help achieve this, 
extra fat and skin on meat products should be trimmed and low fat 
cooking methods such as baking, roasting and broiling should be chosen.  
- Foods eaten should include: the correct serving from the food groups 
(a serving is the standard amount that is listed for each food and is used 
to help give advice about how much to eat or to identify how many 
calories and nutrients are in the food).  
 
Explain the nutritional needs of individuals based on age, sex, activity 
level and state of health.

Human beings are made up of different shapes and sizes. Body image 
includes the way people see themselves as well as the way they 
believe others view them.   
 
During adolescence, children become more concerned about their 
appearance. (Review puberty in Theme II Sexuality and Sexual 
Health)  
 
Factors that influence body image 
- Self-esteem and self-acceptance: Feeling good about self promotes 
  a positive self-image.   
- Social pressures: People try to change their appearance to become 
  popular or to look like others   
- Cultural beliefs and practices: Body size (In some cultures, being  
  fat is unhealthy, whereas people from other cultures believe the  
  opposite), physical appearance, hair, skin colour, etc.  
- The media often promotes ‘the perfect body’ in advertisements,  
   magazines, on TV, etc.   
- The pressure to conform with society’s rules and norms can  
  increase a person’s health risk

Air is essential for life and good health.  
   
Animals provide various sources of food, clothing, 
shelter and companionship. 
 
Trees and plants – provide food, homes and shade for 
people and animals and give off oxygen that helps them 
breathe.

Renewable resources: 
Renewable resources are part of nature and form our eco-systems (living 
and non-living organisms). 
Renewable resources include: oxygen, water, forests, plants, fruits, 
vegetables and animals. These resources are renewable as long as they 
are monitored, protected and conserved.  
 
Renewable resources are endangered by industrial development 
(agriculture, large scale fishing, mining and manufacture) and growth 
(population expansion, migration, buildings and road construction). 
  
Renewable resources must be used carefully so that they can renew 
themselves 
 
Non-renewable resources: 
A non-renewable resource is a natural resource which cannot be 
produced, grown or generated; once depleted there is no more available 
for future needs.  
 
Non-renewable resources include: fossil fuel e.g. coal, natural gas and 
petroleum (crude oil); minerals e.g. copper.
