Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 1 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                                      4 
 
PREFACE 
 
 
To assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum, several strategies were employed.  The process 
began with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions.  These countries included 
Jamaica, the United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois) Canada and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 
guides).  The documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their 
rationale and philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as 
well as the Scope of Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa 
and several other countries were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of 
English and the Ministry of Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.    
 
Opportunities were also provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers 
throughout The Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen 
teachers throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students in order to get 
their feedback on what they wanted to learn about and the types of learning activities that they enjoyed.  Additionally, a 
focus group was conducted with members from the community that included business owners, parents and those who 
interact with students in after school clubs and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary teachers, one preschool teacher and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment 
Section.  Opportunities were also provided for several of the Family Island teachers to submit content and activities 
through the Education Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time 
engaged in research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction in order to meet the needs 
of their students.

BELIEF STATEMENTS   
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student centered; 
2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make decisions as well as to develop self- 
confidence and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme 
and should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing 
sixth grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our 
students receive at the primary level, lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that 
students are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on the communication skills.  During this particular period in our history, knowledge of the basic 
communication skills is essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and 
more people are being pushed to use on-line services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct 
banking transactions, to pay bills, to make travel arrangements, to access government services and so much more.   
Additionally, changes in technology demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Land lines, 
that only required listening and speaking skills for its use, have been replaced with smart phones and computers where 
we can communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the 
internet, buy tickets, post to Facebook, create blogs, Snapchat, conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the 
world and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be that confidence in our education system that students 
will be prepared to communicate effectively in spite of the changes that occur.  Recognizing that the Language Arts skills 
are the foundation of all learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on 
producing students who are not only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability 
to communicate effectively in a rapidly advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves 
creatively, to collaborate and to problem solve as we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which 
speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education for all...”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of 
Oracy, Reading and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that 
they will need to become life-long learners and to navigate successfully in an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM  
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, 
teachers should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area 
subjects and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual fieldtrips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centers, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level in order to provide teachers and parents with a guide 
for what students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This 
information should be used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also provides an 
indication of the level of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become 
proficient in a particular area, teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted in 
order to make them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the 
end of the course of study.  Teachers should be guided by the content which indicates what students should know 
or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading 
(Phonemic Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar and 
Composition Writing). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds 
on the previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided 
into three categories:  basic, intermediate and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can

access content and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to do so, in order to 
meet the needs of their students.   
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of 
opportunities should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with 
various audiences.  They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large 
group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative 
projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary 
safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with 
students.  Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  In order to avoid 
duplication in the curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best 
applied.  It is expected that once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the 
strands and that they can be assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught the Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This 
particularly refers to reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be 
highlighted.  Students are to be exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are 
taught through teacher read-alouds and independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade 
level. 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels and Science Fiction 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading and after reading. 
 
 
 
 


Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 1 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                                      21 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening   
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in the area of reading still 
have opportunities to understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (through the use of pictures, video 
clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions    
as students connect skills to their everyday experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle  
the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing to see if students have mastered the skill is to have them  
incorporate it in a writing exercise.  This will give them an opportunity to apply what they have learnt.  Students who 
are able to apply reading skills, would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  Following this      
method of teaching the comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into  
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as 
ends in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and 
Handwriting; however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in 
the case of Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should 
only be scored for what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week the number of 
items on the checklist should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the 
checklist should be continually reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been 
generated.  Students should be aware of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to 
assess their own writing before it is even submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, 
mechanics and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three 
lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of 
grade two cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will 
be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, 
and words from the grade level word list included in the appendices of this document.

Letters and their various 
patterns are used to 
represent the sounds of 
spoken language.  This is 
known as the alphabetic 
principle. 
 
Example: 
The word ‘bat’ is made of 
the phonemes /b/ /a/ and /t/. 
 
Basic:  Distribute sound boxes 
(Elkonin boxes) and markers to 
students.  Say a word and have 
students listen to and repeat the 
sounds heard.  Have them place 
a marker into a box for each 
sound that they hear. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Intermediate:  Distribute specific 
letter cards.   Have students 
listen as given words are called. 
Ask students to raise letter cards 
to show the letter that represents 
the initial sound in the words. 
 
Advanced:  Have students listen 
to words/picture names. Then, 
have them write letter(s) which 
represents the initial or final 
sound in the words given. 
 
 
 
 
Have students listen to a group 
of words and tell which two 
words have the same beginning, 
medial or final sounds.

Activities 
Suggested 
 Assessment 
Resources 
The alphabet consists of 
twenty-six letters.  Each 
letter has an upper case and 
a lower case form. 
 
Letters can be distinguished 
according to their position on 
the line, their length, size, 
shape or the direction in 
which they lay.   
Basic:  Have students identify 
the letters of the alphabet using 
the song “The Crabs Go 
Rushing” from the Junka and 
Noo Anthology of Songs (Tune: 
The Ants Go Marching). 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
participate in a matching game. 
Give students cards with upper 
case and lower case letters. 
Have students move around the 
class to find their partners with 
the matching upper and lower 
case letters. 
 
Advanced:  Have students play 
‘Alphabet B ingo’.  Give students 
Bingo cards with letters of the 
alphabet.  Have the children look 
for the upper case and lower 
case letters that are called.  If 
students have the letter called, 
they then cover the letter with a 
game marker.  Students play 
until a card is full. 
 
 
Have students write letters in the 
case specified.

Resources 
There is a specific 
relationship between a letter 
and its sound/s.  
 
Letters are written and 
sounds are spoken. 
 
Letters are divided into 
consonants and vowels. 
 
Sounds when blended 
form/make words. 
 
Example: The letter ‘n’ 
makes the /n/ sound in these 
words: 
 
/n/ sound 
net    pin    can 
 
Basic:  Use the song “There’s a 
Sound in My Head” (Sung to the 
tune of “There’s a Hole in My 
Bucket”) and have students listen 
for specific sounds in spoken 
words and identify the positions 
the sounds are in:  beginning, 
middle or end. 
 
Intermediate:  Give students 
letter tiles.  Have students place 
letters on the desk to form words 
said by the teacher.  Have 
students say the letters/sounds 
and identify the word. 
 
Advanced:  Give students words 
that may begin or end with a 
specific letter/sound.  Have 
students identify other words that 
begin or end with the same 
sound.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment 
Resources 
 
Segmentation is breaking a 
word into its separate 
phonemes (beginning, 
medial, and ending) and 
saying each phoneme as it 
is tapped out, counted, or 
signalled. 
 
Example:  
The word ‘pan’ has three (3) 
individual sounds. 
 
/p/ /a/ /n/ 
 
The word ‘desk’ has four (4) 
individual sounds: 
 
/d/ /e/ /s/ /k/ 
 
 
Basic:  Model examples of how 
to segment a word using finger 
puppets, tapping, clapping or 
stomping. Have students 
practice segmenting the words 
using the same methods. 
 
Intermediate:  Show students 
picture cards. Have students say 
how many sounds (phonemes) 
are heard in the word, then give 
the sounds (beginning, medial 
and ending).  
 
Advanced:  Place three chairs 
in the front of the class.  
Distribute letter cards to 
students. Segment words. As 
the sounds (phonemes) are 
heard, students will take a seat 
in the chair representing the 
position in which their letter 
sound is heard.  Have the class 
determine if the students sit in 
the correct chairs. 
 
 
Have students segment words.

 Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
Phoneme blending is 
listening to a sequence of 
separately spoken sounds 
(phonemes) and then 
combining the sounds 
(phonemes) to form a word. 
 
Example:  
The sounds /l/ /i/ /d/ make 
the word ‘lid’ when blended. 
 
Basic:  Using objects in the 
classroom, say the sounds for 
the name of an object in a 
segmented fashion.  Have 
students identify the object by 
combining the sounds. 
(Example: /d/ /e/ /s/ /k/ would be 
desk). 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
use letter cards/tiles to blend 
phonemes together for the 
names of the pictures displayed. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
participate in the activity 
‘baseball.’ Divide the class into 
two teams.  The pitcher (teacher) 
says aloud a word in parts, such 
as /p/e/n/.  If the child who is ‘at 
bat’ can blend the phonemes 
correctly, he/she goes to first 
base.  Play just as in baseball, 
with each team earning a point 
when a child makes it to home 
plate. 
 
 
Have students blend sounds to 
read words.

Phoneme substitution is 
changing one word into a 
new word by changing any 
one of its phonemes.  
 
Example:  If the /s/ phoneme 
in the word ‘sit’ is changed 
to /f/, the new word is ‘fit’. 
 
Basic:  Say two words.  Have 
students give ‘thumbs up’ to 
indicate whether or not a phoneme 
substitution took place.  Have 
students say where the substitution 
was and give the sounds that were 
changed. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
participate in the activity 
‘Consonant Riddles’.  Say a word.  
Have students think of a word that 
rhymes with the word said, but 
begins with a given sound.  
(Example: What rhymes with man 
and starts with /f/?) 
 
Advanced:  Display a picture. 
Have students show substitution 
by, substituting the initial, medial or 
final phoneme to form a new word.

Consonants are the letters in the 
alphabet that are not vowels. 
The consonants are: b, c, d, f, g, 
h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, 
x, y, and z. 
  
Consonants can appear at the 
beginning, in the middle or at the 
end of words. 
  
Consonants usually represent 
one sound.  However, there are 
some consonants that have two 
sounds like g, c and x. 
 
When teaching the letter q and 
the /kw/ sound, remember that q 
is almost always followed by u in 
English words.   
  
(Please note that for advanced 
students you may introduce 
three letters in a week, average 
students 2 letters and the more 
challenged students 1 letter.  As 
students build their repertoire of 
letters, each letter sound taught 
should be reviewed daily.) 
Basic:  Play the game ‘Odd One Out’. 
Have students listen to words in a 
series to identify the word whose 
beginning sound is different.  
(This activity can be used for middle 
and final consonants as well.)  
   
Intermediate:  Have students sort 
pictures according to beginning 
or ending sounds.  
   
Advanced:  Using a worksheet, have 
students write the missing consonant in 
words for given pictures.  
  
Please note that this activity can be 
digitized using Live Worksheets or

Objective 2.13: Identify short vowel sounds in words (cvc, vc and ccvc patterns). 
Content 
Suggested 
 Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
A vowel is a speech sound 
which is produced without any 
closure or obstruction by the 
tongue, lips or teeth of air flow. 
The letters a, e, i, o and u are 
vowels. 
  
Short Vowels – CVC pattern 
CVC stands for consonant - 
vowel - consonant.  A vowel is 
usually short when it appears 
between two consonants in a 
one syllable word.   
Examples: /bat/, /sip/, /pen/ 
  
VC pattern 
VC stands for vowel - 
consonant. When a single 
vowel letter in a word or syllable 
is followed by a consonant 
letter, digraph, or blend, it 
usually makes its short sound.  
Examples:  /at/, /it/, /up/ 
 
 
Basic:  Give students a set of counters 
and picture cards whose names have 
short vowel sounds.  Have students say 
the name of their picture and listen to the 
number of sounds heard in the word.  Ask 
students to place that number of counters 
on their picture card.   
  
Intermediate:  Distribute vowel cards to 
students.   Say a word with a short vowel 
sound. Have students repeat the word 
and then hold up the correct letter card 
for the vowel sound heard in the word.  
  
Advanced:  Have students participate in 
a picture sort.   Divide students into 
groups. Give each group various pictures 
and have them place the cards under the 
correct vowel according to the sound.  
(Example: The picture of the ‘cat’ will be 
placed under short vowel a.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Show the class various 
pictures that have short 
vowel sounds and have 
them call the picture 
names.  Have the 
children write the vowel 
sound heard in each 
picture name.

teeth of air flow.  
 
CVCE pattern - CVCE stands for 
consonant - vowel -consonant 
- final e.  In a one syllable word 
that has the CVCE pattern, the 
first vowel is usually long and 
the ‘e’ is silent.   
Examples: /rake/, /dime/, /nose/.  
 
CVVC pattern- CVVC stands for 
consonant - vowel - vowel - 
consonant. VV refers to two 
adjacent vowels.  Two adjacent 
vowels- When two vowels 
appear together in a word, the 
first vowel usually gives its long 
sound and the vowel that follows 
is silent.  
Examples: /meat/, /coat/, /tail/ 
 
 
 
Basic:  Display a short 
poem/rhyme. Have students 
circle or underline CVCE / 
CVVC words in the 
poem/rhyme.  
  
Intermediate:  Let students 
participate in the activity 
‘Rhyming Tic-Tac-Toe’ using 
long vowels.  Each of the 
boxes on the game board 
should contain a word that 
has a long vowel sound.  
Have students choose a 
square on the game board.  
If they provide a rhyming 
word with a long vowel 
sound to correctly match the 
word in the given box, they 
can write or place an X or O 
in the box. The regular rules 
of Tic-Tac-Toe can be 
followed. 
  
Advanced:  Have students 
create word flip books with 
long vowel phonograms. 
(Example: /ake/, /eet/, /oat/) 
Have students complete 
sentences using long 
vowel words.  Have them 
indicate the long vowel 
sound that is heard.

Resources 
Sight words and high 
frequency words are words 
that are very common 
(encountered frequently) in 
print and used in writing).  
Sight words can sometimes 
be difficult to decode. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students play the game 
‘Simon Says’ using sight words.  Give a 
sight word to each child.  Teacher calls a 
word and names an action.  Child with 
the word called performs the action. 
Example: Simon says “it” must clap four 
(4) times. 
  
Intermediate:  Play game ‘Wordo’ 
(similar to the game Bingo).  Have 
students write sight or high frequency 
words in blocks on a Wordo sheet. 
Distribute markers.  Have students place 
a marker on words as they are called one 
at a time.  The first student to have a 
complete row covered wins. 
  
Advanced:  From a group of high 
frequency word cards, have students 
select words to form sentences.  Ask 
them to read and write the sentences 
formed. 
 
 
 
 
 
Give students sentences 
with the words being 
taught.  Have students 
circle the word that is 
called in each sentence.

A consonant digraph is two 
adjacent consonants in a 
word that produce only one 
sound. Consonant digraphs 
can be found at the 
beginning, middle or end of 
words. 
  
Examples:  
/th/ – thin, teeth 
  
/sh/ – shut, flash 
  
/ch/ – church, lunch 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  As the digraphs are introduced, 
have students say the sound and words 
that contain the digraphs.  Once 
students are comfortable with the sound 
of a particular digraph, have them read 
other simple words that contain that 
sound. 
 
Intermediate:  In pairs have students 
find, then draw and label objects in the 
classroom that contain digraphs.  Have 
them read the words and incorporate 
them into a sentence. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
sentences that contain the digraph that 
is being introduced.  As new digraphs 
are studied, incorporate them in 
sentences along with the ones that were 
previously studied.  Have students 
practice reading the sentences daily.

Assessment 
Resources 
An inflectional ending is a 
letter or group of letters 
added to a base word to 
change its meaning. 
  
Examples: 
-ing: The ending –ing added 
to a word tells about 
something that is happening 
now. 
(Example: The children are 
playing.) 
  
-ed: When –ed is added to 
the end of a word, it tells of 
something that happened in 
the past. 
(Example: The boy walked 
home from school.) 
 
Basic:  Give each student two index cards. 
Have them write -ing on one and -ed on the 
other.  Call a word and instruct them to hold 
up the card for the ending that they hear at the 
end of the word that is said.

passage that contains inflectional endings.   
Have students circle words with inflectional 
endings.  Have them read the words. 
  
Advanced:  Have students complete a word 
sort by grouping words about the present and 
words that talk about the past.  Let them use 
words from their reading textbooks and the

Objective 2.34: Use visual clues (punctuation marks) to aid reading. 
Content 
Suggested  
Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
There are certain punctuation marks that give 
cues as to how a particular sentence should 
be read. 
 
Period – Pause and take a breath before 
reading the next sentence.   
(Example: Ma is baking bread today.) 
 
Comma – Give a slight pause when there is 
a comma.  Reading too fast or too slowly can 
change the meaning of a sentence. 
(Example: Auntie Mae, mommy sent me for 
the flour.) 
 
Question Mark – The voice is normally 
raised at the end of a sentence when there is 
a question mark. This indicates that a 
response may be required.   
(Example: Would you like to have some 
bread?) 
 
Exclamation – When there is an 
exclamation mark, the reading must be 
completed with a certain emotion.   
(Example: This bread is hot!) 
Basic:  Read aloud to students so 
that they can hear how a 
particular piece should be read. 
Use a chant or poem.  Have 
students model it. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with a written copy of a recorded 
reading.  Point out the 
punctuation marks.  Have pupils 
listen to the piece being read 
especially as it pertains to the 
punctuation marks.   Have 
students imitate the person on the 
recording as it is played a second 
time. 
 
Advanced:  Place students in 
pairs.  Have them listen to each 
other reading while focusing on 
the visual clues.  Have students 
record each other until they are 
satisfied with their recordings.

Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
To make what is being read interesting to 
others, it is important to vary our volume, 
pace and pitch to match what is 
happening in the passage.   
 
Volume – Refers to how loud or how soft 
something is read.  When reading to an 
audience, the voice should be clear and 
loud so that everyone can hear.  The 
voice may change according to who is 
speaking.  Something may be read loudly 
– for instance, if a great big giant is 
speaking or if someone is angry.  A piece 
may be read softly when a person is 
whispering or trying to sneak up on 
someone. 
 
Pace – This refers to how fast or how 
slowly something is read.  When there is 
excitement or fear in the story, it can be 
read faster.  If there is sadness in the 
piece it may be read more slowly. 
 
Pitch – This refers to how high or low the 
voice is.  If a cute baby is speaking, the 
voice would be higher than if a man is 
speaking.  
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students read 
familiar nursery rhymes.  
 
Intermediate:   Have students 
read a particular text using 
different voices to reflect different 
characters and moods:  game 
announcer, baby, robot, lion, 
anger, sadness, happiness, etc. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
text that can be converted into a 
news story.  Pupils can report 
class or school news.

Resources 
The people or animals in a story 
are the characters. When reading 
a story, you can discover what 
characters look like, what they 
think, how they feel and what they 
say and do. 
  
A story usually has a beginning, 
middle, and an end.  Every story 
has a problem.  This is called the 
plot. 
  
When and where a story takes 
place is called the setting.  The 
setting can be a real or a make- 
believe place. 
 
Basic:  Before reading, give each 
student story cards with the words 
‘character’, ‘setting’ and ‘plot’ 
written on them.  Reread parts of a 
familiar story or book.  During the 
readings, have students raise the 
correct card to identify the story 
element.  For example, when you 
say a character’s name, the 
students will raise the character 
card.  
  
Intermediate:   Have students 
recall the character, setting and 
plot from a familiar Disney movie 
or Bahamian fable.  
 
Advanced:   Have students cut 
out pictures from old magazines 
news or download them from 
online.  Have students use these 
to tell their own simple stories 
involving characters, settings and 
plot.  Have students share their 
stories with the class and discuss 
the characters, setting and plot. 
 
 
 
The students will read a story 
and complete a story map.  
Identify the elements of a story 
by writing the story elements 
or drawing the elements for 
each section.

Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
Clues are sometimes given to 
help us understand the meaning 
of hard or difficult words.  These 
clues may be picture clues or 
words in the sentence. 
 
Picture Clues – Sometimes there 
are pictures of the difficult words 
to help readers.  Once readers 
can identify what is happening in 
the pictures, they can understand 
the words. 
 
Prior Knowledge – Readers must 
sometimes use their own 
knowledge and experiences along 
with the clues in the passage to 
figure out the meanings of words.   
Basic:  Show the meaning of 
unfamiliar words using pictures.  
Discuss them with students. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
read a sentence where picture 
clues are given to help them 
understand the meanings of 
unfamiliar words.  Have them 
discuss what they think the 
words mean. 
 
Advanced:  Introduce new 
words to students.  To assist 
them in understanding the new 
words, place them in context by 
relating them to students’ 
experiences. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students complete a 
worksheet where they must 
use the clues provided in order 
to complete sentences.

Things that happen in a 
story follow a specific order. 
Knowing the order helps the 
reader to understand and 
remember the story.  Clue 
words such as ‘first’, ‘next’, 
and ‘last’ help the reader to 
understand the order in 
which certain events 
happened. 
  
Words such as ‘morning’, 
‘night’ and ‘evening’ also 
tell the order in which events 
happened. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Provide students with 
picture cards.  Ask them to put the 
pictures in the correct sequence in 
order to tell the story 
  
Intermediate:  Use a digital 
camera and record someone 
cooking/making something.  Take 
snapshots of each step in the 
process as well.  Have students 
view the recording.  Then provide 
students with the snap shots.  Ask 
students to put them in the order 
in which the events happened.  If 
you do not have access to a digital 
camera, record a cooking show 
from the television.  You can also 
draw the steps if you are unable to 
provide photos. 
  
Advanced: Read a story to the 
class.  Provide students with 
sentence strips from the story.  
Have them put the strips in order

Authors sometimes use their 
imaginations to help them 
write interesting stories.  
Stories about fairies, talking 
animals and objects are not 
real. We call these types of 
stories make-believe. 
  
Books that give us 
information about a person’s 
life, things that actually 
happened and places that 
people can actually visit are 
considered real life. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students look at pictures 
and clap if they are showing real-life or 
stand if they are showing something 
make-believe.  Have students explain 
their responses.

Assessment 
Resources 
A fact is a statement that can be 
proven true or false.  This may be 
done through further reading, 
observation or by asking an 
expert. 
  
Example: “There are 30 students 
in my class.” 
 
This is a statement of fact.  It can 
be proven true or false by 
counting the number of students. 
 
An opinion tells what someone 
thinks or feels about a particular 
subject. As a result, it cannot be 
proven true or false. 
  
Words that tell how someone 
feels such as ‘thinks’ or ‘likes’ 
can be used to tell opinions. 
 
Example: “My teacher is the best 
in the world.” 
 
This is an opinion because it 
expresses how the person feels 
about his/her teacher.   
 
Basic:  Read a few statements 
to students.  Have them put their 
thumbs up if the statement is a 
fact and put their thumbs down if 
the statement provides an 
opinion. Have students give 
reasons for their responses. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with tangible objects such as a 
doll or truck.  Have them take 
turns providing a statement of 
fact about the object and a 
personal opinion about the 
object. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students 
with simple statements of facts 
and opinions.  Have them 
underline the statements that 
provide facts and circle the ones 
that provide opinions. 
 
Have students complete a 
worksheet where they must 
identify statements of fact 
and opinion.

A proverb is a common saying or 
phrase that is used to give advice or 
explain what is believed to be true 
based on experience. Some common 
ones are: 
 
An apple a day keeps the doctor 
away. 
Eat healthy and you will not have to 
visit the doctor. 
 
Always put your best foot forward. 
Do your best at whatever you are 
working. 
 
All that glitters is not gold. 
Not everything that looks good is the 
best thing for you.   
 
Beggars can’t be choosers. 
When you are relying on others to 
help you, you must take whatever 
they give you. 
 
Better late than never. 
It is better to follow through on what 
we are doing than to quit before it is 
finished.

It is important to be able to distinguish 
between the symbols that are written. 
 
Letters are symbols used in the alphabet.  
They help to make words.  Each letter has 
its own shape. 
Example: A, S, and T 
 
Numbers are symbols used to tell how 
many.  Numbers all have their own shape. 
Example: 3, 5, and 7 
 
Shapes provide the form of something. 
Example:  Circle   
                 Line   
 
Pictures are drawings of objects or people. 
Example: The sun 
 
Things are said to be the same when they 
look alike. 
 
Things are said to be different when they 
do not look alike. 
 
Basic:  Present students with 
groups of pictures or objects.  Sort 
and classify the pictures that are 
the same.

Resources 
When writing, it is important to sit 
correctly in front of a leveled writing 
surface like a desk or table.  
 
Feet:  Both feet should be placed flat on 
the floor to aid in balancing the body.  
 
Body:  Sit upright in the chairs facing the 
front. The back should be straight.  
 
Right forearm (for right-handed 
students):  The right forearm almost up 
to the elbow should rest on the table.  
 
Left forearm (for left-handed 
students):  Left-handed students should 
have the entire forearm resting on the 
writing surface.  The paper or book 
should be leveled with the edge of the 
table or slanting slightly upwards at an 
angle of about 15 degrees.  
 
Left-handed students should be 
encouraged to tilt their paper in a 
clockwise direction, bottom corner of the 
paper pointing slightly to the middle of 
the body. 
 
 
Basic:  Using various writing 
materials, have students place the 
materials in the appropriate 
positions to write based on their 
hand dominance (left or right-
handed). 
 
Intermediate:  Have right-handed 
students pick up the paper by the 
upper right-hand corner and hold it 
straight out in from of them.  Have 
students identify the most 
comfortable angle.  Have left-
handed students pick up the paper 
by the upper left-hand corner and 
hold it straight out in front of them.  
Have students identify the most 
comfortable angle.  
 
Advanced:  Have students 
demonstrate the correct posture 
for writing.  Provide them with 
feedback. 
Self Evaluation:  
- Is my paper slanted  
   properly? 
- Are my feet flat on the  
  floor? 
- Do I feel relaxed? 
- Am I sitting up straight 
  and tall?

In order to develop good 
handwriting, it is important to learn 
how to hold the pencil and or 
writing tool correctly.  
 
Correct pencil grip:  
 The pencil should be held 
‘lightly’ between the thumb and 
forefinger with the middle 
finger providing support. 
 The pencil should rest on the 
end joint of the middle finger. 
The other two fingers should 
rest lightly on the paper along 
with the side of the hands.  
 The pencil should rest in the 
hollow between the thumb and 
index finger.   
    
 
(https://www.scoilbarra.ie/correct-pencil-
grip/)  
 
 
Basic:  Using beads of different 
sizes, have students thread beads 
on string/yarn.  This task will assist 
with eye-hand coordination and grip.  
Be sure to observe all safety 
protocols and warn students not to 
put beads in their mouths.  
 
Intermediate:  Practice forming play 
dough.  Use play dough to roll, 
press, and form various patterns. 
This helps with the students’ grip, 
control and thumb flexibility. 
 
Advanced:  Using jumbo crayons/ 
pencils/ or large pieces of chalk, 
have students grip and position the 
writing tool to write given patterns or 
strokes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use jumbo/regular pencils 
to demonstrate correct 
posture and position of the 
pencil.

A sentence is a group of words that 
express a complete idea or 
thought. 
Example: “The hen is brown.” 
 
Sentences should begin with a capital 
letter and end with an end mark. 
There are three different end marks: 
period (.), question mark (?) and 
exclamation point/mark (!) 
 
A fragment is a group of words that 
does not express a complete thought 
or idea and does not make sense. 
Example: “One day the dog.” 
 
Words in a sentence should be 
placed in the correct order to make 
sense. 
Example:  
 
blue hat I a see. ✘ 
 
I see a blue hat.✔ 
 
Basic:  Students will listen to the 
reading of a group of words.  Ask 
students to put their thumbs up if 
it is a sentence and thumbs down 
if it is not a sentence.     
 
Intermediate:  Present a group 
of simple rebus sentences and 
fragments using known sight/high 
frequency words.  Using crayons, 
have students circle the complete 
sentences.    
Example: I see a . 
                    cat 
          
Advanced:  Students will be 
given a mixture of simple 
sentences and fragments.  Have 
students paste the sentences on 
one side of a T-Chart and 
fragments on the other side.        
Have students draw a 
picture and write a 
sentence about it.    
 
If students are unable to 
write sentences 
independently, provide 
students with word cards 
and pictures to be used 
to construct a rebus 
sentence.  
 
Example: 
 
  I see a  .

There are four types of sentences.  
 
A telling sentence tells 
something.  The end mark is 
called a full stop or a period (.)   
It is used at the end of each telling 
sentence.  
 
An asking sentence asks 
something and is also called a 
question.  End an asking 
sentence, or a question, with a 
question mark (?).  Asking 
sentences begin with specific 
words such as can, why, who, 
what, when, where, how and 
will. 
 
An exclamatory sentence shows 
strong feelings such as surprise, 
amusement or annoyance. An 
exclamatory sentence can sound 
like a question, but it does not 
require a response.  It ends with 
an exclamation mark (!). 
Exclamatory sentences can begin 
with words like wow, oh, hooray. 
Basic:  Have students show a 
picture of their favourite pets.  Have 
them tell one or two facts about their 
pets.  Have other students ask 
questions about the pet.  Discuss the 
different types of sentences that 
were used. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students play 
the game ‘Pin It!’.  Post sentences in 
sections of the room.  Issue students 
clothespins labelled with the end 
marks: period, exclamation mark and 
question mark.  Have students read 
sentences in groups of four and pin 
the correct end mark at the end of 
each sentence. 
 
Advanced:  Have students search in 
books, newspapers, flyers, bulletin 
boards, etc. for exclamatory, asking 
and telling sentences.  Have 
students use their tablets to take a 
picture of two examples of each type 
of sentence.   Ask students to share 
and discuss their pictures. 
Complete sentences by 
choosing the correct 
punctuation mark. 
 
Example: 
 Sally has a dog 
 this is my favourite 
book 
 the dog up 
 I like to play in the 
sand.

Resources 
Nouns, also called naming 
words, are words that name a 
person, place, animal or thing.  
 
Example:  
Person: 
girl, boy 
Place: 
park, home 
Animal: 
cat, dog          
Thing: 
cereal, hat   
    
The words above are known as 
common nouns because they do 
not name a particular person, 
place, animal or thing.  
 
Proper nouns name a special 
person, place, animal or thing. 
Proper nouns begin with a capital 
letter.  Days of the week, months 
of the year and holidays are 
proper nouns.  
 
Example:  
Person: 
Tom Smith 
Place: 
Abaco 
Animal: 
Max          
Thing: 
Pops cereal   
 
     
 
Basic:  Provide a simple picture for 
students to look at and discuss.  Ask 
students to locate and name different 
common nouns in the picture.   
 
Intermediate:  Display a colourful 
illustration depicting a place.  Ask 
students to provide special names 
for the people, places and things 
they find in the picture.

proper nouns.  Have them underline 
the common nouns and circle the 
proper nouns.

Pronouns are words that are 
used to replace nouns.  They 
include the following:  
he, she, it, we, they, them, I, you 
and me. 
 
He, she and it are pronouns that 
are often used. They represent 
one person, animal or thing.  
 
I and me are used to talk about 
ourselves. I is always capitalized 
when used as a pronoun.  
 
We and us are plural pronouns. 
They are used when referring to a 
group to which the writer or 
speaker belongs.    
 
They and them are plural 
pronouns that refer to others. 
 
Basic:  Have students play a 
matching game where they will link 
pictures of nouns to appropriate 
pronouns. 
 
Intermediate:  Distribute pronoun 
word cards.   Ask students to listen 
to the reading of short sentences. 
Read each sentence twice.  During 
the second reading, leave out the 
noun by saying, “Blank”.  Have 
students display the pronoun card 
that can be used to replace the noun 
that was deleted.   
 
Examples: 
 Shayla went home. 
 ______ went home. (She)

There are special ways to say or write 
verbs to tell when something happens.  
For actions that are happening now, 
the present tense is used. For actions 
that have already happened, the past 
tense is used.  
 
Present Tense:             
To show the present tense, -ing can 
be added to a verb to tell that 
something is happening now.   
Example: “She is playing in the park.” 
 
Past Tense: 
To show the past tense, -ed is added 
to tell that something has already 
happened.   
Example: “John worked on his car.” 
Basic:  Have students listen to a 
list of verbs.  Ask students to 
stand if the verb is in the present 
tense and sit if it is not.     
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
sing the nursery rhyme “Hey 
Diddle, Diddle”.  Ask students to 
list all past tense verbs mentioned 
in the nursery rhyme.

Resources 
A sentence has two parts: the 
naming part and the telling or 
action part.  
 
The subject of a sentence tells 
who or what the sentence is 
about.   
 
Example: 
The man has a big hat. 
The sentence is about the man.  
 
The predicate of a sentence tells 
about the subject. 
 
Example: 
The man has a big hat. 
 
It can also tell what the subject is 
doing or did.  
 
Example: 
The boy ran all the way to 
school. 
Basic:  Using familiar nursery 
rhymes, have students tell the 
naming parts and the telling parts of 
sentences.  
 
Intermediate:  Have students read a 
sentence and draw a line to separate 
the naming and telling parts. 
 
Advanced:  Using a magnet and a 
string, have students fish for the 
naming or telling parts of a sentence. 
When a part of a sentence is caught, 
a naming or telling part should be 
added by the student for completion.

coming to the front of the class to 
select a word from the bag. Have 
them perform that action. Record a 
sentence on the board that tells 
about the action. Ask students the 
cue questions to have them identify 
the simple subjects and simple 
predicate of the sentences.  
 
Intermediate:  Using rebus 
sentences, have students identify the 
simple subjects and simple predicate 
of the sentences. 
 
Advanced:  Distribute word cards 
that make a sentence. Have those 
students with word cards come to the 
front of the room to form the 
sentence. Once the sentence has 
been made correctly formed, the 
student holding the simple subject 
will sit and the simple predicate will 
dance. Discuss with the class 
whether or not they were correct.  
 
 
 
 
Present students with a 
group of sentences 
(worksheets or white 
board). Have students 
circle the simple subject, 
then colour the circle green 
(or any other colour). Then 
have students draw a 
rectangle around the 
simple predicate, then 
colour the rectangle orange 
(or any other colour).

The naming part of a sentence 
can name one or more than one.  
If the noun is singular 
(representing one) an ‘s’ is added 
to the verb. 
 
Example: 
John works on his project.  
 
When using the pronouns ‘he’, 
‘she’ and ‘it’, add an ‘s’ to the 
verb.

Before beginning to write, it is 
important to stop and get your 
ideas ready for writing.  There are 
several ways to do this. 
 
 Look at or draw pictures 
about the topic.  
 Ask questions like “Who?”, 
“What?”, “Where?” and 
“When?” to help you write 
about your ideas 
 Think about what you 
already know about the 
topic and make a list. 
 Talk to someone about the 
topic. 
 Pick the best ideas about 
which to write. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students draw pictures 
of things that they like to do.  Have 
them choose one of the activities and 
dictate or write a sentence about 
something that is happening in the 
picture.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students make 
clay models or draw pictures of 
members of their family.  Have them 
choose a family member about which 
to write.  Have them ask the 5W 
questions to help them write about 
the person.  
 
Advanced:  Have students make a 
list of things that they do before they 
go to bed.  Have them select one 
about which to write.  Have them ask 
the 5W questions to help write more 
about the activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provide students with a 
topic.  Have them 
provide ideas on how it 
can be narrowed.

When telling a story, tell what 
happened in the correct order.  
Put ideas in order by telling what 
happened in the beginning, in the 
middle and at the end.  Use words 
like ‘first’, ‘next’, ‘then’ and ‘last’ 
to help you.   
 
When talking about a particular 
time, use words like ‘morning’, 
‘afternoon’, ‘evening’, 
‘yesterday’, ‘today’, ‘last night’, 
etc.  This will help the readers 
understand when events are 
taking place. 
 
 
Basic:  Have three students come to 
the front of the class.  Use “order” 
words to have them stand in a 
particular formation.  Have the class 
use order words to explain where a 
particular student is standing. 
 
Intermediate:  Make a pitcher of 
lemonade with the assistance of 
students.  Take a picture that 
corresponds with each step in the 
process.  Using the LCD projector 
and power point, display the pictures.  
With the class, use time order words 
to write what happened under each 
picture.  Put the completed slides 
together to make a class book to 
which students can refer. 
 
Advanced:  Have students use time 
order words to write what steps they 
take to get ready in the morning.

When writing about a particular 
topic, include a sentence that tells 
about what you are writing.  Make 
sure that all the sentences are 
about that topic. 
 
Basic:  Display pictures of furniture, 
animals and fruits.  Have students 
put the pictures that are alike 
together.  Ask them to think of a title 
for each of the three groups.  Explain 
that, when we write, the sentences 
should all be about the topic. Below 
is an example from the animal group:  
 
There are many wild animals in 
the forest.  The monkeys play in 
the trees.  The snakes hide in the 
grass.  The birds fly high in the 
sky.  The animals have fun in the 
forest.  
 
Intermediate: Have students spot 
the sentence that does not belong.   
 
Example: 
Read a paragraph about a dog.  
Include one sentence about a fish.  
Ask them to find the sentence that 
does not belong and explain why it 
should be taken out. 
 
Advanced:  Have students listen to 
a popular nursery rhyme.  Have them 
identify what it is about and some of 
the details from it. 
Place a sentence strip 
(on which a main idea 
sentence is written on 
the board.  Give students 
sentence strips that have 
some supporting details 
that pertain to that main 
idea sentence and some 
that do not.  Have 
students select the ones 
that are related to the 
main idea and place 
them under the main 
idea.  Discuss their 
responses.

When writing, how the story or 
piece begins is very important.  
The writer should try to grab the 
attention of the person who is 
reading the piece right away.   
This can be done in several ways. 
 
 Begin with a question.  
Do you have a dog as a 
pet? 
 Start with lots of action.  
Max the dog gave a loud 
bark and ran quickly to the 
door. 
 Use sound words.  “Bow-
wow,” said the cute, fluffy 
puppy in the little basket. 
 Use a word that 
expresses strong 
feelings or emotions such 
as: 
Ouch!  
Oops!  
Hooray! 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
stories being read that have sound 
words, like “Jack & the Beanstalk” 
and “The Three Billy Goats Gruff”.  
Have them identify the sound words 
in the story.  Ask them to use some 
of the sound words in their stories.  
 
Intermediate:  Present students with 
a topic from one of the social science 
subjects.  Ask them to share what 
they know about that topic.  Have 
them begin a writing piece on the 
topic by asking a “What” or a “Why” 
question.  Have them answer it in 
their writing. 
 
Advanced:  Have students write 
about a very good or very bad day.  
Ask them to begin it with lots of 
action. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provide students with a 
topic on which to write.  
Have them compose an 
interesting introduction.  
Use a simple rubric to 
evaluate their responses.

bring the pieces to an end.  There 
are several ways to do this. 
 
 Solve the problem. 
 Give the lesson that was 
learned. 
 Say what you think about 
what happened in the 
piece.

about a problem that occurs at 
school such as garbage on the 
ground.  Have them conclude with a 
way to solve the problem.

When writing, it is important to 
sound interested in what is being 
written.   
 
Stories should be written as if they 
are being told to a friend.  Be 
funny if it suits what is being said.  
If there is something sad being 
said, use words that would make 
the reader feel sad. 
 
Be as detailed as possible.  Be 
sure to use the senses in 
describing people, places and 
things.   
 
Be clear when writing.  Give good 
explanations when sharing the 
steps to complete something. 
 
Give strong reasons to support 
any opinions you are sharing.  
Keep it serious so that the reader 
pays attention to what is being 
said. 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students pay attention 
to the music in a Walt Disney 
fairytale when there is happiness, 
sadness, fear or anger.  Discuss how 
the music changes to suit the mood.  
Relate this to the moods when 
writing. 
 
Intermediate:  Record students 
telling about times when they were 
happy, sad or angry or use suitable 
videos.  Discuss their voices, 
gestures, posture as the stories were 
being relayed so that students can 
relate them to the message. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students with 
pictures of emoticons such as happy, 
sad, angry and scared.  Read short 
passages to students that reflect 
these emotions.  Have them raise 
the correct emoticon that reflects that 
mood.  Have them discuss why they 
chose particular emoticons. 
 
 
 
Have students write 
about a particular topic.  
Use a rubric to assess

Many people can tell the same 
story about an experience, but it 
will be different for each of them 
because they all looked at what 
happened in different ways. 
 
Use words like ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’ and 
‘we’ to tell a story about yourself. 
Basic:  Have two students take turns 
looking at a picture through the long 
tube of a hand towel roll (one really 
close up and the other a little further 
away).  Ask the students to share 
what they think the picture is about.  
Show them the picture and discuss 
the differences in what they saw and 
the fact that they both had different 
views based on what they had seen.  
Relate this to writing. 
  
Intermediate:  Read the story of the 
“Three Little Pigs” from the pigs’ 
perspectives and then from the wolf’s 
perspective.  Have students discuss 
the differences. 
 
Advanced:  Have students watch a 
video of a dog playing with its owner.  
Stop the video and ask students 
what they think the dog is thinking at 
certain points.  How is the dog 
feeling?  Use this to write a story with 
them from the perspective of the 
dog. 
 
 
 
Have students write 
about an event they 
experienced with their 
mothers.  Then, have 
them write the same 
story as if their mothers 
were telling the story.

Poems are a fun way of expressing 
our ideas and thoughts.  They can 
come in many different forms.  
Rhyming Poems: 
In rhyming poems, the words at the 
end of line pairs rhyme. There 
should be about the same number 
of words in the line pairs that rhyme 
so that the flow of the poem is 
consistent.  
  
ABC Poem:  
An ABC poem lists words in 
alphabetical order to create a poem. 
The poem can use all 26 letters of 
the alphabet, or it can use just a 
part of the alphabet, but it is 
important that the words appear in 
alphabetical order.  No letter can be 
skipped in the sequence.  
 
List Poems:  
List poems are written as lists.  
There may simply be a list of words, 
or there may be a common phrase 
in each line.  All the lines must refer 
to the person or thing that the poem 
is about.  
Basic:  Have students listen to 
nursery rhymes and select the 
words that rhyme.  Have students 
create a list of other words that 
rhyme with these words.  Have 
them use these words to create 
poems of their own.  
Intermediate:  Ask students to 
write a list poem about school.

Writing stories is a way of telling 
about something that happened.  
Stories should have a beginning, 
middle and an end.   
 
Stories should tell about animals 
or people that are included in the 
events.  These are called story 
characters.  What did they say?  
How did they look?  Where did 
they go? 
 
Stories should also give an idea of 
where the events are happening. 
At the beach?  In a park?  In the 
mall?  This is called the setting or 
the place where the stories are 
taking place. 
 
Stories should give a problem and 
explain how the problem is solved.  
Basic:  Read a short story to 
students.  Have them identify the 
characters in the story, the place 
where the story takes place and the 
problem that needed to be solved. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students tell a 
story about something exciting that 
happened to them.  Have them state 
who was there, where it happened 
and what the events were that 
happened.  Relate this to what 
should happen when writing a story. 
 
Advanced:  Have students use a 
story outline to tell what happened 
first, next and last.  Have them use 
this to write their stories.  They 
should include details about the 
characters and setting.

In descriptive writing, it is 
important to describe people, 
animals, places, items, etc. in 
such detail that readers can 
picture them in their minds as they 
read.  
Using the senses to help build 
descriptions is key.  Include what 
you can see, feel, taste, smell or 
hear.  
Comparing one thing to another is 
another way of helping with 
descriptions.  
Example: “The man was tall and 
skinny like a flagpole.” 
 
 
Basic:  Have students create a 
“Favourites Book”.  On the cover, 
have them draw a picture of 
their favourite food and identify it on 
the cover.  On each page, have them 
write sensory words related to how it 
looks, sounds, feels, smells and 
tastes.   
Intermediate:  Have students 
compare food to other things.   
Example: 
 The bread was as soft as a 
pillow. 
 The candy was as hard as a 
rock. 
 The Kool-Aid was as sweet as 
cotton candy. 
Advanced:  Have students write 
sentences that include descriptions 
of their favourite foods. 
 
Please note that the activities above can be 
used as separate activities, or all can be 
used to help write the book referred to in 
Activity one.

prompt.  Have them write 
sentences that include 
descriptive words related

In addition to writing stories and 
describing events or people, there 
is a type of writing that just gives 
directions or provides information. 
We call this type of writing, 
expository writing.  
 
Examples of expository writing 
are: 
 
 Classroom Rules 
 Textbooks 
 Instructions 
 Recipes 
 Flyers 
 Invitations 
 Reports 
 
When providing information, begin 
with a sentence that tells about 
what you will be writing.  Then, 
give the details.  End with a 
sentence that tells about what you 
have just written in another way. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Read examples of expository 
writing to students.  Discuss their 
purpose.  Have students identify 
examples of expository writing in 
their environment. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students write 
about themselves (autobiography). 
 
Advanced:  Have students tell how 
to do some chores at home such as 
washing the dishes, sweeping the 
floor or bathing a pet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provide students with an 
expository prompt.  Have 
them write sentences about 
that prompt.  Use a rubric 
to assess their responses.

An opinion tells how a person 
thinks or feels about a particular 
thing.  Sometimes, writers want to 
convince others to believe the 
same thing that they do. 
 
When writing to persuade, writers 
should state how they feel and 
then provide at least two reasons 
why they feel that way.  They 
should end by saying once again 
how they feel about that particular 
thing. 
 
Basic:  Have students share the 
reasons they have given their 
parents to take them to a particular 
place like the movies or the carnival. 
Connect this to persuasive writing.  
 
Intermediate:  Revisit the story of 
“Little Red Riding Hood”.  Discuss 
how the wolf tried to convince Little 
Red Riding Hood that he was her 
grandmother.  Apply this to students’ 
writing. 
 
Advanced:  Have students select a 
favourite cereal.  Have them write to 
persuade their parents/guardians to 
purchase the cereal.  They should 
include at least two reasons in their 
writing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assign a persuasive topic 
to students.  Use a rubric 
to assess their writing.

The Reading Block 
 
The Reading Block for lower primary refers to the 90-minute double period dedicated exclusively for the teaching of reading.  This 
daily instructional block encourages the integration of the five components of reading (phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, 
fluency and comprehension).  Within this block, time should be allocated for guided reading where teachers hear students read in 
small groups as well as individually.   
 
Useful Information about the Teaching of Reading 
 
 
THE READING LEVELS 
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate. 
 
 
Basal Readers 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-leveled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach (reading 
for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate reading 
material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension skills and 
vocabulary skills.

Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
  
The Language Experience Approach 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This approach 
can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an experience for 
students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the board or on chart 
paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the language arts components 
(speaking, listening, writing and reading) and helps the children to see relationships:  
 
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Guided Reading: 
Guided Reading refers to teachers working with students in small groups to provide support in reading and comprehending 
designated texts.     
 
Oral Reading: 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
The checklist can be used to guide the teachers’ observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read orally. 
The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps the 
teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.

Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings in relation to the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, science 
and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, the more demand for reading 
skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  Lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ ability and interests and be ready to help students find the right books at the right 
time.  Learning Students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can be 
found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage students to 
visit their school libraries.

Important Phonics Rules 
  
 
1. C has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /k/ or /s/.  It is pronounced /k/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in words like 
‘can’, ‘cough’ and ‘cut’.  C makes its soft sound /s/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘cent’, ‘city’ and 
‘cycle’. 
 
2. G has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /g/ or /j/.  It makes its hard sound /g/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in 
words like ‘gate’, ‘goat’ or ‘got’.  G makes its soft sound /j/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘gem’, ‘gills’ or 
‘gym’.  There are some exceptions to this rule as in words like ‘get’, ‘give’ and ‘gift’. 
 
3. The CVC pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel and then another consonant.  When this 
happens, the vowel usually gives its shorts sound.  Examples are words like ‘bed’, ‘man’ and ‘hat’.  
 
4. The Final E or CVCE pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel, another consonant and a final 
e.  In instances where this occurs, the first vowel gives its long sound (says its name) and the e is silent.  Examples of 
words that follow this pattern are ‘made’, ‘hole’, ‘cube’ and ‘date’. 
 
5. The CV pattern refers to words that only have one-syllable.  In these two-letter words, the vowel normally gives its long 
sound as in words like ‘go’ and ‘me’.  Some one-syllable words do not follow this pattern as in words like ‘to’ and ‘do’. 
 
6. R-Controlled vowels refer to vowels that are followed by the letter r.  When this happens, the sound of the r usually 
dominates the vowel sound, and the sound that the vowel makes is neither a short or a long sound.  Words like ‘cart’, ‘far’ 
and ‘for’ are examples of the r-controlled sounds. 
 
7. When gh follows ‘i’, the ‘i’ gives its long sound and the ‘gh’ is silent.  ‘Thigh’ and ‘right’ are examples of this rule. 
 
8. In words that begin with kn and wr, only the sound for the second letter is heard.  In the words ‘knot’ and ‘wreck’ the n 
and r sounds are heard. 
                                                                                      Adapted from Language Arts by Gail Tompkins

Vowel Generalizations 
 
The following are some of the most common vowel generalizations. 
 
a. In one syllable words containing two vowel letters (one of which is a final e) the first vowel usually represents a long vowel 
sound, the e is silent. (e.g. kite, bite). 
b. In a one-syllable word that ends with a vowel, the vowel that follows the consonant is usually long (e.g. he, go – open 
syllable). 
c. A vowel is usually short when it appears between two consonants in a one-syllable word (e.g. hat, fox, dig – closed 
syllable). 
d. When i is followed by gh, nd,  or ld, the i usually represents its long sound (e.g. find, child, light). 
e. The vowel o followed by –ld usually has a long sound (e.g. old).  
f. If the only vowel in a word or syllable is an a followed by w, ll and u, the sound of the a is usually that of a short o (e.g. 
wall).  
g. When two vowels appear together in a word, the first vowel usually gives its long sound and the vowel that follows is silent. 
This rule is usually consistent with ai, oa, ee and ay combinations. 
h. Each vowel letter may represent the soft schwa sound often heard in the unaccented syllable (e.g. disappear, telegram). 
i. Y functions as a vowel when it concludes words of more than one syllable (e.g. dad/dy) and it follows a vowel (e.g. day).

Writing Instruction 
 
Daily Written Composition 
The timetable for the Lower Primary Grades provides daily periods for Written Composition instruction with a total of five (5) 
periods weekly.  In some instances, a daily allotment of 30 minutes for written composition may not be feasible; hence, the time 
allotment for instruction is five periods per week.  According to research and best practices being currently used, composition 
writing should follow a balanced literacy approach.    
 
Instructional Strategy: 10 Day Writing Plan   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
The “Ten Day Writing Plan” is a pilot writing model developed to support the daily teaching of written composition. This plan can 
be adapted for use at all primary grades.  It is research based and contains the following components of good writing instruction: 
 
· Mentor Texts 
· Enriching Experiences to Build Background Knowledge 
· Vocabulary Building Activities 
· The Writing Process 
· Writing Instructional Strategies 
- Modeled Writing 
- Interactive Writing 
 
The W.A.V.E is an acronym that is used to indicate what should be included a good piece of writing.  The letters refer to: 
Wonderful Introduction 
Add a Topic Sentence 
Very Specific Detail 
Exciting Ending

A) Impromptu Writing 
 
POST TEST:  
Have students write a 
composition that includes 
dialogue.       
 
“A Day in the Life of a 
Crab”.    
 
Students will have the 
opportunity to rewrite their 
piece without guidance by 
the teacher. The purpose 
of rewriting the piece is to 
monitor students’ progress 
and ability to apply the 
skills independently.

MATHEMATICS
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit


iv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 –  2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection.

A DISCUSSION 


xii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example, Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics. 
 
Concepts 
 
 
 
Scheme or plan for Mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and fractions,  
 
Content Standards   
            Cover what students are to learn in various subject areas, such as Mathematics and Science.  
 
Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three.

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
                                                                                                                       
 
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


xvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

BENCHMARKS: GRADES 1 - 3

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at  
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended. 
 
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE 


xxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.  
 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 


xxii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested. 
BEST PRACTICES IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS

 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1 - 6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students. 
 
 Teach to the needs of each group of students during guided mathematics activities. 
 
 Integrate mathematics across the curriculum. 
 
 Give tests at the end of a concept or unit.  This will identify students learning and the effectiveness of teacher strategies/practices. 
 
 Give post-test at the end of the school year to determine students’ successes.  
 
 Record results from the assessments in teachers’ Mark Book, portfolios, and formal reports. 
 
 Host Mathematics competitions to give students the opportunity to compete with their peers and solidify skills and concepts taught. 
 
 Teacher training/upgrading in mathematics instruction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 


xxvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 
Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES 


xxvii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
 
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of comprehension than those under Understand. 
 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 
Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
 putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
 production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 
Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three distracters.  
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, 
or a multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical thinking 
skills.  Furthermore, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in working with 
timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various components of the 
examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques and timed tests/ 
quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently write National 
Examinations. 
 
 CREATE…………..originate, predict, and design 
 EVALUATE………defend, revise, and measure 
 ANALYZE………..examine, deduce, and compare 
 APPLY……………classify, organize, and solve 
 UNDERSTAND…..describe, paraphrase, and summarize

In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                 
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful by relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life; 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


xxx 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
1. Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The  next day, 
discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
2. Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
3. Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
4. Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
5. Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
6. Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the most points?) 
and 
 
7. Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY (POD) 


xxxi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can: 
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do.  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed.  
 
delete extraneous information.  
 
identify the parts in the question.  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best.  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved.  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information.  
 
share student-generated questions.  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers.   
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
*NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

PRIMARY SCIENCE MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Primary Science Unit recognizes the place of science in everyday human affairs and aim for scientific literacy that is operational in understanding 
oneself. We seek to provide a level of understanding and scientific literacy that will prepare students to be informed and participative citizens who are able to 
make judgments and decisions regarding science applications that may have social, health or environmental impacts. 
 
 
 
BROAD OBJECTIVES 
 
The team responsible for effecting the necessary revisions to the Primary Science Curriculum holds the view that the curriculum should achieve two 
broad objectives:

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

6. Describe physical 
changes that occur at 
each stage of human 
development. 
 
Infants are small. They 
are born with no teeth 
and sleep a lot. Infants 
cannot care for 
themselves. From a 
baby, human beings 
enter the child stage. 
Children can talk, walk 
and run. They begin to 
learn how to take care of 
themselves. From this 
stage,  a child moves into 
a teenager. Teenagers 
then become adults. 
Adults are able to care 
for themselves. They do 
not get taller but change 
as they grow older.

1. Compare 
pushes and pulls. 
A force is a push or a pull. 
Pushes and pulls make 
things move or stop 
moving. A push or a pull 
can make something 
change direction. A hard 
push moves things 
quickly, but a gentle push 
moves things slowly. 
When objects are pushed, 
they move away from us, 
but when objects are 
pulled, they move towards 
us. Heavy objects need 
more force to be moved 
than light objects. Forces 
such as wind and flowing 
water can be used to make 
things move also. 
● Making 
inferences 
● Collaboration 
Guess What 
1. The class will be divided into 
groups. Each group will be given 
an activity to perform by pushing 
or pulling, the other students will 
guess what the group is doing. 
3. Students demonstrate how they 
would move a big boulder. Then, 
they would demonstrate how they 
would move a box of cotton.

A magnet is a piece of iron 
that can attract or pull 
things. The things it pulls are 
usually made of metal. Some 
magnets are found in nature 
(lodestone). A magnet has 
two poles. These are the 
places where its pulling 
force is strongest. Every 
magnet has a north pole and 
a south pole. They are often 
called the N pole and the S 
pole. Two poles that are 
different attract each other. 
Two poles that are the same, 
repel or push each other

1. Divide students into 
groups. Give each group 3 
objects to predict whether a 
magnet will attract it or repel 
it. Then they will experiment 
to test their predictions. All of 
the objects will be classified 
under the headings: Attract 
and Repel. 
Making magnets: The 
students will be divided into 
groups. Metal objects such as 
paper clips, nail, and scissors 
will be placed in each group. 
Each object will be tested to 
see if it would attract paper 
clips. Then the objects will be 
stroked twenty times in the 
same direction. 
Magnets 
Iron filings 
Students use magnets to pick up paper 
clips, pins or thumb tacks to 
demonstrate the objects that will be 
attracted. They will draw the picture 
after making the observation. Under 
the picture, explain where the poles are 
on the magnet and state how they 
know that. 
Group assessment. Each group will be 
given objects to use as a magnet: nail, 
pen, file, comb, etc. They will stroke 
the objects to magnetize them. Then, 
they will attempt to attract objects such 
as tissue, yarn, thread, paper, etc. This 
activity will be demonstrated in front 
of the class. The assessment will be 
based on the success of the 
experiment.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method 
❖ 
Cooperative Learning Technique 
❖ 
Student-centred vs. Teacher-centred Learning 
❖

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
 Provide guidance for the students. 


 
  
 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps:

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere. 


332 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and 
teachers. As the internet is constantly changing, some websites may become non-functional, outdated or unsuitable.

Journals and Logs: Science, Conversation, and Writing 
This article from Perspectives in Education and Deafness describes different types of logs and journals and includes ideas for how they can be used in the science classroom. 


 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

I. “OWL STRATEGY” 
Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic.

VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.

PREFACE 
The Primary Social Studies Curriculum Guidelines reflect the 10 strands and the standards of the National Council of Social Studies.  The curriculum is designed to 
meet the needs of a diverse student population and lends itself to differentiated instruction.  Hence, the Primary Social Studies Curriculum is designed to ensure that 
students are equipped with the necessary knowledge, attitudes and skills that are required for the 21st century.  These skills are referred to as the ‘four Cs’.  They are 
the skills of ‘critical thinking’, ‘communication’, ‘collaboration’ and ‘creativity’.   
Social Studies is inclusive of different areas of study, ranging from History and Geography to Civics and Economics, among others as comprised in this document.  It 
is important that students at the varying grade levels are exposed to the various aspects of Social Studies in order to provide the essential prerequisites necessary for 
effective spiraling of content and skills. 
The appendix comprises of culturally relevant suggestions for integration and the interconnections of content and topics, ring plays, Bahamian songs, teacher- created 
jingles, suggested virtual assessment tools, apps, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Preamble of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of The 
Bahamas, a rubric for assessing students’ projects, suggested field experiences and websites as well the various maps to use to ensure that the teaching of geography is 
strategic.  
The Primary Social Studies and Tourism Education for The Bahamas, levels one through six, and the School Atlas for the Commonwealth of The Bahamas are the 
required texts for the teaching of Primary Social Studies.  These texts were written by Bahamian educators in conjunction with Hodder Education, (formerly Pearson) 
and are designed with and inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning with suggested activities and strategies to engage the learner.  The document allows for 
additional resources to be used to supplement the instructional programme in order to remain culturally relevant and current in an ever-changing society and world. 
It is believed that this document will facilitate in the content being relevant, engaging, meaningful and enduring as the experiences are grounded on the national 
standards of Social Studies.

SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief systems, such 
as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and beliefs? What does 
language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, sociology and anthropology, 
as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one to 
develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? How has 
the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme typically appears in 
courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things located? 
Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have for people? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to adulthood? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are maintained or 
changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by institutions? How do 
institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with sociology, 
anthropology, psychology, political science and history.  
 
 
 


 
11 | P a g e  
 
 
Power, Authority  
Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is power? What 
form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, structured, maintained 
and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing 
with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of the 
factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic concepts 
and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is new 
technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which is 
unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people benefit 
from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural and physical 
sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, civics and 
government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme typically 
appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. Students 
confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the balance 
between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world community? How can I 
make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, cultural anthropology and 
fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas. Mary Ingraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 


 
xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirations and feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

We believe that:

2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make decisions as well as to develop self-confidence and greater freedom of 
expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction; 
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective; 
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. All students should be given the opportunity to develop spiritual, moral and ethical values; 
11. The principles and teachings of Christianity should be applied to all aspects of daily living.

RATIONALE 
 
Throughout our ever-changing world, there is a basic longing for human beings to connect with the spiritual side of their existence.  Even very young children 
express a natural curiosity about their existence and purpose. This curiosity leads to a search to find answers to fundamental questions such as:  Why am I here?  
Why do people suffer? What happens after death?  Religion serves the purpose of connecting human beings with their Creator, enabling them to explore answers 
to some of life’s mysteries.  
 
Religious Studies affords learners opportunities to explore religious beliefs and practices and how they impact individuals and the society.  It enables them to 
consider and respond to fundamental questions about their purpose in life.  It promotes the development of values and morals, enabling students to make informed 
decisions on moral and ethical issues.  Moreover, Religious Studies provides opportunities for students to demonstrate respect for other people, their opinions and 
beliefs. 
 
The aim of Religious Studies, therefore, is to help students develop skills for lifelong learning, enabling them to become productive citizens and stewards of the 
Earth. The Christian beliefs and values that are esteemed in this society will be transmitted to our students, providing them with a foundation on which they can 
develop good character, strengthen social relationships and build strong communities.  Ultimately, students will be equipped with the necessary skills, values and 
attitudes for life and work in the 21st century. 
 
The Religious Studies Curriculum supports the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (2015-2030) which promote equality for all, protection of our 
natural resources and peaceful societies.

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies should be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.   
 
 
The following example indicates how the curriculum objectives are number: 
Example: 1.1.A.1.1

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip 
them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They are 
respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as that state of well-
being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human development. 
This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration with Government 
Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will include sensitization and training 
for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit will 
coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, substance abuse 
prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be conducted to 
address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles through 
training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. Life is the most valuable, natural possession to be nurtured and protected at all times by everyone. 
 
2. The stabilization of family is the key to the management of most of the social problems. 
 
3. Health is essential to the well-being of all individuals. 
 
4. Academic achievement and student health and well-being are inextricably linked. 
 
5. HFLE, with its emphasis on prevention and multi-disciplinary approaches, has the potential to address many of the social problems and impact 
behaviors and lifestyles. 
 
6. HFLE aims to address the whole child and to nurture emotional, physical, mental and moral development. It takes into account both affective and 
cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome. 
 
8. HFLE is the means by which positive values, attitudes and behaviors, knowledge and skills can be taught. The core skills, which the young 
develop within HFLE, can be translated into all areas of their lives. 
 
9. HFLE creates an atmosphere of trust, openness, sincerity and honesty, which contributes to positive interpersonal relationships. 
 
10. HFLE draws heavily on the experiences of students and educators and deals with young people in the context of home, school and community 
relationships.  
 
11. HFLE produces individuals who, cognizant of their roles in society, will make a positive contribution to national, regional and international 
development.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in learning, 
the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the development of individuals 
and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many important social, cultural and health issues 
in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown that confident, well-informed and well-supported 
young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the lifelong 
acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In order for 
individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address issues and 
risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 
HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse and drug dealing, negative 
sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, Sexuality 
and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is interrelated and has been 
developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary methods. 
Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of accurate knowledge, skills development and exploration of values and attitudes. Health and Family Life classes 
afford students opportunities to build competencies for healthy self-development to deal with the challenges of life as well as make positive contributions 
to national, regional and international development. 
 
Finally, the activities and ideas presented in this document are not exhaustive.  You may be able to find many more to match the lesson topics and the 
specific objectives.  Please feel free to do this and share your ideas with other teachers for the enrichment of the programme and the development of our 
children.

People look different, but generally they all have the same 
body parts. These parts help them to function.  
 
External body parts include: head, face, lips, neck, eyes, 
ears, mouth, nose, arms, breasts, hands, fingers, legs, feet, 
toes, skin, vulva and vagina (girls), scrotum and penis 
(boys).   
 
Internal body parts include: lungs, heart, brain, kidney, 
stomach, tongue, bone, intestines, bladder, etc.   
 
Each body part has a special function e.g. the eyes see, ears 
are for hearing, nose is for smelling, feet are for walking, 
tongue is for tasting, etc. 
 
Human beings are made up of body, mind and spirit or 
social, mental and physical. To be healthy we need balance 
in our physical, mental, spiritual and social life.  
Level 1: Identify body parts from a 
picture chart and state their functions.  
 
Level 2: Differentiate between external 
and internal body parts. 
 
Level 3: Compare themselves now to 
pictures of when they were a baby e.g. 
height, weight, features, etc.

EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
The body is special, valuable and unique. (Review 
Body Parts in Standard 2.1) 
 
The parts of the body covered by a swimming suit are 
the parts that are always private. Any touching on 
those parts of the body, any secret touching, or any 
touching that makes you feel uncomfortable, worried 
or upset should be reported to an adult you trust.   
 
Good or safe touches are healthy and make you feel 
safe and comfortable e.g. pat on the back, hugs, etc. 
These are ways to show love, support, affection and 
friendship.   
 
Bad or unsafe touches make you feel confused, 
frightened or uncomfortable. This type of touching 
includes: kissing, and touching  or fondling private 
parts, pushing, shoving, hitting, etc.  
Level 1: Draw a picture (a) demonstrating a “good” touch that 
shows caring and kindness. b) showing the parts of the body 
not to be touched by strangers. 
 
Level 2: List examples of (a) “good” touch; (b) “bad” touch. 
 
Level 3: Write three sentences telling what they should do in a 
“bad” touch situation. 
 
Levels 1 – 3:  
Role-play scenarios that include (a) a student receiving a 
“good” touch e.g. hugging, pat on the back; (b) a student 
encountering a “bad” touch, e.g. pushing, shoving.  
 
Create a chart listing persons who can and cannot touch your 
private zone.

Strategies (Motives) used by Sexual Offenders/Predators  
- Inappropriate or overly friendly behaviour  
- Special interest or attention given to one child above others e.g. gift 
giving 
-Telling secrets 
- Threats to the individual or family members  
 
Sometimes, it is okay for others to touch private parts e.g. parents, 
doctors or nurses sometimes need to touch private parts when they take 
care of you or examine you for health reasons.  
 
Most touching done by adults is good touching, but children need to 
know what to do when someone touches private parts inappropriately. 
. Children should not keep ‘inappropriate touching’ secret. 
Safety Tips: Say No, Go and Tell 
• Say NO! 
• Get Away 
• Tell an Adult  
 Levels 1- 3 cont’d:  
Create a poster that illustrates (a) safe 
touch; (b) unsafe touch 
 
Write an essay on when it is 
appropriate and/or who are authorized 
to touch areas of your body that are 
private and state the condition under 
which this can be done.

Germs are tiny organisms or living things that are found 
everywhere, in all kinds of places. Some germs are helpful to 
the body and some are harmful.  
 
There are four major types of germs: bacteria, viruses, fungi, 
and parasites. They can invade plants, animals, and people, and 
sometimes they make them sick or cause diseases.  
 
Germs are spread in the air, through body fluids (saliva, blood, 
etc), by insets (mosquitoes, flies, ticks)  
 
The very smallest germs are called viruses which cause 
common diseases such as cold, flu, measles and chicken pox.  
 
Preventive Measures  
- Wash your hands regularly especially after using the restroom, 
   sneezing or coughing 
- Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing 
Level 1: List the ways in which germs are 
spread to humans or animals

The environment is made up of people, plants and animals 
that live and coexist together.  
 
The environment provides water, air, sunshine, trees and 
plants that people need to live. These are called natural 
resources because they are found in nature.  
 
Clean water is important for drinking, bathing and 
performing daily chores. 
 
Air is essential for life and good health.    
 
Animals provide various sources of food, clothing, shelter 
and companionship. 
 
Trees and plants – provide food, homes and shade for 
people and animals and give off oxygen that helps them 
breathe. 
 
Keeping the environment clean is important to good health. 
Level 1: List ways to keep the 
environment clean. 
 
Choose one of the natural resources and 
draw pictures of how it is beneficial to

APPENDIX II 
 
 
TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices, and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, values and 
attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. However, 
teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit grades which will 
contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. (sharing 
thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills) 
• Field trips 
• Internships 
• Community Services 
 
Assessment Procedures 
 
Students are assessed based on the following: 
 
Class work and Homework   
60% 
 
Projects and Portfolios  
 
40% 


 
75 
Health and Family Life Education Resource / Information Centre 
 
Each classroom should have a resource or information centre in which information on health issues and students’ work are displayed. Health and Family 
Life materials and activities can also be incorporated into the learning centres in primary schools. 
 
Listed are some suggested resources that will make Health and Family Life Education classes more interactive and interesting: 
 
• Computer Software 
• Transparencies on health issues   
• Games and Puzzles  
• Reality dolls 
• Puppets 
• Posters / Charts 
• Videos, DVDs and Audio Cassette tapes on health issues 
• Pamphlets  
• Brochures  
• Guest Speakers  
• Media sources  
 
Health and Family Life Education Services 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit provides the following services in New Providence and the Family Islands. 
 
• Workshop and sensitization sessions for teachers, parents, students and the public 
• Resources on health issues 
• Peer leadership training 
• HIV Prevention and Basic First Aid training  
 
Partnerships 
 
The Health and Family Education Unit collaborates with parents, school personnel, Government and Non-Government organizations to provide 
wholesome programmes for students. These activities are designed to help them gain the required knowledge, skills, values and attitudes so that they will 
graduate from the education system as fully functioning, self-confident, responsible individuals.

APPENDIX III 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will be time 
for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, role play, 
games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication, 
negotiation, assertiveness and cooperation. 
 
12. Ensure that grades are recorded in the mark book for the topics taught (date, topic, and number grade) 
 
13. Establish interactive learning centres in the classroom which should include current teaching aids and samples of students’ activities.  
 
14. Create instructional and motivational bulletin boards/charts that reflect the concepts and skills being taught e.g. family patterns, body parts, hygiene, 
drug abuse prevention, conflict resolution, HIV, AIDS STIs,  nutrition, environment issues, self-esteem, teamwork, etc.

TEACHING GOOD VALUES AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP 
 
 
Dr. Marian Bock, Director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle’s Virtues Project, defines virtues as universal positive character traits. She defines 
values as agreements, rules, principles, codes and beliefs about how to practice these virtues. Bock recommends integrating fifty-two universal virtues 
into appropriate family life classes by encouraging students to recognize them in themselves and others.

health and the choices they 
make in everyday life. 
 
The Personal and Social 
Curriculum focused on 
developing the personality 
in its entire dimension: 
physically, intellectual and 
emotional.

and resources) 
The curriculum will contain an over-arching goal.  The sub-goals (standards) and objectives (benchmarks) 
will be related to the over-arching goal. 
Scope and Sequence 
Provides an overview of what is to be 
taught and learnt at each level of the 
student’s development 
A Scope of Sequence Chart will be included for grades 1-6, which will be based on the four major themes 
in the CARICOM HFLE Framework: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, Sexuality and Sexual Health, 
Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. 
Scope of Work

PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
 
The new direction of Physical Education at Primary level is to provide all students with a safe, enjoyable and nurturing environment where physical activity and the 
development of motor skills will be enhanced.  Each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her potential through the acquisition of knowledge, and skills 
that will transfer to a healthy lifestyle and lifelong sports.  The base of the Physical Programme is Body Management Competence, which gives focus to the development of 
fundamental skills that lead into specialized skills training.  Primary students will also participate in the core sports such as Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, Soccer 
and Track and Field.   Interschool competitions take place in all of the “core sports” aforementioned including, Mini- tennis.  It is the responsibility of the New Providence 
Primary School Sports Association in collaboration with the Department of Education and the various Sports Factions to organize and conduct the competitions, 
reinforcing the principles of fair play, sportsmanship and self-control. 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 
Learn skills necessary to perform a variety of physical activities. 
2. 
Recognize the values and benefits from involvement in physical activity. 
3. 
Become physically fit. 
4. 
Become a life-long participant in regular physical activities.

GRADING SYSTEM FOR PRIMARY PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
Grading system to be used: 
Each child will start each term with 100% 
Deduction will be made for failure to: 
1. Change for class as required. 
2. Show a good attitude. 
3. Come to class on time without proper excuse. 
4. To participate in class. 
5. To complete assignments. 
6. No end of term exam shall be given; there is a written test and practical test after every unit. 
Every child is to participate in Physical Education, only a Doctor’s request will excuse a child. In this case the child can do a project to ensure he/she receives a grade. 
 
Allocation of time: 
Grade 1-3 should now be scheduled for ½ Hour Twice (2 times) per week. 
Grade 4-6 shall continue to have P.E. once (1 time) per week.

CONTENT STANDARDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
1. Demonstrates competency and proficiency in movement forms. 
The intent of this standard is to develop competence and proficiency in movement.  In preparation for adulthood, students should have acquired the basic skills to 
participate in a wide variety of leisure and work- related physical activities and advance in at least two or three areas. 
 
2. Apply movement concept and principles to learning and development of motor skills. 
This standard concerns the ability of the learner to use cognitive information to understand and enhance motor skills.  By graduation the student should have developed 
sufficient knowledge and ability to independently use their learned behavior to acquire new skills while continuing to refine existing ones. 
 
3. Exhibits physically active lifestyles. 
The intent of this standard is to establish patterns of regular participation in meaningful physical activity.  This standard should connect what was done in physical 
education classes with the lives of students outside of class. 
4. Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 
This standard is for the student to achieve a health-enhancing level of physical fitness.  Student should be encouraged to develop higher levels of basic fitness and 
physical competence as needed for many work situations and active leisure participation.  Students should have both the ability and the willingness to accept 
responsibility for personal fitness leading to an active, healthy lifestyle. 
 
5. Demonstrates responsible personal and social behaviors in physical activity settings. 
Achievement of this standard includes safe practices, adherence to rules and procedure, etiquette, cooperation and teamwork, and positive social interaction. 
 
6. Show respect for differences among people in physical activity settings. 
The intent of this standard is to develop respect for individual similarities and differences through positive interaction among participants in physical activity.  
Similarities and differences include characteristics of culture, ethnicity, motor performance, disabilities, physical characteristics (strength, size, and shape), gender, race 
and socioeconomic status.  
 
7. Recognize that physical activity opportunities are for enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. 
As a result of these intrinsic benefits of participation, students will begin to actively pursue lifelong physical activities that meet their own needs.

By the end of  Grades  1  - 2  
the students will be able to: 
 
- 
Demonstrate the 
different starting 
positions. 
 
- 
Display proper 
running Techniques. 
 
- 
Demonstrate the 
difference between 
running, sprinting, 
walking, striding and 
jogging. 
 
SPRINTS 
- 
Sprinting ranges from the 50 meters the 
400 meters.  Sprinting consists of two 
basic principles: stride length and stride 
speed.  There are three parts of effective 
sprinting: the start, efficient running form, 
and the finish.  Each of these basic parts of 
the total sprint effort has essential 
demands.  Sprinting form is a very 
individual matter because of differences in 
body builds. However, fundamental 
running movements can be portrayed in 
general terms of correct foot placement, 
arm action, shoulder and head angles, body 
alignment, and leg and knee action. 
 
FOOT PLACEMENT 
- 
Emphasize the toes pointing straight 
ahead, as opposed to in or out, for efficient 
running. 
ARM ACTION 
- 
Arms are used for balance 
- 
Thumbs should be relaxed 
- 
The arm moves driving the elbow forward 
and back, never passing higher than the 
armpit on the forward swing and never 
further than six inches beyond the hips. 
- 
Arms never cross the midline of the body.

- 
The shoulder should be relaxed with little 
or no rotation. 
 
HEAD 
- 
The head should be straight ahead with 
eyes focused on the finish line. 
- 
The face (jaws and facial muscles) should 
be relaxed. 
 
BODY ALIGNMENT 
- 
The student should rise up on his or her 
toes and lean forward to where a position 
of balance is barely maintained, that is the 
correct body angle.  Forward angle is best 
when accelerating. 
 
LEG ACTION AND KNEE LIFT 
- 
Knees should come up close to parallel and 
straight ahead. Do not permit knees to 
rotate in or out. 
-

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them with the 
necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an independent, ever-changing world. 
Visual Arts Unit 
Vision 
We envision an art education programme in which all students in The Bahamas are guided toward literacy, an appreciation of Artists, craft persons, and Bahamian 
culture. We also envision an art education programme that is comprehensive and will nurture the spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, creative, imaginative, aesthetic, 
social and physical wellbeing of the child. 
Mission Statement 
Our mission is to advance art education through appropriate curriculum, teacher development programmes, stimulating environments, the provision of materials and 
relevant information. By doing so, we provide students with learning experiences that focus on their creative development, aesthetic appreciation, critical thinking and 
cultural awareness as well as inter-disciplinary integration. 
Belief Statement 
Art education is beneficial to all students regardless of social, ethnic, economic or educational background. Art is an integral part of the overall educational development 
of the student as it compliments and unites other disciplines while promoting visual literacy skills, imaginative thinking and visual communication. 
We further believe that: 
• Art education provides students with the means to think critically, experience, and understand the world around them in unique ways. 
• Art enables students to become self-directed and lifelong learners. 
• Art provides learning opportunities of varying abilities. 
• Art education enhances the ability to interact in society by developing creative problem solving, inquiry, and communication skills, and by providing an avenue 
for self-expression and multiple points of view. 
• Students develop attitudes of appreciation, self-worth, joy in the creation of artworks, and in viewing the works of other students and artists. 


4 
 
 
 
• Art is a way to appreciate the beauty and value of the environment and the preservation of our heritage. 
• Art provides opportunities to exhibit in classrooms, schools, art centres and museums, sharing the art curriculum with the community, teachers, students, and 
examiners. 
• Art education increases awareness of career possibilities, promotes entrepreneurial skills and highlights our community’s visual resources. 
• Art education reflects and influences the cultural, social, political and economic aspirations and concerns of our society. 
• Art is a way to appreciate differences and promotes cultural, social and ethnic similarities.
