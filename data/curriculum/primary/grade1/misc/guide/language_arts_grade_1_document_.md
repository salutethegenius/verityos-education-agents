PREFACE 
 
 
To assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum, several strategies were employed.  The process 
began with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions.  These countries included 
Jamaica, the United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois) Canada and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 
guides).  The documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their 
rationale and philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as 
well as the Scope of Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa 
and several other countries were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of 
English and the Ministry of Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.    
 
Opportunities were also provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers 
throughout The Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen 
teachers throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students in order to get 
their feedback on what they wanted to learn about and the types of learning activities that they enjoyed.  Additionally, a 
focus group was conducted with members from the community that included business owners, parents and those who 
interact with students in after school clubs and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary teachers, one preschool teacher and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment 
Section.  Opportunities were also provided for several of the Family Island teachers to submit content and activities 
through the Education Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time 
engaged in research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction in order to meet the needs 
of their students.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
The revision of the 2022-2027 Curriculum Guidelines would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication 
of a number of committed teachers, officers, administrators, and community stakeholders.  The Language Arts Unit is 
especially grateful to the Curriculum Team members who worked long hours to ensure that this document was completed.  
Special acknowledgement is given to the late Verona Seymour, who served as an Assistant Director of Education for the

BELIEF STATEMENTS   
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student centered; 
2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make decisions as well as to develop self- 
confidence and greater freedom of expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. Thinking, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme 
and should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing 
sixth grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our 
students receive at the primary level, lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that 
students are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on the communication skills.  During this particular period in our history, knowledge of the basic 
communication skills is essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalization of everyday services.  More and 
more people are being pushed to use on-line services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct 
banking transactions, to pay bills, to make travel arrangements, to access government services and so much more.   
Additionally, changes in technology demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Land lines, 
that only required listening and speaking skills for its use, have been replaced with smart phones and computers where 
we can communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the 
internet, buy tickets, post to Facebook, create blogs, Snapchat, conduct and participate in meetings from anywhere in the 
world and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be that confidence in our education system that students 
will be prepared to communicate effectively in spite of the changes that occur.  Recognizing that the Language Arts skills 
are the foundation of all learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on 
producing students who are not only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability 
to communicate effectively in a rapidly advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves 
creatively, to collaborate and to problem solve as we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable goal 4, which 
speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education for all...”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of 
Oracy, Reading and Writing, teachers will have the tools in their hands to equip students with the fundamental skills that 
they will need to become life-long learners and to navigate successfully in an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM  
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, 
teachers should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area 
subjects and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual fieldtrips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centers, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level in order to provide teachers and parents with a guide 
for what students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This 
information should be used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also provides an 
indication of the level of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become 
proficient in a particular area, teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted in 
order to make them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the 
end of the course of study.  Teachers should be guided by the content which indicates what students should know 
or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading 
(Phonemic Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar and 
Composition Writing). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds 
on the previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided 
into three categories:  basic, intermediate and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can 


Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 1 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                                      20 
 
access content and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels if they find it necessary to do so, in order to 
meet the needs of their students.   
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of 
opportunities should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with 
various audiences.  They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large 
group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative 
projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary 
safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with 
students.  Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  In order to avoid 
duplication in the curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best 
applied.  It is expected that once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the 
strands and that they can be assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught the Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This 
particularly refers to reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be 
highlighted.  Students are to be exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are 
taught through teacher read-alouds and independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade 
level. 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels and Science Fiction 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading and after reading. 
 
 
 
 


Bahamas Ministry of Education – Grade 1 Primary Language Arts Curriculum 2022-2027                                                                                                                                      21 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening   
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in the area of reading still 
have opportunities to understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (through the use of pictures, video 
clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions    
as students connect skills to their everyday experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle  
the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing to see if students have mastered the skill is to have them  
incorporate it in a writing exercise.  This will give them an opportunity to apply what they have learnt.  Students who 
are able to apply reading skills, would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy.  Following this      
method of teaching the comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into  
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as 
ends in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and 
Handwriting; however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in 
the case of Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should 
only be scored for what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week the number of 
items on the checklist should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the 
checklist should be continually reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been 
generated.  Students should be aware of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to 
assess their own writing before it is even submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, 
mechanics and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three 
lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of 
grade two cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will 
be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, 
and words from the grade level word list included in the appendices of this document.

When speaking, ensure that others 
can understand what is being said 
without having to strain to hear.   
 
To avoid mumbling, do the following: 
 Use lips, tongue and teeth 
when speaking.   
 Pronounce the words clearly. 
 Include all the endings. 
 Slow down your words. 
 Keep breathing so that you do 
not run out of air. 
 
The volume of our voice should be 
suitable for the location. Sometimes 
we may have to be silent, whisper, 
talk quietly, speak in a medium-loud 
voice, speak loudly or scream 
depending on where we are and the 
situation. 
Church – silence 
Funeral Parlour – whisper or talk 
quietly

The print is sometimes 
recognized because of the 
shapes, pictures and colours 
surrounding the print.  
Some examples are:   
 
Street Signs: 
Stop 
Pedestrian crossing 
Slow 
Caution 
 
Signs to Access Places:

Segmentation is breaking a 
word into its separate 
phonemes (beginning, 
medial, and ending) and 
saying each phoneme as it 
is tapped out, counted, or 
signalled. 
 
Example:  
The word ‘pan’ has three (3) 
individual sounds. 
 
/p/ /a/ /n/ 
 
The word ‘desk’ has four (4) 
individual sounds: 
 
/d/ /e/ /s/ /k/ 
 
 
Basic:  Model examples of how 
to segment a word using finger 
puppets, tapping, clapping or 
stomping. Have students 
practice segmenting the words 
using the same methods. 
 
Intermediate:  Show students 
picture cards. Have students say 
how many sounds (phonemes) 
are heard in the word, then give 
the sounds (beginning, medial 
and ending).  
 
Advanced:  Place three chairs 
in the front of the class.  
Distribute letter cards to 
students. Segment words. As 
the sounds (phonemes) are 
heard, students will take a seat 
in the chair representing the 
position in which their letter 
sound is heard.  Have the class 
determine if the students sit in 
the correct chairs. 
 
 
Have students segment words.

Phoneme blending is 
listening to a sequence of 
separately spoken sounds 
(phonemes) and then 
combining the sounds 
(phonemes) to form a word. 
 
Example:  
The sounds /l/ /i/ /d/ make 
the word ‘lid’ when blended. 
 
Basic:  Using objects in the 
classroom, say the sounds for 
the name of an object in a 
segmented fashion.  Have 
students identify the object by 
combining the sounds. 
(Example: /d/ /e/ /s/ /k/ would be 
desk). 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
use letter cards/tiles to blend 
phonemes together for the 
names of the pictures displayed. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
participate in the activity 
‘baseball.’ Divide the class into 
two teams.  The pitcher (teacher) 
says aloud a word in parts, such 
as /p/e/n/.  If the child who is ‘at 
bat’ can blend the phonemes 
correctly, he/she goes to first 
base.  Play just as in baseball, 
with each team earning a point 
when a child makes it to home 
plate. 
 
 
Have students blend sounds to 
read words.

it.   
 
Example: the ‘all’ in ball or 
the ‘ack’ in black.  
 
A rhyme is when two words 
have the same, or very 
similar, final sounds. 
  
Words that usually rhyme 
have the same rime.  
 
Example: ball and fall.  
  
However, words with 
different rimes can rhyme

Resources 
Consonants are the letters in the 
alphabet that are not vowels. 
The consonants are: b, c, d, f, g, 
h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, 
x, y, and z. 
  
Consonants can appear at the 
beginning, in the middle or at the 
end of words. 
  
Consonants usually represent 
one sound.  However, there are 
some consonants that have two 
sounds like g, c and x. 
 
When teaching the letter q and 
the /kw/ sound, remember that q 
is almost always followed by u in 
English words.   
  
(Please note that for advanced 
students you may introduce 
three letters in a week, average 
students 2 letters and the more 
challenged students 1 letter.  As 
students build their repertoire of 
letters, each letter sound taught 
should be reviewed daily.) 
Basic:  Play the game ‘Odd One Out’. 
Have students listen to words in a 
series to identify the word whose 
beginning sound is different.  
(This activity can be used for middle 
and final consonants as well.)  
   
Intermediate:  Have students sort 
pictures according to beginning 
or ending sounds.  
   
Advanced:  Using a worksheet, have 
students write the missing consonant in 
words for given pictures.  
  
Please note that this activity can be 
digitized using Live Worksheets or 
Teacher-Made Google Forms/Microsoft 
Forms  
 
 
Have students complete a 
worksheet where they 
match letters to pictures 
whose names make their 
sounds.

Objective 2.13: Identify short vowel sounds in words (cvc, vc and ccvc patterns). 
Content 
Suggested 
 Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
A vowel is a speech sound 
which is produced without any 
closure or obstruction by the 
tongue, lips or teeth of air flow. 
The letters a, e, i, o and u are 
vowels. 
  
Short Vowels – CVC pattern 
CVC stands for consonant - 
vowel - consonant.  A vowel is 
usually short when it appears 
between two consonants in a 
one syllable word.   
Examples: /bat/, /sip/, /pen/ 
  
VC pattern 
VC stands for vowel - 
consonant. When a single 
vowel letter in a word or syllable 
is followed by a consonant 
letter, digraph, or blend, it 
usually makes its short sound.  
Examples:  /at/, /it/, /up/ 
 
 
Basic:  Give students a set of counters 
and picture cards whose names have 
short vowel sounds.  Have students say 
the name of their picture and listen to the 
number of sounds heard in the word.  Ask 
students to place that number of counters 
on their picture card.   
  
Intermediate:  Distribute vowel cards to 
students.   Say a word with a short vowel 
sound. Have students repeat the word 
and then hold up the correct letter card 
for the vowel sound heard in the word.  
  
Advanced:  Have students participate in 
a picture sort.   Divide students into 
groups. Give each group various pictures 
and have them place the cards under the 
correct vowel according to the sound.  
(Example: The picture of the ‘cat’ will be 
placed under short vowel a.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Show the class various 
pictures that have short 
vowel sounds and have 
them call the picture 
names.  Have the 
children write the vowel 
sound heard in each 
picture name.

Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
Long Vowel:  
An open phoneme (speech 
sound) in which there is no 
obstruction by the tongue, lips or 
teeth of air flow.  
 
CVCE pattern - CVCE stands for 
consonant - vowel -consonant 
- final e.  In a one syllable word 
that has the CVCE pattern, the 
first vowel is usually long and 
the ‘e’ is silent.   
Examples: /rake/, /dime/, /nose/.  
 
CVVC pattern- CVVC stands for 
consonant - vowel - vowel - 
consonant. VV refers to two 
adjacent vowels.  Two adjacent 
vowels- When two vowels 
appear together in a word, the 
first vowel usually gives its long 
sound and the vowel that follows 
is silent.  
Examples: /meat/, /coat/, /tail/ 
 
 
 
Basic:  Display a short 
poem/rhyme. Have students 
circle or underline CVCE / 
CVVC words in the 
poem/rhyme.  
  
Intermediate:  Let students 
participate in the activity 
‘Rhyming Tic-Tac-Toe’ using 
long vowels.  Each of the 
boxes on the game board 
should contain a word that 
has a long vowel sound.  
Have students choose a 
square on the game board.  
If they provide a rhyming 
word with a long vowel 
sound to correctly match the 
word in the given box, they 
can write or place an X or O 
in the box. The regular rules 
of Tic-Tac-Toe can be 
followed. 
  
Advanced:  Have students 
create word flip books with 
long vowel phonograms. 
(Example: /ake/, /eet/, /oat/) 
Have students complete 
sentences using long 
vowel words.  Have them 
indicate the long vowel 
sound that is heard.

Resources 
Sight words and high 
frequency words are words 
that are very common 
(encountered frequently) in 
print and used in writing).  
Sight words can sometimes 
be difficult to decode. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students play the game 
‘Simon Says’ using sight words.  Give a 
sight word to each child.  Teacher calls a 
word and names an action.  Child with 
the word called performs the action. 
Example: Simon says “it” must clap four 
(4) times. 
  
Intermediate:  Play game ‘Wordo’ 
(similar to the game Bingo).  Have 
students write sight or high frequency 
words in blocks on a Wordo sheet. 
Distribute markers.  Have students place 
a marker on words as they are called one 
at a time.  The first student to have a 
complete row covered wins. 
  
Advanced:  From a group of high 
frequency word cards, have students 
select words to form sentences.  Ask 
them to read and write the sentences 
formed. 
 
 
 
 
 
Give students sentences 
with the words being 
taught.  Have students 
circle the word that is 
called in each sentence.

the word and then tap out the syllables in 
the word. 
  
Intermediate:  Choose students whose 
names have one, two, three or four 
syllables to stand in the classroom.  Have 
other students take turns saying their 
names and figuring out which name has 
the same number of syllables as theirs.  
Ask them to stand behind that person 
with the same number of syllables in 
his/her name.

A consonant blend is two or 
more consonants together in 
which the speech sounds of 
all consonants are heard. 
Blends to be taught are L-
blends, S-blends and R-
blends. 
  
Examples:  
/fl/ – flower 
/sl/ – slow 
/br/ – brush

cards.  Have students place the pictures 
under the blend heard in each picture’s 
name.    
 
Intermediate:  Provide students with a 
list of blends.  Have them pronounce the 
blend.  Allow them to practice saying the 
blend followed by different vowel 
sounds.  Have them read complete 
words with the blends. 
 
Advanced:  As each blend is 
introduced, have students read 
sentences that incorporate words with 
that blend.  Have students practice 
reading the sentences daily.  Include a 
mix of previously taught blends and 
blends that are currently being taught in 
the sentences for continuous 
reinforcement.

A consonant digraph is two 
adjacent consonants in a 
word that produce only one 
sound. Consonant digraphs 
can be found at the 
beginning, middle or end of 
words. 
  
Examples:  
/th/ – thin, teeth 
  
/sh/ – shut, flash 
  
/ch/ – church, lunch 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  As the digraphs are introduced, 
have students say the sound and words 
that contain the digraphs.  Once 
students are comfortable with the sound 
of a particular digraph, have them read 
other simple words that contain that 
sound. 
 
Intermediate:  In pairs have students 
find, then draw and label objects in the 
classroom that contain digraphs.  Have 
them read the words and incorporate 
them into a sentence. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
sentences that contain the digraph that 
is being introduced.  As new digraphs 
are studied, incorporate them in 
sentences along with the ones that were 
previously studied.  Have students 
practice reading the sentences daily.

Resources 
An inflectional ending is a 
letter or group of letters 
added to a base word to 
change its meaning. 
  
Examples: 
-ing: The ending –ing added 
to a word tells about 
something that is happening 
now. 
(Example: The children are 
playing.) 
  
-ed: When –ed is added to 
the end of a word, it tells of 
something that happened in 
the past. 
(Example: The boy walked 
home from school.) 
 
Basic:  Give each student two index cards. 
Have them write -ing on one and -ed on the 
other.  Call a word and instruct them to hold 
up the card for the ending that they hear at the 
end of the word that is said.

passage that contains inflectional endings.   
Have students circle words with inflectional 
endings.  Have them read the words. 
  
Advanced:  Have students complete a word 
sort by grouping words about the present and 
words that talk about the past.  Let them use 
words from their reading textbooks and the

Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
There are certain punctuation marks that give 
cues as to how a particular sentence should 
be read. 
 
Period – Pause and take a breath before 
reading the next sentence.   
(Example: Ma is baking bread today.) 
 
Comma – Give a slight pause when there is 
a comma.  Reading too fast or too slowly can 
change the meaning of a sentence. 
(Example: Auntie Mae, mommy sent me for 
the flour.) 
 
Question Mark – The voice is normally 
raised at the end of a sentence when there is 
a question mark. This indicates that a 
response may be required.   
(Example: Would you like to have some 
bread?) 
 
Exclamation – When there is an 
exclamation mark, the reading must be 
completed with a certain emotion.   
(Example: This bread is hot!) 
Basic:  Read aloud to students so 
that they can hear how a 
particular piece should be read. 
Use a chant or poem.  Have 
students model it. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with a written copy of a recorded 
reading.  Point out the 
punctuation marks.  Have pupils 
listen to the piece being read 
especially as it pertains to the 
punctuation marks.   Have 
students imitate the person on the 
recording as it is played a second 
time. 
 
Advanced:  Place students in 
pairs.  Have them listen to each 
other reading while focusing on 
the visual clues.  Have students 
record each other until they are 
satisfied with their recordings.

Assessment 
Resources 
To make what is being read interesting to 
others, it is important to vary our volume, 
pace and pitch to match what is 
happening in the passage.   
 
Volume – Refers to how loud or how soft 
something is read.  When reading to an 
audience, the voice should be clear and 
loud so that everyone can hear.  The 
voice may change according to who is 
speaking.  Something may be read loudly 
– for instance, if a great big giant is 
speaking or if someone is angry.  A piece 
may be read softly when a person is 
whispering or trying to sneak up on 
someone. 
 
Pace – This refers to how fast or how 
slowly something is read.  When there is 
excitement or fear in the story, it can be 
read faster.  If there is sadness in the 
piece it may be read more slowly. 
 
Pitch – This refers to how high or low the 
voice is.  If a cute baby is speaking, the 
voice would be higher than if a man is 
speaking.  
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students read 
familiar nursery rhymes.  
 
Intermediate:   Have students 
read a particular text using 
different voices to reflect different 
characters and moods:  game 
announcer, baby, robot, lion, 
anger, sadness, happiness, etc. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
text that can be converted into a 
news story.  Pupils can report 
class or school news.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use a rubric to assess for 
pacing, intonation and 
expression as students 
read.

Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
The people or animals in a story 
are the characters. When reading 
a story, you can discover what 
characters look like, what they 
think, how they feel and what they 
say and do. 
  
A story usually has a beginning, 
middle, and an end.  Every story 
has a problem.  This is called the 
plot. 
  
When and where a story takes 
place is called the setting.  The 
setting can be a real or a make- 
believe place. 
 
Basic:  Before reading, give each 
student story cards with the words 
‘character’, ‘setting’ and ‘plot’ 
written on them.  Reread parts of a 
familiar story or book.  During the 
readings, have students raise the 
correct card to identify the story 
element.  For example, when you 
say a character’s name, the 
students will raise the character 
card.  
  
Intermediate:   Have students 
recall the character, setting and 
plot from a familiar Disney movie 
or Bahamian fable.  
 
Advanced:   Have students cut 
out pictures from old magazines 
news or download them from 
online.  Have students use these 
to tell their own simple stories 
involving characters, settings and 
plot.  Have students share their 
stories with the class and discuss 
the characters, setting and plot. 
 
 
 
The students will read a story 
and complete a story map.  
Identify the elements of a story 
by writing the story elements 
or drawing the elements for 
each section.

Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
Clues are sometimes given to 
help us understand the meaning 
of hard or difficult words.  These 
clues may be picture clues or 
words in the sentence. 
 
Picture Clues – Sometimes there 
are pictures of the difficult words 
to help readers.  Once readers 
can identify what is happening in 
the pictures, they can understand 
the words. 
 
Prior Knowledge – Readers must 
sometimes use their own 
knowledge and experiences along 
with the clues in the passage to 
figure out the meanings of words.   
Basic:  Show the meaning of 
unfamiliar words using pictures.  
Discuss them with students. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
read a sentence where picture 
clues are given to help them 
understand the meanings of 
unfamiliar words.  Have them 
discuss what they think the 
words mean. 
 
Advanced:  Introduce new 
words to students.  To assist 
them in understanding the new 
words, place them in context by 
relating them to students’ 
experiences. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students complete a 
worksheet where they must 
use the clues provided in order 
to complete sentences.

When making predictions, 
readers must think about clues 
the author has given along 
with what they already know to 
make a good guess as to what 
will happen next. 
 
As readers follow the story, 
their ideas of what may 
happen next might change. 
 
Basic:  Role play a familiar scene like the 
school bell ringing at the start of the day.  
Ask students what will happen next.  Have 
them make their predictions.  Relate it to 
what happens when we read.

Resources 
Things that happen in a 
story follow a specific order. 
Knowing the order helps the 
reader to understand and 
remember the story.  Clue 
words such as ‘first’, ‘next’, 
and ‘last’ help the reader to 
understand the order in 
which certain events 
happened. 
  
Words such as ‘morning’, 
‘night’ and ‘evening’ also 
tell the order in which events 
happened. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Provide students with 
picture cards.  Ask them to put the 
pictures in the correct sequence in 
order to tell the story 
  
Intermediate:  Use a digital 
camera and record someone 
cooking/making something.  Take 
snapshots of each step in the 
process as well.  Have students 
view the recording.  Then provide 
students with the snap shots.  Ask 
students to put them in the order 
in which the events happened.  If 
you do not have access to a digital 
camera, record a cooking show 
from the television.  You can also 
draw the steps if you are unable to 
provide photos.

Authors sometimes use their 
imaginations to help them 
write interesting stories.  
Stories about fairies, talking 
animals and objects are not 
real. We call these types of 
stories make-believe. 
  
Books that give us 
information about a person’s 
life, things that actually 
happened and places that 
people can actually visit are 
considered real life. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students look at pictures 
and clap if they are showing real-life or 
stand if they are showing something 
make-believe.  Have students explain 
their responses.

Resources 
A fact is a statement that can be 
proven true or false.  This may be 
done through further reading, 
observation or by asking an 
expert. 
  
Example: “There are 30 students 
in my class.” 
 
This is a statement of fact.  It can 
be proven true or false by 
counting the number of students. 
 
An opinion tells what someone 
thinks or feels about a particular 
subject. As a result, it cannot be 
proven true or false. 
  
Words that tell how someone 
feels such as ‘thinks’ or ‘likes’ 
can be used to tell opinions. 
 
Example: “My teacher is the best 
in the world.” 
 
This is an opinion because it 
expresses how the person feels 
about his/her teacher.   
 
Basic:  Read a few statements 
to students.  Have them put their 
thumbs up if the statement is a 
fact and put their thumbs down if 
the statement provides an 
opinion. Have students give 
reasons for their responses. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with tangible objects such as a 
doll or truck.  Have them take 
turns providing a statement of 
fact about the object and a 
personal opinion about the 
object. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students 
with simple statements of facts 
and opinions.  Have them 
underline the statements that 
provide facts and circle the ones 
that provide opinions.

Objective 2.52: Draw conclusions. 
Content 
Suggested  
Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
Artists sometimes leave clues to 
help viewers understand the 
message in a picture.  In stories, 
authors use words to give clues.  
Readers will need to put all the 
clues together along with what 
they already know to figure out 
things that the artist or the 
author did not say.       
Basic:  Give out pictures and 
have students tell what is 
happening based on the clues 
and their experience.  Have 
students orally state what clues 
they used in order to come to 
their conclusions.  
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
look at pictures and choose 
from two sentences what is 
happening based on the clues 
given.  After they have made 
their choices, have them share 
which clues helped them to 
make the choices that they did. 
 
Advanced:  Ask students to 
read a short story.  Have them 
write one sentence on a 
graphic organizer that tells 
what is happening based on 
the clues read.  The students 
will then write the clues that 
helped them come to their 
conclusion. 
 
 
 
The students will look at 
pictures or read short 
stories and chose the 
sentence from two or 
three sentences that tells 
what has happened, what 
is happening or what will 
happen based on the 
picture or the clues read.

When writing, it is important to sit 
correctly in front of a leveled writing 
surface like a desk or table.  
 
Feet:  Both feet should be placed flat on 
the floor to aid in balancing the body.  
 
Body:  Sit upright in the chairs facing the 
front. The back should be straight.  
 
Right forearm (for right-handed 
students):  The right forearm almost up 
to the elbow should rest on the table.  
 
Left forearm (for left-handed 
students):  Left-handed students should 
have the entire forearm resting on the 
writing surface.  The paper or book 
should be leveled with the edge of the 
table or slanting slightly upwards at an 
angle of about 15 degrees.  
 
Left-handed students should be 
encouraged to tilt their paper in a 
clockwise direction, bottom corner of the 
paper pointing slightly to the middle of 
the body. 
 
 
Basic:  Using various writing 
materials, have students place the 
materials in the appropriate 
positions to write based on their 
hand dominance (left or right-
handed). 
 
Intermediate:  Have right-handed 
students pick up the paper by the 
upper right-hand corner and hold it 
straight out in from of them.  Have 
students identify the most 
comfortable angle.  Have left-
handed students pick up the paper 
by the upper left-hand corner and 
hold it straight out in front of them.  
Have students identify the most 
comfortable angle.  
 
Advanced:  Have students 
demonstrate the correct posture 
for writing.  Provide them with 
feedback. 
Self Evaluation:  
- Is my paper slanted  
   properly? 
- Are my feet flat on the  
  floor? 
- Do I feel relaxed? 
- Am I sitting up straight 
  and tall?

In order to develop good 
handwriting, it is important to learn 
how to hold the pencil and or 
writing tool correctly.  
 
Correct pencil grip:  
 The pencil should be held 
‘lightly’ between the thumb and 
forefinger with the middle 
finger providing support. 
 The pencil should rest on the 
end joint of the middle finger. 
The other two fingers should 
rest lightly on the paper along 
with the side of the hands.  
 The pencil should rest in the 
hollow between the thumb and 
index finger.   
    
 
(https://www.scoilbarra.ie/correct-pencil-
grip/)  
 
 
Basic:  Using beads of different 
sizes, have students thread beads 
on string/yarn.  This task will assist 
with eye-hand coordination and grip.  
Be sure to observe all safety 
protocols and warn students not to 
put beads in their mouths.  
 
Intermediate:  Practice forming play 
dough.  Use play dough to roll, 
press, and form various patterns. 
This helps with the students’ grip, 
control and thumb flexibility. 
 
Advanced:  Using jumbo crayons/ 
pencils/ or large pieces of chalk, 
have students grip and position the 
writing tool to write given patterns or 
strokes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use jumbo/regular pencils 
to demonstrate correct 
posture and position of the 
pencil.

Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
A sentence is a group of words that 
express a complete idea or 
thought. 
Example: “The hen is brown.” 
 
Sentences should begin with a capital 
letter and end with an end mark. 
There are three different end marks: 
period (.), question mark (?) and 
exclamation point/mark (!) 
 
A fragment is a group of words that 
does not express a complete thought 
or idea and does not make sense. 
Example: “One day the dog.” 
 
Words in a sentence should be 
placed in the correct order to make 
sense. 
Example:  
 
blue hat I a see. ✘ 
 
I see a blue hat.✔ 
 
Basic:  Students will listen to the 
reading of a group of words.  Ask 
students to put their thumbs up if 
it is a sentence and thumbs down 
if it is not a sentence.     
 
Intermediate:  Present a group 
of simple rebus sentences and 
fragments using known sight/high 
frequency words.  Using crayons, 
have students circle the complete 
sentences.    
Example: I see a . 
                    cat 
          
Advanced:  Students will be 
given a mixture of simple 
sentences and fragments.  Have 
students paste the sentences on 
one side of a T-Chart and 
fragments on the other side.        
Have students draw a 
picture and write a 
sentence about it.    
 
If students are unable to 
write sentences 
independently, provide 
students with word cards 
and pictures to be used 
to construct a rebus 
sentence.  
 
Example: 
 
  I see a  .

Objective 3.18: Construct declarative, interrogative, exclamatory and imperative sentences. 
Content 
Suggested  
Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
There are four types of sentences.  
 
A telling sentence tells 
something.  The end mark is 
called a full stop or a period (.)   
It is used at the end of each telling 
sentence.  
 
An asking sentence asks 
something and is also called a 
question.  End an asking 
sentence, or a question, with a 
question mark (?).  Asking 
sentences begin with specific 
words such as can, why, who, 
what, when, where, how and 
will. 
 
An exclamatory sentence shows 
strong feelings such as surprise, 
amusement or annoyance. An 
exclamatory sentence can sound 
like a question, but it does not 
require a response.  It ends with 
an exclamation mark (!). 
Exclamatory sentences can begin 
with words like wow, oh, hooray. 
Basic:  Have students show a 
picture of their favourite pets.  Have 
them tell one or two facts about their 
pets.  Have other students ask 
questions about the pet.  Discuss the 
different types of sentences that 
were used. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students play 
the game ‘Pin It!’.  Post sentences in 
sections of the room.  Issue students 
clothespins labelled with the end 
marks: period, exclamation mark and 
question mark.  Have students read 
sentences in groups of four and pin 
the correct end mark at the end of 
each sentence. 
 
Advanced:  Have students search in 
books, newspapers, flyers, bulletin 
boards, etc. for exclamatory, asking 
and telling sentences.  Have 
students use their tablets to take a 
picture of two examples of each type 
of sentence.   Ask students to share 
and discuss their pictures. 
Complete sentences by 
choosing the correct 
punctuation mark. 
 
Example: 
 Sally has a dog 
 this is my favourite 
book 
 the dog up 
 I like to play in the 
sand. 
 
Write or compose 
different types of

Objective 3.20: Identify different types of nouns. 
Content 
Suggested  
Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
Nouns, also called naming 
words, are words that name a 
person, place, animal or thing.  
 
Example:  
Person: 
girl, boy 
Place: 
park, home 
Animal: 
cat, dog          
Thing: 
cereal, hat   
    
The words above are known as 
common nouns because they do 
not name a particular person, 
place, animal or thing.  
 
Proper nouns name a special 
person, place, animal or thing. 
Proper nouns begin with a capital 
letter.  Days of the week, months 
of the year and holidays are 
proper nouns.  
 
Example:  
Person: 
Tom Smith 
Place: 
Abaco 
Animal: 
Max          
Thing: 
Pops cereal   
 
     
 
Basic:  Provide a simple picture for 
students to look at and discuss.  Ask 
students to locate and name different 
common nouns in the picture.   
 
Intermediate:  Display a colourful 
illustration depicting a place.  Ask 
students to provide special names 
for the people, places and things 
they find in the picture.

sentences that contain common and 
proper nouns.  Have them underline 
the common nouns and circle the 
proper nouns.

Resources 
Pronouns are words that are 
used to replace nouns.  They 
include the following:  
he, she, it, we, they, them, I, you 
and me. 
 
He, she and it are pronouns that 
are often used. They represent 
one person, animal or thing.  
 
I and me are used to talk about 
ourselves. I is always capitalized 
when used as a pronoun.  
 
We and us are plural pronouns. 
They are used when referring to a 
group to which the writer or 
speaker belongs.    
 
They and them are plural 
pronouns that refer to others. 
 
Basic:  Have students play a 
matching game where they will link 
pictures of nouns to appropriate 
pronouns. 
 
Intermediate:  Distribute pronoun 
word cards.   Ask students to listen 
to the reading of short sentences. 
Read each sentence twice.  During 
the second reading, leave out the 
noun by saying, “Blank”.  Have 
students display the pronoun card 
that can be used to replace the noun 
that was deleted.   
 
Examples: 
 Shayla went home. 
 ______ went home. (She) 
 
Advanced:  Have students read a 
short paragraph and then exchange 
underlined nouns for pronouns.  
Have them re-write the sentences.

Suggested  
Activities 
Suggested  
Assessment 
Resources 
There are special ways to say or write 
verbs to tell when something happens.  
For actions that are happening now, 
the present tense is used. For actions 
that have already happened, the past 
tense is used.  
 
Present Tense:             
To show the present tense, -ing can 
be added to a verb to tell that 
something is happening now.   
Example: “She is playing in the park.” 
 
Past Tense: 
To show the past tense, -ed is added 
to tell that something has already 
happened.   
Example: “John worked on his car.” 
Basic:  Have students listen to a 
list of verbs.  Ask students to 
stand if the verb is in the present 
tense and sit if it is not.     
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
sing the nursery rhyme “Hey 
Diddle, Diddle”.  Ask students to 
list all past tense verbs mentioned 
in the nursery rhyme. 
 
Advanced:  Present students with 
a group of sentences on a 
worksheet.  Have students 
choose the correct verb tense to 
complete each sentence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students work 
individually to 
complete sentences 
using the correct verb 
tense.

Assessment 
Resources 
A sentence has two parts: the 
naming part and the telling or 
action part.  
 
The subject of a sentence tells 
who or what the sentence is 
about.   
 
Example: 
The man has a big hat. 
The sentence is about the man.  
 
The predicate of a sentence tells 
about the subject. 
 
Example: 
The man has a big hat. 
 
It can also tell what the subject is 
doing or did.  
 
Example: 
The boy ran all the way to 
school. 
Basic:  Using familiar nursery 
rhymes, have students tell the 
naming parts and the telling parts of 
sentences.  
 
Intermediate:  Have students read a 
sentence and draw a line to separate 
the naming and telling parts. 
 
Advanced:  Using a magnet and a 
string, have students fish for the 
naming or telling parts of a sentence. 
When a part of a sentence is caught, 
a naming or telling part should be 
added by the student for completion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students underline 
the complete subject in 
sentences.

The simple subject is the main 
word in the subject. It tells who or 
what the sentence is about.  
 
e.g. The puppy ran after the boy. 
 
Who ran after the boy? The puppy 
did 
 
The simple predicate is the main 
word in the predicate. It tells what 
the subjects is or does.  
 
e.g. The puppy ran after the boy. 
 
What did the puppy do? It ran.  
Basic:  Place a few action words in a 
bag. Have students take turns 
coming to the front of the class to 
select a word from the bag. Have 
them perform that action. Record a 
sentence on the board that tells 
about the action. Ask students the 
cue questions to have them identify 
the simple subjects and simple 
predicate of the sentences.  
 
Intermediate:  Using rebus 
sentences, have students identify the 
simple subjects and simple predicate 
of the sentences. 
 
Advanced:  Distribute word cards 
that make a sentence. Have those 
students with word cards come to the 
front of the room to form the 
sentence. Once the sentence has 
been made correctly formed, the 
student holding the simple subject 
will sit and the simple predicate will 
dance. Discuss with the class 
whether or not they were correct.  
 
 
 
 
Present students with a 
group of sentences 
(worksheets or white 
board). Have students 
circle the simple subject, 
then colour the circle green 
(or any other colour). Then 
have students draw a 
rectangle around the 
simple predicate, then 
colour the rectangle orange

Basic:  Have students take out 
their rulers.  Tell them that you 
have given them special powers to 
turn letters into capitals.  Display 
various prompts that show 
incidences where words need to 
be capitalized.  Students must then 
wave their “magic” wands and 
state which letter should be 
capitalized and why. You can also

There are four reasons why 
authors write: 
 
1. Writing to tell a story - A 
story can tell about what 
happened to you or 
someone else. 
 
2. Writing to describe – The 
senses are used to tell how 
something looks, feels, 
tastes, sounds or smells. 
 
3. Writing to explain – The 
writer gives information or 
gives directions. 
 
4. Writing to say how you feel 
or what you think about a 
particular topic.

Before beginning to write, it is 
important to stop and get your 
ideas ready for writing.  There are 
several ways to do this. 
 
 Look at or draw pictures 
about the topic.  
 Ask questions like “Who?”, 
“What?”, “Where?” and 
“When?” to help you write 
about your ideas 
 Think about what you 
already know about the 
topic and make a list. 
 Talk to someone about the 
topic. 
 Pick the best ideas about 
which to write. 
 
 
Basic:  Have students draw pictures 
of things that they like to do.  Have 
them choose one of the activities and 
dictate or write a sentence about 
something that is happening in the 
picture.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students make 
clay models or draw pictures of 
members of their family.  Have them 
choose a family member about which 
to write.  Have them ask the 5W 
questions to help them write about 
the person.  
 
Advanced:  Have students make a 
list of things that they do before they 
go to bed.  Have them select one 
about which to write.  Have them ask 
the 5W questions to help write more 
about the activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provide students with a

about what you are writing.  Make 
sure that all the sentences are 
about that topic. 
 
Basic:  Display pictures of furniture, 
animals and fruits.  Have students 
put the pictures that are alike 
together.  Ask them to think of a title 
for each of the three groups.  Explain 
that, when we write, the sentences 
should all be about the topic. Below 
is an example from the animal group:

(on which a main idea 
sentence is written on 
the board.  Give students 
sentence strips that have 
some supporting details 
that pertain to that main 
idea sentence and some 
that do not.  Have 
students select the ones 
that are related to the 
main idea and place 
them under the main 
idea.  Discuss their

When writing, how the story or 
piece begins is very important.  
The writer should try to grab the 
attention of the person who is 
reading the piece right away.   
This can be done in several ways. 
 
 Begin with a question.  
Do you have a dog as a 
pet? 
 Start with lots of action.  
Max the dog gave a loud 
bark and ran quickly to the 
door. 
 Use sound words.  “Bow-
wow,” said the cute, fluffy 
puppy in the little basket. 
 Use a word that 
expresses strong 
feelings or emotions such 
as: 
Ouch!  
Oops!  
Hooray! 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
stories being read that have sound 
words, like “Jack & the Beanstalk” 
and “The Three Billy Goats Gruff”.  
Have them identify the sound words 
in the story.  Ask them to use some 
of the sound words in their stories.  
 
Intermediate:  Present students with 
a topic from one of the social science 
subjects.  Ask them to share what 
they know about that topic.  Have 
them begin a writing piece on the 
topic by asking a “What” or a “Why” 
question.  Have them answer it in 
their writing. 
 
Advanced:  Have students write 
about a very good or very bad day.  
Ask them to begin it with lots of 
action.

Many people can tell the same 
story about an experience, but it 
will be different for each of them 
because they all looked at what 
happened in different ways. 
 
Use words like ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’ and 
‘we’ to tell a story about yourself. 
Basic:  Have two students take turns 
looking at a picture through the long 
tube of a hand towel roll (one really 
close up and the other a little further 
away).  Ask the students to share 
what they think the picture is about.

Poems are a fun way of expressing 
our ideas and thoughts.  They can 
come in many different forms.  
Rhyming Poems: 
In rhyming poems, the words at the 
end of line pairs rhyme. There 
should be about the same number 
of words in the line pairs that rhyme 
so that the flow of the poem is 
consistent.  
  
ABC Poem:  
An ABC poem lists words in 
alphabetical order to create a poem. 
The poem can use all 26 letters of 
the alphabet, or it can use just a 
part of the alphabet, but it is 
important that the words appear in 
alphabetical order.  No letter can be 
skipped in the sequence.  
 
List Poems:  
List poems are written as lists.  
There may simply be a list of words, 
or there may be a common phrase 
in each line.  All the lines must refer 
to the person or thing that the poem 
is about.  
Basic:  Have students listen to 
nursery rhymes and select the 
words that rhyme.  Have students 
create a list of other words that 
rhyme with these words.  Have 
them use these words to create 
poems of their own.

Writing stories is a way of telling 
about something that happened.  
Stories should have a beginning, 
middle and an end.   
 
Stories should tell about animals 
or people that are included in the 
events.  These are called story 
characters.  What did they say?  
How did they look?  Where did 
they go? 
 
Stories should also give an idea of 
where the events are happening. 
At the beach?  In a park?  In the 
mall?  This is called the setting or 
the place where the stories are 
taking place. 
 
Stories should give a problem and 
explain how the problem is solved.  
Basic:  Read a short story to 
students.  Have them identify the 
characters in the story, the place 
where the story takes place and the 
problem that needed to be solved. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students tell a 
story about something exciting that 
happened to them.  Have them state 
who was there, where it happened 
and what the events were that 
happened.  Relate this to what 
should happen when writing a story. 
 
Advanced:  Have students use a 
story outline to tell what happened 
first, next and last.  Have them use 
this to write their stories.  They 
should include details about the 
characters and setting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Have students write a 
story that includes 
character, setting and 
plot.  Use a rubric to 
assess their writing.

In descriptive writing, it is 
important to describe people, 
animals, places, items, etc. in 
such detail that readers can 
picture them in their minds as they 
read.  
Using the senses to help build 
descriptions is key.  Include what 
you can see, feel, taste, smell or 
hear.  
Comparing one thing to another is 
another way of helping with 
descriptions.  
Example: “The man was tall and 
skinny like a flagpole.” 
 
 
Basic:  Have students create a 
“Favourites Book”.  On the cover, 
have them draw a picture of 
their favourite food and identify it on 
the cover.  On each page, have them 
write sensory words related to how it 
looks, sounds, feels, smells and 
tastes.   
Intermediate:  Have students 
compare food to other things.   
Example: 
 The bread was as soft as a 
pillow. 
 The candy was as hard as a 
rock. 
 The Kool-Aid was as sweet as 
cotton candy. 
Advanced:  Have students write 
sentences that include descriptions 
of their favourite foods. 
 
Please note that the activities above can be 
used as separate activities, or all can be 
used to help write the book referred to in 
Activity one.  
 
Provide students with a 
prompt.  Have them write 
sentences that include 
descriptive words related 
to that prompt.

In addition to writing stories and 
describing events or people, there 
is a type of writing that just gives 
directions or provides information. 
We call this type of writing, 
expository writing.  
 
Examples of expository writing 
are: 
 
 Classroom Rules 
 Textbooks 
 Instructions 
 Recipes 
 Flyers 
 Invitations 
 Reports 
 
When providing information, begin 
with a sentence that tells about 
what you will be writing.  Then, 
give the details.  End with a 
sentence that tells about what you 
have just written in another way. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Read examples of expository 
writing to students.  Discuss their 
purpose.  Have students identify 
examples of expository writing in 
their environment. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students write 
about themselves (autobiography). 
 
Advanced:  Have students tell how 
to do some chores at home such as 
washing the dishes, sweeping the 
floor or bathing a pet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provide students with an 
expository prompt.  Have 
them write sentences about 
that prompt.  Use a rubric 
to assess their responses.

An opinion tells how a person 
thinks or feels about a particular 
thing.  Sometimes, writers want to 
convince others to believe the 
same thing that they do. 
 
When writing to persuade, writers 
should state how they feel and 
then provide at least two reasons 
why they feel that way.  They 
should end by saying once again 
how they feel about that particular 
thing. 
 
Basic:  Have students share the 
reasons they have given their 
parents to take them to a particular 
place like the movies or the carnival. 
Connect this to persuasive writing.

“Little Red Riding Hood”.  Discuss 
how the wolf tried to convince Little 
Red Riding Hood that he was her 
grandmother.  Apply this to students’ 
writing.

The Reading Block 
 
The Reading Block for lower primary refers to the 90-minute double period dedicated exclusively for the teaching of reading.  This 
daily instructional block encourages the integration of the five components of reading (phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, 
fluency and comprehension).  Within this block, time should be allocated for guided reading where teachers hear students read in 
small groups as well as individually.   
 
Useful Information about the Teaching of Reading 
 
 
THE READING LEVELS 
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate. 
 
 
Basal Readers 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-leveled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach (reading 
for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate reading 
material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension skills and 
vocabulary skills.

Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journey’s 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
  
The Language Experience Approach 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This approach 
can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an experience for 
students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the board or on chart 
paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the language arts components 
(speaking, listening, writing and reading) and helps the children to see relationships:  
 
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Guided Reading: 
Guided Reading refers to teachers working with students in small groups to provide support in reading and comprehending 
designated texts.     
 
Oral Reading: 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
The checklist can be used to guide the teachers’ observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read orally. 
The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps the 
teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.

Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings in relation to the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, science 
and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialized the subject matter becomes, the more demand for reading 
skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  Lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ ability and interests and be ready to help students find the right books at the right 
time.  Learning Students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can be 
found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage students to 
visit their school libraries.

Important Phonics Rules 
  
 
1. C has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /k/ or /s/.  It is pronounced /k/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in words like 
‘can’, ‘cough’ and ‘cut’.  C makes its soft sound /s/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘cent’, ‘city’ and 
‘cycle’. 
 
2. G has two sounds.  It can be pronounced as /g/ or /j/.  It makes its hard sound /g/ when it is followed by a, o or u as in 
words like ‘gate’, ‘goat’ or ‘got’.  G makes its soft sound /j/ when it is followed by e, i or y as in words like ‘gem’, ‘gills’ or 
‘gym’.  There are some exceptions to this rule as in words like ‘get’, ‘give’ and ‘gift’. 
 
3. The CVC pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel and then another consonant.  When this 
happens, the vowel usually gives its shorts sound.  Examples are words like ‘bed’, ‘man’ and ‘hat’.  
 
4. The Final E or CVCE pattern refers to a syllable that has a consonant followed by a vowel, another consonant and a final 
e.  In instances where this occurs, the first vowel gives its long sound (says its name) and the e is silent.  Examples of 
words that follow this pattern are ‘made’, ‘hole’, ‘cube’ and ‘date’. 
 
5. The CV pattern refers to words that only have one-syllable.  In these two-letter words, the vowel normally gives its long 
sound as in words like ‘go’ and ‘me’.  Some one-syllable words do not follow this pattern as in words like ‘to’ and ‘do’. 
 
6. R-Controlled vowels refer to vowels that are followed by the letter r.  When this happens, the sound of the r usually 
dominates the vowel sound, and the sound that the vowel makes is neither a short or a long sound.  Words like ‘cart’, ‘far’ 
and ‘for’ are examples of the r-controlled sounds. 
 
7. When gh follows ‘i’, the ‘i’ gives its long sound and the ‘gh’ is silent.  ‘Thigh’ and ‘right’ are examples of this rule. 
 
8. In words that begin with kn and wr, only the sound for the second letter is heard.  In the words ‘knot’ and ‘wreck’ the n 
and r sounds are heard. 
                                                                                      Adapted from Language Arts by Gail Tompkins

Vowel Generalizations 
 
The following are some of the most common vowel generalizations. 
 
a. In one syllable words containing two vowel letters (one of which is a final e) the first vowel usually represents a long vowel 
sound, the e is silent. (e.g. kite, bite). 
b. In a one-syllable word that ends with a vowel, the vowel that follows the consonant is usually long (e.g. he, go – open 
syllable). 
c. A vowel is usually short when it appears between two consonants in a one-syllable word (e.g. hat, fox, dig – closed 
syllable). 
d. When i is followed by gh, nd,  or ld, the i usually represents its long sound (e.g. find, child, light). 
e. The vowel o followed by –ld usually has a long sound (e.g. old).  
f. If the only vowel in a word or syllable is an a followed by w, ll and u, the sound of the a is usually that of a short o (e.g. 
wall).  
g. When two vowels appear together in a word, the first vowel usually gives its long sound and the vowel that follows is silent. 
This rule is usually consistent with ai, oa, ee and ay combinations. 
h. Each vowel letter may represent the soft schwa sound often heard in the unaccented syllable (e.g. disappear, telegram). 
i. Y functions as a vowel when it concludes words of more than one syllable (e.g. dad/dy) and it follows a vowel (e.g. day).

Writing Instruction 
 
Daily Written Composition 
The timetable for the Lower Primary Grades provides daily periods for Written Composition instruction with a total of five (5) 
periods weekly.  In some instances, a daily allotment of 30 minutes for written composition may not be feasible; hence, the time 
allotment for instruction is five periods per week.  According to research and best practices being currently used, composition 
writing should follow a balanced literacy approach.    
 
Instructional Strategy: 10 Day Writing Plan   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
The “Ten Day Writing Plan” is a pilot writing model developed to support the daily teaching of written composition. This plan can 
be adapted for use at all primary grades.  It is research based and contains the following components of good writing instruction: 
 
· Mentor Texts 
· Enriching Experiences to Build Background Knowledge 
· Vocabulary Building Activities 
· The Writing Process 
· Writing Instructional Strategies 
- Modeled Writing 
- Interactive Writing 
 
The W.A.V.E is an acronym that is used to indicate what should be included a good piece of writing.  The letters refer to: 
Wonderful Introduction 
Add a Topic Sentence 
Very Specific Detail 
Exciting Ending
