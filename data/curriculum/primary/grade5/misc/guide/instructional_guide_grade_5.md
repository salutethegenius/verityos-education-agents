PREFACE 
 
 
Several strategies were employed to assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum.  The process began 
with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions. These countries included Jamaica, the 
United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois), Canada, and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 guides). The 
documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their rationale and 
philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as well as the Scope of 
Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa and several other countries 
were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of English and the Ministry of 
Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.  
 
Opportunities were provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers throughout The 
Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted to be included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen (116) teachers 
throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students to get their feedback about 
what they wanted to learn and the types of learning activities they enjoyed.  Additionally, a focus group was conducted with 
members of the community that included business owners, parents, and those who interact with students in after-school clubs 
and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary school teachers, one preschool teacher, and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment Section.  
Opportunities were also provided for several Family Island teachers to submit content and activities through the Education 
Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time engaged in 
research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction to meet the needs of their students.

BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. the learning environment should be student-centred; 
2. at each grade level, students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. all students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason, and make decisions as well as develop self-confidence 
and greater freedom of expression; 
5. all students should acquire essential survival skills, enabling them to function well in society; 
6. technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. the methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. thinking, speaking, listening, reading, and writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme and 
should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms, which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing sixth 
grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our students 
receive at the primary level lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that students can 
take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on communication skills.  During this period in our history, knowledge of basic communication skills is 
essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalisation of everyday services.  More and more people are being 
pushed to use online services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct banking transactions, to pay bills, 
to make travel arrangements, to access government services, and so much more.   Additionally, changes in technology 
demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Landlines, that only required listening and speaking 
skills, have been replaced with smartphones and computers that allow us to communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, 
send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the internet, buy tickets, post to social media, create blogs, conduct and 
participate in meetings from anywhere in the world, and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of 
communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be confidence that our education system will prepare students 
to communicate effectively, despite the changes that occur.  Recognizing that Language Arts skills are the foundation of all 
learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on producing students who are not 
only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability to communicate effectively in a rapidly 
advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves creatively, collaborate, and problem solve as 
we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Goal 4, which speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education 
for all…”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of Oracy, Reading, and Writing, teachers will have in their hands the 
tools to equip students with the fundamental skills that they will need to become lifelong learners and to navigate successfully in 
an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM 
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, teachers 
should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area subjects 
and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual field trips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centres, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level to provide teachers and parents with a guide for what 
students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This information should be 
used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also indicates the level 
of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become proficient in a particular area, 
teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted to make 
them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the end of the course of 
study.  Teachers should be guided by the content, which indicates what students should know or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading (Phonemic 
Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar, and Written 
Composition). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds on the 
previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided into three 
categories:  basic, intermediate, and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can access content 
and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels, as they find it necessary to meet the needs of their students.   
 


25 
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of opportunities 
should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with various audiences.  
They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large group settings.  ZOOM, 
TEAMS, and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative projects to be organized with 
students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary safety protocols have been put in 
place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with students.  
Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  To avoid duplication in the 
curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best applied.  It is expected that 
once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the strands and that they can be 
assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This particularly refers to 
reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be highlighted.  Students are to be 
exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are taught through teacher read-alouds and 
independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade level. 
 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales, and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics, and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels, and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading, and after reading. 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening 
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in reading still have opportunities to 


26 
 
understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (using pictures, video clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio 
clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions as students connect skills to their everyday 
experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing if 
students have mastered the skill is to have them incorporate it into a writing exercise.  This will allow them to apply what 
they have learned.  Students who can apply reading skills would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy.  
Following this method of teaching comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated 
into the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling, and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as ends 
in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting; 
however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in the case of 
Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should only be scored for 
what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week, the number of items on the checklist 
should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the checklist should be continually 
reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been generated.  Students should be aware 
of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to assess their writing before it is even 
submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, mechanics, and handwriting/presentation. 
Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three lines until their fine motor skills are more developed 
and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of grade two, cursive handwriting can be introduced if 
students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, and 
words from the grade-level word list included in the appendices of this document.

communicate using a variety of media. 
 
Objective 1.1 Display the characteristics of a good listener. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A good listener is someone who 
engages in active listening. Good 
listeners strive to understand the total 
meaning of a communicated 
message.   
  
During informal settings, a good 
listener:    
 maintains eye contact;  
 shows empathy;  
 respects the opinions of others;  
 repeats key information when 
appropriate to do so to show 
understanding;  
 uses non-verbal communication 
(nod of head etc.) to show that 
he/she is listening; and  
 asks questions at the appropriate 
times.  
  
 
Basic:   Divide students into 
groups.  Have them identify 
one characteristic of a good 
listener.  Ask them to place a 
member of their group in a 
pose that reflects that particular 
characteristic.  Have the other 
students use the clues to 
determine which characteristic 
is being portrayed.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
view a recording of a church 
service or some other similar 
gathering.  Freeze various 
frames.  Have students identify 
those individuals who are 
exhibiting characteristics of 
good listeners.  
 
 
  
Have students 
complete an activity 
where they have to 
engage in active 
listening.  Have them 
use a checklist to 
assess themselves on 
how well they listened. 
 Video clips

During formal settings, a good 
listener:    
  
 maintains appropriate posture (sits 
or stands upright.)  
 looks at the person who is 
speaking  
 listens/observes for clues (both 
verbal and non-verbal) that would 
assist in making the message 
clearer  
 respects the opinions of others  
 provides non-verbal cues to let the 
speaker know that he/she is 
listening, making notes etc.   
 asks questions or comments about 
what is being said at the 
appropriate times  
 
 
 
 
 
Advanced:  Ask students to 
use the characteristics of a 
good listener as they complete 
the following activity:   
Provide materials and oral 
instructions for the class on 
how to make a particular item.  
Have students listen to and 
follow the instructions.  Display 
what the item should have 
looked like.  Discuss reasons 
for students’ results, as they 
relate to listening.

 Make and maintain eye contact 
with the people with whom you are 
speaking. 
 Think about the important details 
of the experience to tell about. 
 Tell the events in the order in 
which they happened. 
Basic:  Have students observe 
Bahamian storytellers.  Discuss 
their observations.  Have 
students take turns retelling a 
story, incorporating what they 
have learned.  Have them 
include all the vivid descriptions 
and details. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
take turns talking about their 
experiences at a local eatery.  
Have them describe their meal. 
 
Advanced:  Using information 
from a content area subject, 
have students make an opinion 
statement supported by facts. 
 
Example: “Bahamians are at 
fault for the diminishing conch 
supply.” 
Have students retell a 
story.  Use a rubric to 
assess their retelling.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Standard English is a term applied to 
language that is grammatically correct 
and with no Bahamian Dialect. It 
encompasses grammar, vocabulary, 
pronunciation, and spelling. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can get 
in the way of good communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class or 
with a more formal audience.   
Other occasions could be when 
conducting a class assembly, 
participating in a Christmas play etc. 
 
The Bahamian Dialect can be used when 
speaking in more informal settings like 
with family or friends.  It has its special 
vocabulary as well as a specific way of 
pronouncing words. It includes words 
like: 
 
dey = they 
ta = to 
dat= that 
he’en = he is not 
erry = every 
 
 
In addition to being used in informal 
conversations, the Bahamian dialect is 
often featured in Bahamian songs, 
commercials, plays, and novels. 
Basic:  Show pictures of different 
functions.  Have students 
determine whether it would be 
appropriate to use Standard 
English or Bahamian Dialect. 
Examples:  House of Assembly in 
Session, Junkanoo etc. 
 
Intermediate:  Play clips from a 
radio talk show on a topic to which 
students can relate.  Have 
students determine whether the 
dialect was used appropriately. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
translate the Bahamian Dialect 
into Standard English. 
 
Examples:  
 “I does make up my bed erry 
mornin’.” 
 
 “I make up my bed every 
morning.” 
 
Have students provide 
suggestions for the context in 
which the phrases/sentences 
would be appropriate.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
When speaking, consideration must be 
given to the audience, occasion, and 
location. Sometimes adjustments have to 
be made to our regular speech. 
 
Volume refers to the loudness or softness 
of the speaker’s voice. Be aware of the 
environment and adjust the volume of 
speech accordingly. 
 
Examples: 
 At Junkanoo – very loud 
 At a Fair – loud 
 Near a sleeping baby – whisper/silent  
 
Rate means how fast or how slowly the 
person is speaking.  The rate can vary 
depending on the occasion. When 
speaking ordinarily, speak at a pace 
where people can comfortably understand 
what is being said.  If the person speaks 
too quickly, key information may be 
missed.  If the person speaks too slowly, 
the listeners might lose interest.  When 
speaking for dramatic purposes, the pace 
of speaking can sometimes fluctuate with 
the mood of the piece.  
 
 
Basic:  Have students repeat 
sentences like robots without 
intonation.  Then have students 
say them with proper expression. 
Discuss the impact on 
understanding the message that is 
being communicated. 
 
Intermediate:  Listen to a 
recording of the same song, like 
our National Anthem, by two 
different artists. Discuss how the 
renditions are similar and how 
they differ.  Relate this to the 
different ways in which we 
express ourselves. 
 
Advanced:  Have students watch 
a clip of a motivational speaker 
delivering a message.  Discuss 
the vocal characteristics that 
he/she used and the impact on the 
audience.  Have students write 
short speeches on something 
about which they are passionate.  
Have them deliver the speeches 
to the class.  Provide feedback on 
their delivery. 
 
Have students tell a 
story about 
something that 
happened to them.  
Use a rubric to 
assess their ability 
to speak clearly, 
audibly and with 
appropriate volume, 
pacing and 
expression.

Pitch refers to how high or how low the 
person is speaking.  Some people 
normally may have high-pitched voices, 
others may have low-pitched voices.  
When completing dramatic activities, the 
speaker may vary the pitch depending on 
who is speaking. 
 
Examples: 
baby- high squeaky voice 
giant – low deep voice 
 
Intonation refers to the rising and falling 
of the voice.  The voice may rise or fall if a 
question is being asked or a demand is 
being made.  The intonation may vary 
depending on the purpose of the 
statement.  A person speaking in a 
monotone does not have the rhythmic rise 
and fall of the voice.  There is only one 
tone being used. 
 
Pause – Sometimes speakers pause to 
conclude a point, for emphasis, to get the 
audience’s attention and to allow the 
audience time to think about what has 
transpired.

Example: Think about when the winner of 
a competitive event is about to be 
announced.  Quite often the speaker 
pauses, leaving the audience in suspense 
before continuing to announce the winner. 
 
Pronunciation – This refers to the 
correctness of sound in a word.  When 
speaking formally, ensure that sounds like 
the following are said correctly: 
 Words beginning with th. 
 Endings of words like ing, ed and s. 
Use tongue, teeth, and lips to produce the 
correct sounds.   
 
Facial expressions and gestures are a 
form of non-verbal communication that 
help to convey the emotions of the 
speaker.  
 
Examples:   
 If happy news is being delivered, the 
speaker might wear a smile. 
 If the listener wanted to show how big 
something was, they may spread their 
arms apart to demonstrate this. 
 
Facial expressions and gestures can help 
to keep the listeners engaged. They 
should not be overused as they can also 
distract.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A syllable is a unit of pronunciation. 
It is a word or part of a word with a 
single vowel sound. The number of 
syllables in a word is determined by 
the number of vowel sounds. Words 
can be divided into syllables.  
  
Syllabication helps in:   
a. Decoding words  
b. Reading fluently   
c. Spelling words accurately   
d. Dividing words at the end of a line 
when writing   
 
Example: In the word graceful, it 
would be “grace-ful” and not “gr-
aceful” or “gracef-ul”  
 
 
 
Basic:  Place students in groups. 
Give students word cards and 
rubber bands. Have students use 
the rubber bands to indicate 
where the word should be divided. 
Have them use this to call the 
words.  Have them match the 
correct syllabication rules to each 
word.   
  
Technology Adaptation:   
Write words on the 
whiteboard using the video 
conferencing tool 
or “whiteboard.fi” and allow 
students to annotate to divide 
words into syllables.  
 
Intermediate:  Divide the class 
into two teams.  Have students

Syllabication Rules:  
  
When a word ends in ‘le’ preceded by 
a consonant, divide the word before 
that consonant. Example: fiz-zle  
 
Sample Words 
 
gargle 
beagle   
steeple 
cuddle   
wrestle 
sizzle   
tentacle 
mantle   
                                           
When a word has a suffix with a vowel 
sound in it, divide the word between 
the base word and the suffix. 
Example: laugh-ing   
  
Sample Words 
 
spotless 
sprinter   
graceful 
breakable   
nonfiction 
disagree 
cooperate 
preaching 
                                           
When a word has a prefix, divide the 
word between the prefix and the base 
word. Example: re-new  
  
Sample Words 
 
postpone 
reinforce   
rebuild   
misbehave 
preview      
reread   
play a game of “Syllabication 
Baseball.” The pitcher gives words 
that each student (batter) divides 
into syllables. To score a home 
run, the batter must correctly 
divide the word and identify which 
syllabication rule or rules apply.  
  
Technology Adaptation:  
Use a gamification platform such 
as ‘Quizizz’, ‘Blooket’, 
and ‘Quizlet’ to formatively assess 
students in an engaging activity.  
   
Advanced:  Have students create 
“increasing sentences.” The first 
word in the sentence should have 
one syllable, the second, two 
syllables, and so on.  
Example: They shouted 
joyfully, “congratulations”! Have 
students divide selected words 
into syllables.

identify whether they have a 
hard ‘c’ or a soft ‘c’ sound. If they 
have both hard ‘c’ words or soft 
‘c’ words, the student can keep the 
cards.  If not, then they should be 
returned face down to the table.  The 
student with the most cards at the end 
wins.    
  
Intermediate:   Using content reading 
material, have students identify words 
with a specific sound (hard ‘c’, soft ‘c’, 
hard ‘g’ or soft ‘g’).  Have them record 
the sentence.  Provide them with an 
opportunity to share their sentences.  
 
Provide students with a 
list of unfamiliar words 
that contain the hard 
and soft ‘c’ and ‘g’ 
words.  Have them use 
the rules to decode 
these words.

A consonant blend refers to two or 
more consonants that are sounded 
together.  Each consonant keeps its own 
sound when blended.  
   
There are four main basic forms of initial, 
medial, and or final consonant blends 
which are: r-blends, s-blends, l-blends, 
and n-blends.  
  
Sample Words:   
 
There are also blends that contain three 
consonants.  Common three consonant 
blends include: str, spl, shr, thr, scr, 
and spr.

consonants that together represent one 
sound.  
 
Consonant digraphs are:  
/ch/ as in scratch  
/sh/ as in shiver  
/zh/ as in treasure  
/th/ as in thermometer (voiceless)  
/th/ as in therapy (voiced)  
/wh/ as in whether; whimper

Basic:  Provide students with a list of 
words.  Have them pronounce the words 
and tell if they hear an initial, middle, or 
final diagraph.  
Example:   march, that, washing.  
  
Intermediate: Divide students into small 
groups.  Have them listen to an audio 
recording of the reading of a word list. 
Ask them to determine the digraphs 
heard in the words. Students should be 
able to replay the list, start and stop it as 
necessary.  Have them use a chart to 
categorize words with the same 
digraphs.  Have them add additional 
words that utilize those same digraphs. 
  
Advanced: Give students a variety of 
sentences containing words with initial, 
middle, and final digraphs.  Have 
students decode words to determine the 
digraphs used.  
 
Example:

When the consonant ‘r’ comes after a 
vowel or vowel, it sometimes changes 
the vowel sound. The letter ‘r’ makes 
the vowel have a sound that is different 
from the usual short or long sound. This 
special sound is considered ‘r-
controlled’.  
  
(Examples: heart /ar/, sports /or/, and 
curb /ur/)  
   
Sample Words

a table containing the “r-controlled” words 
with the /ar/, /ir/ or /or/ sounds. Ask them 
to underline the “r-controlled” vowel 
sounds.  Have them decode the words. 
  
Intermediate: Allow students to 
write a poem of their choice using “r-
controlled” words. Students should 
place emphasis on rhyming 
patterns and figurative language.   
 
 
Advanced:  Students can be an “r-
controlled” detective by searching 
the newspaper, storybooks, and 
magazines for words linked to the spelling 
rule. Students will then make a bar graph 
and indicate how many times r -controlled 
vowels occurred. Have students use ten of 
these words to build sentences.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The /l/ sound at the end of a word 
can be spelt in several different 
ways.  
  
Generally, ‘al’ is used when adding 
a suffix on to a base word.     
Example: period - periodical  
  
Sample words  
carnival          criminal  
electrical        functional  
intestinal        maternal  
principal         tutorial  
  
Use ‘le’ if the sound is part of the 
word.  A consonant 
normally forms a part of this end 
syllable.  The ‘le’ ending is seen 
mainly after the following 
letters:  b, c, d, f, g, k, p, sl, st, t a
nd z.   
 
Sample Words  
ble – capable, possible, valuable   
cle –bicycle, particle, tentacle  
dle – saddle, rekindle, straddle  
fle – truffle, sniffle, unruffle  
gle – gullible, rectangle, struggle 
  
Basic:  Have students 
unscramble spelling words.   
 
Technology Adaptation:   
Use a whiteboard platform or 
the Whiteboard in the video 
conferencing tool to allow 
students to type their responses.  
  
Intermediate:  Allow students to 
create two sets of word cards 
using words with the /l/ sounds. 
Students will then play “Go 
Fish” by describing the word so 
that another classmate can figure 
out if they have that same word. If 
they do, they can use the words in 
a sentence and test each other on 
the spelling of the word.  
 
Advanced:  Divide the class into

provide the meanings.  Students 
will have to figure out the word 
that goes with that meaning 
before spelling the word.  The

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A trigraph is a group of three letters 
that together form a single specific 
sound.  
 
The letter combination ‘dge’ is 
a trigraph because the three letters 
always function together to form the 
same sound as the letter “j”. 
Examples: widget, grudge, fidget   
  
When the /j/ sound is heard at the end 
of a syllable and it is immediately 
preceded by a short vowel, it is 
usually spelt ‘dge’.  
Example: porridge  
  
If there is a vowel and consonant 
team before the /j/ sound, it is spelt 
‘ge’. Example: ‘forge’ 
  
Sample List:  
smudge          cadge   
ecolodge        cartridge  
straightedge   wedge   
fridge              grudge    
nudge             Cambridge  
revenge          splurge   
hinge   
 
Basic:  Have students create a set 
of picture word cards that represent 
words spelt with the ‘dge’ or ‘ge’ 
combination of letters. Pair them up to 
present their pictures to a partner.     
The partner will then have to identify 
the word using the picture and spell it.  
Example: Students take/draw a 
picture of a ‘smudge’ to be presented 
to a partner.   
 
Intermediate: Write a list of unfamiliar 
words in white font/colouring pencil. 
Have students change the 
background colour in each box or 
colour over the words with different

groups (two-six) depending on size 
and space of classroom. Dictate an 
unfamiliar word with and or without the 
‘dge’ spelling (knowledge, etc.). 
Each team member must race to the 
board or annotate on whiteboard (via

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Diphthongs are types of vowels 
where two vowel sounds are 
connected in a continuous, gliding 
motion (to make one sound). They are 
often referred to as gliding vowels.  
  
Examples of diphthongs are:  /oi/, 
/oy/, /ow/, /ou/  
  
The diphthongs ‘ou’ and ‘ow’ can have 
two distinct sounds.   
 
 /ou/ can sound like ‘ou’ as in 
‘ground’ and like ‘ou’ as in ‘soup’. 
 /ow/ can sound like ‘ow’ as in 
‘coward’, and ‘ow’ as in ‘glow’.  
  
Sample Words:  
needlepoint              steroid  
counsellor                accountant  
showered                 marrow    
employer                  voyage  
turquoise                  fountain   
  
If two vowels are beside each other in 
a word or syllable, the first vowel is 
usually long while the second vowel 
remains silent. This is called a vowel 
digraph.  
Basic: Have students identify the 
diphthongs and vowel digraphs by 
viewing words on flash cards that 
contain them. Allow students to circle 
the diphthongs and underline the 
vowel digraphs in each word.  
  
Intermediate:  Students can 
unscramble words with diphthongs and 
match each with its correct meaning.  
  
Advanced:  Have students write a 
cinquain using as many words as 
possible with diphthongs and 
digraphs. 
  
 
Have students read 
words in context that 
have the diphthongs 
and vowel digraphs.

Alphabetical order refers to the 
organizing of a list of words in the order 
of the alphabet based on the letters in 
their names. This makes information 
easier to find in a dictionary, thesaurus, 
phone book, index, etc.  
  
There are specific rules as to the way in 
which words are organized in 
alphabetical order.  
  
Arrange words in order using their 
first letters.  If the first letters are the 
same, then use the second letters to 
determine the order in which the words 
should appear.  If those are the same, 
then move to the fourth and fifth letters.  
  
Example: detergent, determine, 
deterrent  
  
The names of people should be 
alphabetized based on their last 
names.  The first and last names 
should be separated by a comma.

A dictionary contains a list of words 
arranged alphabetically.  The meaning 
for each word is explained and other 
important information is provided.    
  
Guide words - These words are at 
the top of the page in a dictionary or 
thesaurus. They are the first and last 
words found on that page.  
  
Etymology (origin of word) often 
appears in brackets at the end of the 
definition.  
  
Entry Word- This shows how the 
word is spelt. The entry word has dots 
to divide the word into syllables.  
   
Pronunciation- Pronunciations are 
found in a bracket immediately after 
the spelling of the word. This tells how 
to say the word. It is given in symbols 
that stand for certain sounds.  
   
Part of Speech- This tells how a word 
may be used in a sentence.  
   
Meaning- The different meanings of 
the word are numbered.  
Basic:  Place a spelling word 
on several index cards, then  
place cards face down. Choose 
a card and have students compete 
to be the first to find the word in the 
dictionary. Have them look for the 
target information.

Contractions can be made by 
shortening a word or a pair of words 
by omitting certain letters or sounds.  
An apostrophe is used to indicate 
missing letters or words. Contractions 
can be used when writing informally.  
Words should be written fully when 
writing formally.   
  
Pronoun and Verb Contractions:  
 
I’d - I would  
he'd – he would  
she'd – she would  
we'd – we would  
they'd – they would  
you'd – you would  
  
Verbs and Adverbs Contractions  
  
mightn't – might not  
mustn't – must not  
shouldn't – should not  
shan't – shall not  
oughtn't – ought not  
that'd – that would  
where'd – where did  
should’ve- should have   
  
Basic:  In small groups have 
students play Contraction 
Concentration where they have to 
match words with their contracted 
forms  
  
Intermediate: Give 
students groups of words to change 
into contractions. In addition to 
writing the contraction, the students 
should indicate which letter(s) 
has/have been omitted.  
  
Advanced: Have students listen to 
radio commercials and then write 
the contractions heard.

An abbreviation is a shortened form 
of a word that ends with a period.   
  
In abbreviations you will notice that:   
  
1. Most are spelt with the first    
    letters of the word.   
     Example:  advertisement – ad. 
 
2. Some are spelt with a  
    combination of letters from the  
    word.   
    Example:  international – intl. 
  
3. Others are spelt with  
    letters not found in the original  
    word.  
     Example:  pound – lb 
 
4. Many abbreviations begin with a  
    capital letter.  
      Example:  Doctor – Dr. 
 
5. Add a period to an abbreviation  
    when it does not include the last  
    letter of the whole word.  
    Example:  negative – neg. 
 
 
Basic: Provide students with a list 
of words.  Have them provide the 
abbreviations for words on the list. 
   
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with different ways in which 
abbreviations are formed.  Have 
them use newspapers and

Objective 2.29 Identify the base word, prefix or suffix in words and the meanings associated with them. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Words often contain base words. A 
base word is the part of a word that can 
stand alone and has meaning.  It is 
the simplest form of the word.  
  
Example: ‘Write’ is a base word that 
means ‘compose’.  
   
Prefixes and Suffixes can be added to 
base words to change the meanings of 
these words.  
  
Prefix – A prefix is a word or syllable 
that is added at the beginning of a base 
word. Prefixes have their own special 
meanings too.  
  
Example: 
The prefix ‘re’ means ‘again’. The 
word ‘rewrite’ means to ‘write again’.  
  
Sometimes prefixes have similar 
meanings, like ‘im’ and ‘non’.  They 
both mean ‘not’.  
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Distribute several cards with 
root/base words, prefixes, and 
suffixes. Students will manipulate the 
word cards to form as many words 
as possible.   
 
 Examples:  cycle, un, re, ful, 
wrap, help, like  
 
 Possible Words: recycle, 
unwrap, helpful  
   
Intermediate: Have students match 
prefixes/suffixes and their 
meanings.  
   
Advanced:  Have students play 
“Word Builders” game. Each student 
will be given a sheet of paper divided 
into three column headings –
Prefix, Base Word, and Suffix. Each 
student will write ten base words in 
the appropriate column. They will 
then exchange papers with a partner 
who would add a prefix and a suffix 
to each base word to form a new 
word. Students will have to provide 
the meaning of the new word 
formed. 
Have students read 
a paragraph.  Ask 
them to identify base 
words that contain 
prefixes or suffixes.  
Have them write the 
meaning of the base 
word and its new 
meaning based on 
the prefix or suffix 
that was added.

A suffix is a letter or group of letters 
added after a base word to alter its 
meaning and form a new word.  
  
Example: ‘Mother’ is a base word 
meaning ‘a person who has given 
birth’.  
  
‘Hood’ is a suffix meaning ‘condition, 
state of’.   
 
mother + hood = motherhood

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
An inflectional ending is a word part 
that is added to a base word.  This 
ending can make a word plural, 
change word tense or help to make 
comparisons.  Some inflectional 
endings are:   s, es, ing, ed, er and 
est. 
 
1.  Adding ‘e’ and ‘est’   
 If the word ends in a ‘consonant’ and 
‘y’, change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’. Example: crazy - craziest  
 
If the word ends in a ‘consonant’ and 
‘e’, remove the ‘e’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’. Example:  wide - widest 
 
If the word ends in a consonant vowel 
consonant, double the last letter, and 
add ‘er’ or ‘est’.  
Example: fat – fatter/fattest 
 
Sample Words: 
 
closest 
cuter 
fanciest 
ghastliest 
prettiest 
 
whiter 
strangest 
 
 
 
Basic: Create a worksheet for 
students to complete where 
they have to follow the rules 
to add inflectional endings.   
  
Intermediate: Using a 
newspaper, or magazine, 
have students work in groups 
to list at least 50 inflectional 
words, as they appear in 
articles.  
   
Advanced:  Have students 
create a pop-up book which 
explains the use of inflectional 
endings. They must use a lot 
of examples with pictures.  
 
Have students complete 
a quiz where they have 
to add inflectional 
endings to words.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The two main spellings used in The 
Bahamas are a mixture of British 
English and American English. It is 
important to distinguish between the 
two because of the spelling and 
pronunciation differences.  
  
British English keeps the original 
spelling of words that is used from 
other languages, mainly French and 
German.  
  
American English spellings are 
usually based on how the word 
sounds when it is spoken.  
  
When writing, do not switch between 
the British and American spelling. Be 
consistent with the spelling selected 
throughout.  
 
Some spelling differences can be 
found at the end of words or the 
spelling changes completely.   
The endings of words may differ 
depending on whether the British or 
American Spelling is used. 
 
 
Basic:  Allow students to 
complete a worksheet 
distinguishing between British and 
American words (see Resources).  
 
Intermediate: Give students five 
to ten words to decode, using a 
cipher key. Have them write the 
word on a sheet, then state 
whether it follows American or 
British spelling.  
 
Example: 
A= 7  
B= 10  
C = 26  
 
Advanced: Engage students in a 
quiz using a gamification

Not all the words spoken in English are 
English words.  Their roots were formed 
in another language. Being able to 
recognize certain roots can assist with 
spelling and in understanding what 
particular words mean.  It can also help 
to see connections between words.  
  
Japanese  
Japanese is one of the newer 
languages to have some of its words 
adopted into the English 
language.  Symbols are used to 
represent words in this language.  
  
The long /e/ is often spelt with an i at 
the end of words.  
 emoji  
 hibachi  
 origami  
 sushi  
 tsunami  
  
In some words, however, the /e/ is 
spelt e.  
 karate  
 karaoke  
  
Basic:  Play audio clips of the 
language so that students can hear 
how certain words are 
pronounced.   Have students use 
this information to practise saying 
their spelling words correctly.  
  
Intermediate: Have students use 
their smart phones to take pictures 
of other words that have originated 
from the target language.  Have 
students give each other mock 
spelling tests on these words.

Quotation Marks – Voice may need 
to be changed to indicate that a 
person is speaking, to reflect what is 
happening in the passage, and to 
reflect who is speaking.  
 
Example: a big burly criminal may 
have a rough voice while a woman 
might have a soft voice.  
  
Ellipses – Voice drops or trails off.  It 
could be that the person is unsure 
what to do or has several thoughts

It is important, when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at which 
you are reading, the rise and fall of 
your voice and expression.  
  
Rate – Refers to how fast or how 
slowly one speaks.  Be careful not to 
speak so slowly that listeners lose 
interest. Do not read too quickly, 
otherwise the words may not be clear 
and the listeners may find it difficult to 
follow.  
  
The control of breathing when reading 
can be used to influence rate or pace. 
If someone is running or crying, use 
quick short breaths between the 
words.  If someone is relaxed, this 
may be portrayed by breathing out 
slowly.     
  
Intonation – This refers to the rise 
and fall of the voice to reflect what is 
happening in the reading piece.  
  
 
Vocal Expression – The tone of the 
reader should reflect the mood of the 
piece.   
Basic:  Have students practise 
reading texts at different rates to 
portray excitement, fear, and 
sadness.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students listen 
to a Bahamian storyteller sharing a 
local tale.  Ask them to discuss the 
effective use of voice and breathing.

Text structure refers to how an author 
organizes information in a text. Being 
aware of non-fiction text structures and 
their purpose, helps readers to navigate 
the text that they are reading.  There are 
five basic structures that authors use. 
 
Description - Provides a variety of 
information about something that is alive, 
such as a person, animal or plant; 
something that is not alive like an object 
(weather wind vane); an event such as 
when The Bahamas gained Independence 
on 10th July, 1973; a process (liquid 
changing to gas) or a place (the 
Hermitage on the island of Cat Island).        
 Examples:  brochures, menus.               
 Keywords/phrases: for example, the 
characteristics of    
 
Sequence - Provides the order in which 
something happened or should happen.   
 Examples:  agenda, directions to 
locate something or some place  
 Key Words: first, next, finally 
Basic: Create a text structure, 
student-made anchor chart that 
outlines the definitions, 
examples, key words and 
graphic organizers that are used 
for that specific component. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
read various short passages.  
Ask them to highlight key words 
and identify text structures. 
 
Advanced: Have students read 
two passages on the same topic 
with different text structures.  
Then have them discuss and 
evaluate which text structure 
used was more effective.

different samples of 
non-fiction text.  Have 
them identify the text 
structure used in each 
and give reasons for 
their choice.

Objective 2.38 Identify elements of a story (characters, setting, themes, point of view, and plot). 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A well-written narrative has five core 
elements. Being able to identify these 
elements and knowing how they work 
together in a story, helps a reader to 
better understand and appreciate the 
text. 
 
The five core elements of a 
narrative are: 
 
Character: the people or animals and 
objects behaving like humans in the 
story. To learn more about the nature 
of a character, a good reader pays 
attention to his/her words, thoughts, 
actions, and appearance. A person’s 
nature is his/her usual attitude or 
behaviour. In most stories, the nature 
of a character remains the same 
throughout the story or changes after 
a dramatic event. 
To figure out the nature of a character, 
ask yourself: 
 What thoughts is the character 
having? 
 What is the character saying? 
 How is the character acting? 
Basic: Bigger than Life Choose a 
story familiar to the students and 
select a character. Using the Think-
Aloud Strategy, draw a large life-
size sketch of this character based 
on any descriptions given in the 
story. Quote phrases directly from 
the book and place evidence of the 
character’s [1] thoughts and words 
on the head and [2] actions on the 
feet and hands. Use the “Interpreting 
the Nature of Character” guiding 
questions to infer about and place [3] 
their personality on the heart. 
 
Working in Pairs:  In groups of two, 
assign familiar characters to each 
student group. Allow them to follow 
the same procedure as above to 
create a life-size sketch of this 
character. Carve out time for 
students to present their models. 
Extend this activity to incorporate 
teachings on the character’s point of 
view and conflict.

yourself: 
 Does the narrator have any strong

way the story is told? 
 
Setting: the location and time of a 
story. It can be about a place that is 
real or fictional and about a time that 
is in the past, present or future. If 
the author does not identify the 
setting, a good reader looks for details 
to figure it out such as the weather, 
time of day, buildings, and seasons. 
The setting can put the audience in a 
certain mood while reading the text. 
However, not every setting is 
important to the story. 
 
To determine if the setting is important 
a reader should ask:

Plot: the order of the most important 
events in a story. The four (4) main 
parts of a plot are: the background 
(introducing the setting and 
characters), a conflict, the climax, 
and a resolution (how the problem is 
solved). 
The conflict of a story is something 
that goes wrong for the main 
character. The main character can 
face a conflict with [1] himself, [2] 
another character, [3] culture or [4] 
nature. In most cases, the character 
then takes action to solve this 
problem. Good readers know that 
there may be more than one major 
conflict in a story. 
The climax is the most exciting part of 
the story. In most stories, this 
happens right before the problem is 
solved. Being able to follow a clear 
plot helps a reader to better 
understand, enjoy and evaluate the 
author’s work. 
 
Theme: The hidden message or 
lesson that the author wants the 
reader to learn from a story. It is

usually a lesson to better the reader’s 
life and their relationships with others. 
Some common themes are 
perseverance, courage, tolerance 
and change. These themes are 
known as universal themes. 
 
To figure out the theme of the story, 
ask yourself: 
 Did the main character change 
after solving the problem? 
 What lesson did this experience 
teach the main character about 
being a better person? 
 Can this lesson also help me 
become a better person or have a 
better relationship with others?

Objective 2.39 Use context clues to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Context Clues are the words that 
surround an unfamiliar word.  These 
words give clues about the meaning of 
the new word.  Some context clues are: 
  
Synonyms – Words that mean the 
same or almost the same as an 
unfamiliar word.  
 
Example:   
The oldest lighthouse in The Bahamas 
is situated or located Paradise Island.  
 
Antonyms – Sometimes a context clue 
would contrast with new word.  
 
Example:   
Unfortunately, it was not the drizzling 
type of rain, but the drenching kind as 
Audra emerged from the hairdresser’s 
shop.   
 
Definition – This is the kind of context 
clue where the writer gives the meaning 
of or explains a word in a sentence.  
 
 
Basic: Provide each group of students 
with a paragraph (large print) that 
contains a few words. Have 
“synonyms” for these words available.  
Provide students with glue and have 
them paste the words in the correct 
positions on the chart.  Have students 
then read the paragraph with the 
replaced words.  Ask them to explain 
what helped them to make their 
choices. 
  
Intermediate:  Prepare dominoes 
(index cards) with a sentence on one 
end and a word on the opposite end.  
Students will follow the rules of 
dominos and match unfamiliar words 
with their synonyms. This could be 
done as a group or class activity.  
 
Example- “The tall, slender girl was 
selected for the basketball team.” Will

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The main idea of a text is the 
most important idea that the 
writer wants you to know about 
the topic. It is what is mostly 
being talked about in the text. 
Knowing the main idea helps a 
reader to better understand and 
organize the lesser details of the 
text when summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and retelling.   
 
Sometimes, a writer directly states 
the main idea in the text. It can be 
stated at the beginning of a 
paragraph as the topic sentence 
or the end as the concluding 
sentence. However, the main 
idea can also appear anywhere in 
the text.   
 
Sometimes, the main idea is 
unstated and the reader must 
figure it out from the supporting 
details. The supporting details 
are the sentences that tell us 
more information about the main 
idea. There are five main types 
of supporting details:  
[1] examples, [2] facts and figures, 
Basic: What is The Big Idea? Give each 
student a card with a list of words and phrases 
that supports an unknown topic. One at a 
time, read aloud a topic and challenge 
students to decide if it is the matching main 
idea for their details. Pause to allow students 
to self-correct or challenge the matches of 
others. Lead from the activity to discuss main 
ideas and supporting details.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Sequence is the order in which things 
happen.  Sequence also refers to steps 
in a process such as a recipe or 
directions.  
  
Authors may use key words or phrases 
to help readers understand sequence.    
  
Key/Signal Words:  after, before, 
while, then, next, first, last, later 
meanwhile, during, 
finally, Wednesday, and in the 
morning     
  
Dates tell you a specific month or year.  
 
Key words such as ‘meanwhile’ and 
‘during’ are clues that two or more 
events are happening at the same time. 
If there are no clue words, picture the 
events from the story in your 
mind and ask yourself, “What happened 
first, next, then and last?”  
   
In writing, bullets, numbers, and 
numerals can be used to indicate 
sequence.  
 
Basic:   Have students read and 
follow directions for a science 
experiment.  Ask students to recall the 
steps orally, using sequence key 
words/phrases. Assign sequence 
related questions based on the 
experiment.   
  
Intermediate:  Have students read a

copies of an obituary or a biography of 
a Bahamian icon.  An example

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Most stories are divided into two major 
genres: fiction and non-fiction. The 
Latin word genre means ‘group’ or 
‘kind’. 
 
Knowing whether a story is fictional or 
realistic can help the reader to better 
understand the ideas of the author and 
make reasonable predictions. Good 
readers slow down when reading 
nonfiction to think about what is being 
communicated. 
 
The fiction genre has stories that are 
created from the authors’ imaginations. 
It refers to things that are invented or 
not true. Examples of fictional stories 
include: fairy tales, legends, 
historical fiction, science fiction, 
folklore, mythology and realistic 
fiction. 
 
Fairy Tale - stories about magical 
creatures with happy endings, usually 
written for children. 
 
Fable - stories where animals, plants or 
objects are behaving like humans. The 
purpose is to teach a life lesson known 
Basic:  On the Move! Divide a

designed to identify 
genres and sub-genres 
based on descriptions. Let 
students document their 
scores in their notebooks.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The author does not always directly tell 
the reader everything that is happening 
in the story.  However, the writer gives 
hints or clues so that the reader is able to 
figure out what is not stated directly.  
Good readers use the information given, 
along with what they already know, to 
make inferences. 
 
There are several different types of 
inferences that can be made. 
 
1. Object – Authors may give clues as 
to what an object might be.   
 
To figure out clues about the object, 
ask the following questions.   
1. For what purpose is the object 
being used?   
2. What sensory details are being 
provided?   
3. Where is the object located? 
 
Example:  Its diamond shape 
moved easily in the wind.  We tied 
bows on its tail so that it would 
dance gracefully for us. What is the 
object?  It is a kite.  
 
Basic: Have students review 
several store receipts with 
purchased items and make 
inferences about what the person is 
going to make. 
   
Example:  
 Flour 
 Yeast 
 Lard 
 
Using the store receipt, have 
students infer what the person is 
about to make. 
  
Intermediate: Have students  
write riddles where inferences 
must be made in order to solve 
them.  The riddles should be 
related to objects, categories and 
instruments.  Have students share 
riddles and discuss word clues.

A cause is an action or idea that 
makes something happen.  An effect 
is what happens because of this 
action or idea.  
   
A cause can have more than one 
effect as well as an effect can have 
more than one cause.  To find 
the cause-and-effect relationship 
during reading, a good reader asks:  
 
 
What happened? (Effect)  
 
Why did this happen? (Cause)  
   
Sometimes, an author or speaker may 
use a signal word to show a cause-
and-effect relationship.  
   
Key/Signal Words:  
because, since, when, as a result, 
therefore and so

A generalization is a broad statement 
that tells about a group of people, 
animals or things and what they have 
in common.  
  
Example:  All Bahamians love 
Junkanoo.  
   
 
Generalizations can be valid or

generalizations are not supported by 
facts.    
  
Clue words that often signal valid 
generalizations are: some, most, 
sometimes, often, probably, few, 
many, rarely  
  
Clue words that often signal faulty 
generalizations are: everyone, 
nobody, all, none, always, never.  
Some generalizations do not have 
signal words.  
 
Example:  Regatta is a traditional 
event that Bahamians enjoy.  
 
Basic: Spot the Generalization  
Provide students with groups of 
sentences.  One sentence in each group

Resources 
Every author has a reason for writing.  
This is known as the author’s purpose. 
There are four common reasons for  
writing:  
 
To Inform - When writing to inform or 
explain, the author uses facts. This is 
known as expository writing. 
Examples: cookbooks, science, history 
textbooks, and biographies  
 
To Entertain - Many stories, plays, and 
poems are written to teach a lesson or 
simply amuse its audience. This is also 
known as narrative writing.  
 
To Describe - An author may describe an 
event, scene, or person in detail. Words 
that appeal to the senses of the reader or 
listener are used. This is known 
as descriptive writing.  
 
To Persuade -Sometimes an author tries 
to persuade readers to agree with him or 
her or to take a particular action. This is 
known as persuasive writing. Examples: 
most commercials, campaign speeches, 
and advertisements.  
  
Basic:  Newspaper Search  
Have students look through 
newspapers and work in groups to 
find articles that match each 
author’s purpose.

Authors sometimes use propaganda 
techniques to influence the opinions, 
emotions, attitudes, or behaviours of 
readers.  There are several main 
propaganda techniques.   
 
 Bandwagon – Gives the impression 
that everyone is doing a particular 
thing and that is why readers should do 
it as well, so that they are not left out. 
Example: “Everyone will be paying a 
dollar for ‘Dress up Day’.  You will be 
the only one in uniform.” 
 
 Glittering Generalizations – Are 
statements that make people feel 
good.  They can be based loosely on 
people’s beliefs and morals.  They are 
positive in nature.   
Examples: 
1. “You are worth it!” 
2. “You deserve a break.” 
3. “Eat fresh…pick from our organic 
veggies.”  
 
 Name Calling – This is used to show a 
person or a product in a bad light.  
Example:   One brand of ketchup 
might be called “thin” and “watery” 
while another may be called “thick” and 
“flavourful”.

 Testimonial – Celebrities, social 
media personalities, public figures and 
movie starts may be used to endorse a 
product or a belief.   
Example: “Basketball player, Tim 
Smith, eats Wheaties to keep him 
making those jump shots.” 
 
 Transfer – This is the transfer of a 
good quality or a bad quality on to 
something else by association. 
Example:  Shaunae Miller-Uibo and 
Aliv.  Because Shaunae Miller-Uibo is 
fast on the track, Aliv’s internet is also 
fast. 
 
Regardless of the author’s purpose, there 
are clue words in his or her writing that tell 
us how the author feels or his/her 
viewpoint about what has been written.  
 
To find out how the author feels about a 
piece of writing, ask the following 
questions. 
1. Are there “feeling” words included in 
the piece, such as good, bad, great, 
fantastic, terrible etc.? 
2. How is the event, person, thing, or idea 
being described? irresponsible, 
organized, interesting, boring etc. 
3. Are negative or positive words being

used in the piece?  distasteful, tasty, 
satisfying, dissatisfied, filling etc. 
4. Does the author appear to be arguing 
for one side over another? 
 
Examples: 
 
Informative Piece – Crabbing is so much 
fun!  Before going, you need to make sure 
that you have all your tools such as a 
searchlight, a bag to put the crabs in, a 
stick and perhaps a pair of gloves. Once 
you have these materials, you are all set.  
Let the adventure begin! 
 
 How does the author feel about 
crabbing?  
 
 Are there clue words that tell us how 
the author feels? The word “fun” is 
used to indicate that crabbing can be 
an enjoyable experience.  The author 
also looks at it as an adventure. 
 
Descriptive Piece- The ground was 
soggy and wet!  What was once soil was 
now gathered into little mounds of mud.

 How does the author feel about 
what he is writing?  Does the author 
use descriptive words to describe 
the playing field and their uniforms?  
The author describes the field as being 
“soggy”, “wet” and “muddy”.  He also 
refers to “irritating squishing sounds”. 
The uniforms were “soaked” and 
covered in “brown spots”. They were 
stomping through the mud which 
indicates anger.  He indicates that the 
game they had been waiting to play is 
now ruined.   The author is probably 
feeling disappointed and a little angry 
about the rain.    
 
Expository Piece – Visiting the island of 
Inagua is one of the best decisions you 
can make.  It has the lovely flamingos, 
the curious, wild donkeys, and the 
magnificent salt ponds.  There is also a 
special place by the pumps where fish 
can be found in abundance. 
   
 Are the descriptive words negative or 
positive?  Do they give us clues as to 
how the author is feeling? The author 
uses words such as “best”, “lovely”, 
“magnificent”, “special” and

“abundance“…very positive words.  
We can conclude that the author loves 
Inagua. 
 
Persuasive Piece- One of the best things 
you can do in this life is to take care of 
your teeth.  Brush and floss after every 
meal and you will not be sorry. This will 
help you to avoid getting harmful 
cavities and discoloured teeth.  You 
would never have to get needles in your 
gums to numb the pain while the dentist 
fills the cavities.  Work hard to keep them 
milky white and strong!  You won’t be 
sorry. 
 
 What are the clue words that tell us 
how the author feels about taking care 
of our teeth?  “best”, “you won’t be 
sorry”, “avoid getting harmful cavities 
and discoloured teeth”. The author also 
encourages readers to “work hard…” 
and indicates that “You won’t be sorry”.

Making judgements is more than just 
forming an opinion about characters, 
things, events, and ideas in a story or 
article that may have no 
consequence. Judgements are 
decisions that are made based on 
evidence found in the passage, what 
the readers know and the reader’s 
own experiences, beliefs, morals, and 
values. 
   
When reading fiction, readers make 
judgements about the decisions and 
actions of characters in a story. They 
may agree or disagree with a 
character’s actions.  They may also 
decide if a character or an action is 
fair or unfair, wise or foolish, or 
generous or selfish.    
   
When reading nonfiction, readers 
make judgements about the author 
and the ideas, facts and 
opinions presented.   
 
To do this, readers should consider 
the following:

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Good readers recognize when an author 
is using figurative language. A figure of 
speech is a phrase or words that mean 
“something different altogether from what 
is being said”. Knowing how each figure 
of speech works can help a reader see a 
clearer picture of what is being 
described.   
   
Personification gives human qualities to 
non-human things.  Example: The 
computer screen winked at the man 
who pressed its reset button.  
   
When trying to find and interpret 
personification, a reader can ask:  
 Which object is performing the 
action?  
 What human action is the thing doing 
that cannot really happen?  
 What is the author trying to tell me 
about this thing being described?  
  
Hyperbole: This is an exaggeration. It is 
over-emphasizing or stretching the truth 
to make a point to the readers, to be 
dramatic or to add humour. Example:  
Shall I say this for the millionth time?  
Basic: On the Move! Place cards 
that identify the different types of 
figurative language by question 
type or a descriptive sentence in a 
bag. Have students randomly 
choose a card. Assign labelled 
spots around the classroom for 
each figure of speech. Allow 
students to classify their 
descriptions by moving under the 
correct figure of speech. Have 
students take turns reading their 
descriptions aloud and defending 
their choice. Provide corrective 
feedback, as required.  
  
Intermediate: Character Sketch 
Play the movie clip of the song, 
“You’re a Mean One, Mr.

When trying to find and interpret a 
hyperbole, a reader can ask:  
 Is this statement literally true?  
 Which part of the statement is being 
exaggerated?  
 Is the author trying to emphasize a 
point or just add humour?   
Alliterations and Onomatopoeia act as 
the sound effects of the text.   
   
Alliterations are created by repeating 
the beginning sound in two or more 
neighbouring words. Example: “The 
clowns can count on me to carefully 
count their funds”, smirked Shantell.   
   
Onomatopoeia refers to words that are 
actual sounds. Example: “Snip, snip, 
snippy, snip”, the scissors teased the 
model as it cut her hair.  
   
When trying to interpret an alliteration 
and onomatopoeia, a reader can ask:  
1. What person, place, thing, or idea is 
being described?  
2. What is the sound effect telling me 
about this ____________?   
3. What does the author want me to

observed.  There is a left red margin 
and a right red margin.  
  
Unless you are writing a paragraph, 
begin the line of writing at the left 
margin and end it at the right margin.  
Use syllabication rules to break up a 
word that may be too long to include 
without going over the right margin.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A run-on sentence is two or more 
simple sentences not separated by 
correct punctuation and connecting 
words or conjunctions.  A run-on 
sentence does not mean a sentence 
is too long; longer sentences are likely 
to be run-ons only when they contain 
more than one complete idea. 
 
Example of a Run-On Sentence and 
Ways to Correct it: 
 
“Chocolate is a wonderful treat too 
much can cause a sugar rush!” 
 
1. Chocolate is a wonderful treat.    
    Too much can cause a sugar  
     rush! 
 
2. Chocolate is a wonderful treat, but 
    too much can cause a sugar rush! 
 
3. Chocolate is a wonderful treat; too  
    much can cause a sugar rush! 
 
Basic:  Give each group of students a 
set of sentence strips containing run-on 
and properly written sentences. Have 
students read each sentence.  Ask them 
to separate the sentences into two 
groups: “Run-on Sentences” and 
“Correctly Written Sentences”.   
 
Intermediate:  Give small groups of 
students an extremely lengthy run-on 
sentence on a long construction paper.  
Have them read their sentence aloud in 
one breath, then have them read it where 
they think punctuations should be 
inserted.  Next, allow students to use 
scissors to cut the sentence apart and 
edit for correctness.  Remind students to 
add capital letters and punctuation marks 
to show where one sentence ends and 
the new one begins.   
 
Advanced: Have students edit and 
rewrite a paragraph containing run-on 
sentences.   
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet where 
they have to identify 
and correct run-on 
sentences.

Resources 
Nouns are words that name a person, 
place, animal, thing, or idea. They are 
known as common nouns, when they 
do not name a particular person, place, 
animal, thing, or idea.  
 
Common nouns are capitalized when 
they begin a sentence or are part of a 
title. 
 
Example:   
Person:   police 
Place:      downtown 
Animal:   dog          
Thing:     building 
Idea:        fear 
 
A Proper Noun is the name of a 
particular person, place, or thing.  A 
proper noun begins with a capital letter. 
Days of the week, months of the year 
and holidays are proper nouns. 
 
Example: 
Person:  Stephanie Jones 
Place:     Exuma 
Animal:   Potcake 
Thing:     Ivy L. Dumont Building  
Idea:       Christmas 
Basic:  Have students work in groups 
to find examples of the different types 
of nouns (common, proper) in the 
local newspaper. Have students cut 
them out and tape them under the 
correct heading on a large piece of 
construction paper that is divided into 
sections.   
 
Intermediate:  Arrange students into 
groups. Provide each group with chart 
paper divided into columns and rows.  
Instruct the students to label the 
columns using the words ‘Animals’, 
‘People’, ‘Places’, ‘Ideas’ and ‘Things’.  
Choose a letter and tell the students 
that they have thirty seconds to find a 
noun for each category that begin with 
a specific letter.  Complete several 
rounds using a different letter each 
time. 
 
Advanced:  Have students use a list 
of common and proper nouns to write 
original sentences that include both 
types.  Have them underline the 
nouns and indicate, using ‘C’ or ‘P’ 
whether they are common or proper.   
 
Have students 
complete a worksheet 
where they have to 
identify common and 
proper nouns.   
 
Have them edit their

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A compound word is made up of two 
or more words. 
shoe + lace = shoelace 
class + room = classroom 
mail + box = mailbox 
 
Compound words can come in various 
forms: 
 
Open form – This means that there is a 
space between the two words. 
Example:  seat belt 
 
Closed form – There is no space 
between the words. 
Example:  grandmother 
 
Hyphenated Form - Some compounds 
have a hyphen between the words. This 
helps to show that the words being 
together have their own special 
meaning. 
Example:  up-to-date - current 
 
When using ‘high’ or ‘low’ before a 
noun, use a hyphen. 
Example:   
A low-grade oil can clog your engine.

Collective nouns name groups of 
objects, people or animals. Some 
collective nouns are flexible and can 
be used to name different groups of

keys is called a “bunch”. A group of 
bananas on a tree is called a “bunch”. 
 
However, some collective nouns are 
specific to naming one kind of thing. 
For example, the term "fleet" always 
describes a group of vehicles such as 
a ‘fleet of ships’ and a ‘fleet of cars’.

Resources 
The possessive form of a noun is used to 
show ownership or to describe an attribute.   
 
A singular possessive noun is used to 
show ownership by one person or thing.  
The possessive of a singular noun is 
formed by adding an apostrophe (’) and 
the letter /s/ at the end of the word. 
 
Example:  the pirate’s hat 
 
A plural possessive noun is used to show 
ownership by more than one person or 
thing.  There are two rules for forming a 
plural possessive noun.   
 
1. If the plural noun ends with the  
    letter /s/, add an apostrophe (’) 
   after the /s/.   
   
Example:  The ladies’ suitcases 
 
2. If the plural noun does not end   
    with the letter /s/, add an  
    apostrophe (’) and the letter /s/   
    at the end of the word. 
    
Example:  geese's eggs 
 
Basic:  Have students make 
phrases written on the board show 
possession by adding an 
apostrophe or an apostrophe and 
an /s/.

A verb is a word that tells what the 
subject of a sentence does, did or will 
do.  A verb can also express the state 
of being.   
 
An action verb is a word that 
expresses action.  
 
Example:  Mr. Burrows skippered the 
‘Whitty K’ during the recent Exuma 
Regatta. 
 
Linking verbs do not express action. 
Instead, they connect the subject of the 
verb to additional information about the 
subject. 
 
Example:  The beach is a peaceful 
place. 
 
The following verbs are true linking 
verbs: These include: am, is, are, was, 
were, seem, become. 
 
The following can be both linking or 
action verbs:  feel, look, grow, appear,

Resources 
The tense of a verb shows the time 
of an action. There are three main 
tenses: past, present, and future. 
 
The present tense of a verb means 
that the action is taking place now or 
happens regularly. A verb written in 
the present tense needs to agree with 
the subject of the sentence.  
 
Examples:   
The children attend virtual classes. 
The Bible tells us about God’s grace.  
 
The past tense of a verb means that 
the action has happened already. 
Most past tense verbs end with an 
‘ed’.  
 
Example:  My sister answered the 
phone yesterday. 
 
The future tense of a verb means 
that the action has not happened yet, 
but it will happen. This tense is formed 
by using ‘will’ or ‘shall’ with the 
simple form of the verb.  
 
Example:  Next year, Jeff will enter

Resources 
Good writing starts with well-written 
sentences. A sentence has two parts: 
the complete subject and 
the complete predicate.  
  
The complete subject of a sentence 
includes the main noun or 
pronoun and the additional words 
that tell who or what the sentence is 
about. The subject is usually found 
at the beginning of the sentence.  
 
Example:  Pirates such as Edward 
Teach stole ships.  
 
He was known as one of the most 
feared pirates. 
 
However, the subject of an imperative 
sentence is often not written in the 
sentence. It is understood that the 
subject is ‘you’. 
 
Example:  Go and wipe that messy 
mirror. 
(You) Go and wipe that messy mirror.

complete predicate. Ask students to read 
the newly formed sentences aloud. Start 
this activity with declarative sentences only 
and repeat the exercise gradually adding 
the other types of sentences.  
 
Intermediate: Have students either 
compose or copy from a text an example 
of each of the four types of sentences. 
Then, have them trade their sentences 
with classmates. Students will dissect their 
given sentences into two parts: the 
complete subject and the complete

their noun. 
 
Taking turns, challenge each partner to 
elaborate on the topic by adding one word 
to the subject or the predicate. Encourage 
students to add as many details as 
possible to build the complete subject and 
complete predicate without adding another 
sentence. Model the process of expanding 
the sentence for students, if necessary.

An adjective describes a noun or a 
pronoun. They can tell what kind, how 
many, or which one. Adjectives can be 
used to add detail to your writing.  
 
Example: The road stretched before us as 
we left Deadman’s Cay to make our way 
to Cape Santa Maria. 
 
The long and winding road stretched 
before us as we left Deadman’s Cay to 
make our way to Cape Santa Maria where 
the powdery sand meets crystal clear 
waters. 
 
Adjectives may be used to compare two 
things that may be the same or different in 
some way.  If they are different, we 
compare them by adding ‘er’ to the end of 
the adjective (comparative). 
 
Example:  A cruise ship is longer than a 
mailboat. 
 
Use the –est form of an adjective to 
compare three or more persons, places, or 
things (superlative).  
The endings ‘er’ and ‘est’ are often used 
to compare adjectives with one syllable.  
Basic:  Have students use a 
thesaurus or dictionary to find 
synonyms for given adjectives that

A prepositional phrase includes the 
preposition, the object, and all the 
words that come between them.  The 
object of the preposition can be a noun

In the sentence – “The old lady’s gaze 
wandered over the other side of the 
Glass Window Bridge,” there are two 
prepositional phrases.     
over the other side  
of the Glass Window Bridge. 
 
Sometimes, words that appear on the 
list of prepositions may not actually 
perform the duty of a preposition in a 
sentence.  They must be followed by an 
object to be considered a preposition. 
 
Example: Frankie went outside.  
   
The word ‘outside’ is an adverb in this

A clause has a subject and a verb. 
 
There are parts of a sentence that can 
stand alone, they are referred to as 
independent clauses because they 
make a complete thought. 
 
In the sentence below there is a part of 
it that can stand alone. 
 
Since the teacher had to go to the 
office, the students conducted 
morning devotions. 
 
“The students conducted 
devotions”, makes a complete thought 
and can stand alone.  This is an 
independent clause. 
 
Dependent clauses do not make a 
complete thought. 
 
In the sentence below there is a part of 
it that cannot stand alone. 
 
Since the teacher had to go to the 
office, the students conducted 
devotions. 
Basic:  Project sentences using 
PowerPoint.  Have students take 
turns highlighting the independent 
clauses.  Have them explain what 
identifies them as independent 
clauses. 
 
Intermediate:  Provide students 
with sentences that contain 
dependent and independent 
clauses.  Have students draw a 
line to separate the independent 
clause from the dependent clause.  
Ask them to circle the 
subordinating conjunctions. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
respond to questions by including 
dependent and independent 
clauses in their answers.

“Since the teacher had to go to the 
office”, does not make a complete 
thought and is known as a dependent 
clause, because it needs the rest of the 
sentence to make sense.  It cannot 
stand on its own. 
 
The word ‘since’ in the sentence is 
known as a subordinating 
conjunction.  Subordinating 
conjunctions help to join a dependent 
clause to an independent clause. 
 
There are various types of 
subordinating conjunctions:  because, 
since, if, when, until, while, after, as, 
whenever, before and although.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
When writing, it is important to use a 
variety of sentences in order to keep 
readers interested.   
 
A Simple Sentence has a subject and 
a verb and expresses a complete 
thought.  
 
Simple sentences can be expanded in 
several ways. 
 
1. Combining key information in two or 
more sentences. 
 
Example: 
 Jeff helped his mom to prepare 
a meal.  It was delicious. 
 Jeff helped his mom to 
prepare a delicious meal. 
 
2. Combining words in a series and 
phrases. 
 
Example: 
 She viewed a video on 
YouTube. She viewed a video 
on WhatsApp. 
 She viewed a video on the LMS. 
 
Basic:   Provide students with pairs 
of simple sentences that have 
related information.  Have students 
join the two simple sentences into 
one, by using a coordinating 
conjunction to combine the 
information contained in them.   
 
Intermediate:  Using two spinning 
wheels that contain nouns and 
verbs, have students spin to select 
either one noun and two verbs or 
two verbs and one noun to create 
sentences with compound subjects 
and compound predicates. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students with 
either an independent clause or a 
dependent clause and have them 
add to it in order to make a complex 
sentence. 
Have students add a few 
complex sentences to an 
essay they are currently 
writing.

Interjections are words that express 
sudden or strong emotions. 
 
Interjections are usually used as a 
greeting, an expression of surprise, or 
an expression of anger or pain. 
 
Examples:   
 
hey 
wow 
yay 
shh 
great 
ouch 
oh 
bingo 
really 
alas 
yippee 
 
 
Strong interjections are followed by 
an exclamation mark (!), and milder 
ones are followed by a comma (,). 
 
Examples: 
 "Hey! Look at that!" 
 “Oh, that looks pretty cool.” 
 
 
 
Basic:   Have students complete a 
mini virtual tour of an island.  Have 
them write a review of the island.  
They should include interjections in 
their reviews. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students use 
comic strip “balloons” to write 
cartoon conversations, using 
interjections, quotation and 
exclamation marks to tell how the 
characters speak.

Objective 3.42 Provide synonyms for given words. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Synonyms are words that have the same 
or similar meanings. Synonyms are 
valuable tools for readers and writers as 
they can make writing more interesting and 
enriching. 
 
Examples:   
1. dirty – filthy, unclean  
2. sad – depressed, unhappy 
3. abrupt – quick, sudden 
4. grant – allow, permit 
 
Remember, words may have the same 
dictionary meaning, but certain synonyms 
have strong feelings and images attached. 
These words can impact the audience 
positively or negatively. 
 
For example, the synonyms ‘filthy’ and 
‘unclean’ both describe something that is 
‘dirty’. However, an object that is ‘filthy’ 
seems to be in a worse state than an 
object that is “unclean”. 
 
It is important that good readers and writers 
carefully select the correct synonym to 
invoke the right emotions and images. 
 
Basic:  Using emojis, have 
students write a pair of 
synonym words for each emoji 
shown.  
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
record words after skimming 
selected passages, including 
newspapers, magazines, etc.  
Have them cut out the words 
and use them to begin a 
synonym word bank.  
 
Advanced:  Provide students 
with a menu from a restaurant 
that includes a description of 
the meals that are available.

Prewriting – The writer brainstorms 
ideas about a particular topic and 
organizes thoughts using a web or 
outline. 
 
Writing – The writer follows the 
outline and begins writing, by adding 
details to those ideas in the plan. 
 
Revising – The writer reads the 
essay and shares it with others to get 
their feedback.  The writer adjusts the 
essay based on the feedback and 
focuses on using more vivid 
vocabulary.

4. Persuasive/Opinion Writing - 
This type of writing expresses how 
the writer feels about a particular 
subject and attempts to get others 
to feel the same way.

Before writing there are several 
prewriting steps to follow: 
 
1. Generate ideas.  Strategies that 
can be utilized to help generate 
ideas include: peer discussions, 
brainstorming, grouping ideas that 
are alike, conducting research in 
textbooks or on the internet, 
talking to people who might be 
knowledgeable about the topic, 
conducting a survey, making a list 
etc. 
 
2. Select the best ideas.  Review 
the ideas and then make a 
selection based on those that are 
most important, most interesting 
and have information that is 
readily available. 
 
3. Refine ideas.  Ask leading 
questions that will give specific 
details on which the writer can 
elaborate:  Who?  What?  When?  
Where?  Why?  How? 
 
Basic: Ask students to create 
a list of famous pirates.  Have 
them select one on which to 
write.  
 
Intermediate:    Have students 
research information on the 
physical appearance of pirates.  
Ask them to select one feature 
on which to write.  Have them 
provide examples. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
brainstorm what they know 
about pirates.  Have them 
group certain ideas that are 
alike.  Ask them to select one 
aspect on which to write.  They 
can add details to their writing 
by asking the 5Ws and 1H 
questions (Who?  What?  
When?  Where?  Why?  
How?) and by including 
examples. 
 
Have students show the 
process that they used to 
narrow their ideas on a 
particular topic.

Sequence is the order in which things 
happen or should happen.  Sequential 
order is very important when one is 
relaying a story, writing directions or 
instructions for performing a particular 
task and describing something. 
 
 Before Words: ‘formerly’ and ‘prior 
to’ 
 
 Words that Show First: ‘initially’ 
and ‘originally’ 
 
 Words that Show Next: ‘shortly 
after’ and ‘a few seconds later’ 
 
 Words that Show Last: ‘to finish’ 
and ‘in conclusion’ 
 
Another way to put ideas in order is to 
use space order particularly when 
describing the location of something. 
Space order tells about something from 
top to bottom or from left to right or 
vice versa.   
 
Prepositions like ‘below’ and ‘beside’ 
relay specific images. 
Compare and contrast order tells how 
Basic: Select ten random 
pictures from a magazine or 
newspaper. Place the 
students in small groups and 
have them examine the 
pictures, then put the pictures 
in an order that tells a story. 
Have each group share their 
arrangements of pictures and 
stories.  
 
Intermediate: Have students 
choose a household chore. 
Have them write a detailed 
explanation of the steps about 
how this chore should be 
completed.  
 
Advanced: Have students 
identify the nearest restaurant 
or take-a-way close to the 
school.  Have them write the 
directions that they would give 
to a delivery person if they 
wanted to place an order to be 
delivered to them at school.    
Have students write an 
essay where the 
sequencing of ideas is very 
important.  Use a rubric to 
assess the sequencing of 
ideas and the transitional 
words used.

Resources 
An essay is divided into several 
paragraphs.  A good paragraph has 
a topic sentence that clearly states 
the main idea.  The other sentences 
in the paragraph provide the details 
that support that idea.  
 
Good paragraphs also have 
transitional words and phrases that 
show clear relationships or 
connections between ideas, 
sentences or paragraphs.  There are 
three main types of transitions. They 
are transitions of time, comparison 
and contrast and transitions for 
exemplifying. 
 
Time:  first, then, next, before, finally,

paragraph and identify the topic 
sentence.  Have them spot the 
supporting detail that does not

up the main idea of the paragraph. 
 
Narrative Writing – When telling a 
story, the topic sentence should 
indicate what the story will be about.  
The supporting details should all 
provide information related to that 
topic. Do not include un-related 
information. 
 
Example:  My birthday party was a 
disaster.  To begin with, all of my 
friends came late.  Then, there were 
no candles for the cake and most 
important of all, no one bought 
presents.  I just want this day to end. 
 
Descriptive Writing – The topic 
sentence should tell what is being 
described.  The supporting details 
should provide vivid descriptions of 
that person, place, thing or animal. 
 
Example:  The beach in Orange 
Creek, Cat Island is gorgeous!  The 
water is crystal clear.  At the right 
tide, white sand dunes can be seen 
poking out of the water.  Among them 
you may find tiny crabs, shells and 
other treasures. The sunset gives it

Expository Writing:   
If your purpose is to inform your 
reader, your supporting details 
should be facts.   
 
Example:  The crawfish season in 
The Bahamas is from 1st August to 
31st March.  It is important to 
establish a crawfish season for 
several reasons.  First, it allows the 
crawfish time to reproduce and for 
the babies to grow.  Secondly, it 
ensures that we do not consume too 
much crawfish which might cause 
them to become extinct.  Finally, it 
also ensures that some crawfish are 
there to perform their jobs of keeping 
the reefs clean.  If we follow these 
rules, we can enjoy crawfish for a 
long time. 
 
Persuasive Writing:  If the purpose 
is to persuade, then the topic 
sentence should clearly state the 
opinion of the writer on a particular 
topic and then have solid reasons in 
the details to support that viewpoint.

The introduction of an essay is key as 
its function is to capture the attention 
of the readers, to draw them into the 
piece and to provide the topic 
sentence.  There are many ways to 
begin a piece.  The writer has to 
decide which one would be best for 
the type of writing and the topic.

The conclusion of a writing piece 
brings everything to an end in a way 
that is satisfying for readers. A good 
writer does not have to “announce” 
that it is the “end” but should move 
the readers through the piece in such 
a way that they realize the piece is 
concluding.

Voice refers to how much of the 
writer can be felt in a piece.  Is the 
writer interested and passionate 
about what is being written?   
 
The work of many famous authors 
can be recognized by their voice 
and writing style.  
 
The writer’s voice comes through in 
the tone and mood of the piece.  
Tone refers to the feeling that an 
author creates.  Is the piece 
serious? Playful? angry? etc.  
 
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the piece.  
Is the reader happy? sad? fearful?  
It is important that the tone matches 
the message that the writer is trying 
to send.  If the subject is serious for 
example, the language should not 
be light or funny.

songs. Ask students to close their

Resources 
The viewpoint from which material is written 
affects the voice.  Writing can be done from 
different perspectives.  Be careful when 
writing that you do not move from one 
perspective to another. 
 
First Person – This perspective uses 
pronouns like I, me, my, mine, and myself 
to tell the story.  The story is only being told 
from one person’s perspective.  Because it 
is personal, an easy connection can be 
made with the reader. 
 
Second Person – This viewpoint uses 
pronouns like you and yours.  The story is 
being told by someone who is looking on. 
 
Third Person – He, she, it and they are 
used when writing from this perspective.  
When writing from this viewpoint, the writer 
is the person who is looking on.  Readers 
get to experience the inner thoughts of the 
characters.   
 
Personification – This is when the writing 
is done from the perspective of an animal or 
an object.  This is accomplished by giving 
the animal or object human characteristics 
such as speaking or gesturing. 
Basic: Show students the silent 
commercial from The Guardian 
that shows an incident from three 
different perspectives.  Stop the 
video after the first and second 
perspectives to allow students a 
chance to share what they think is

perspective and reflect on how 
their perspectives differed from 
what was really happening.

Writers often use dialogue in their 
narrative pieces to make them more 
interesting.  Quotation marks are 
used to set apart the exact words of 
the speaker from the rest of the 
sentence. One of the quotation marks 
appears at the beginning of what was 
said and the other at the end.  The 
first word in a quote is capitalized. 
 
Example:  
“Should we wait?” I asked. 
 
Commas are used to separate who is 
speaking from what is being said.  
 
Example:   
“Ricky,” she shouted, “Look at that 
lovely specimen on the rock.” 
 
We drank the lemonade slowly, “That 
was refreshing!” Jack exclaimed. 
 
Quotation marks are used to identify 
the title of a song or a piece of writing. 
The first quotation mark goes at the 
beginning of the title and the second 
quotation mark at the end of the title.

narrative essay should have an 
introduction, body, and a conclusion. The 
general characteristics of a narrative 
include:  
 Characterization  
 Setting  
 Plot structure   
o Introduction  
o Development  
o Conclusion 
   
Characters are the people or animals in a 
story.  The protagonist is the word used to 
describe the hero. The antagonist is the 
villain in the story. Time should be spent 
developing descriptions of major 
characters.  Use specific words to 
describe some of their unique physical 
characteristics as they relate to their face, 
hair and body.  Also give insight into their 
character traits by detailing their actions 
and using interesting words. 
 
Examples:  
 Brave – bold, valiant 
Basic: Provide student with pictures of 
famous pirates. Have them brainstorm 
and write ideas about what is going on 
in the picture. Students should then 
write a story based on that picture, 
making sure that they sequence their 
ideas appropriately. Special attention 
should be given to describing the 
setting, describing the characters in the 
story and developing the plot. 
  
Intermediate: Provide students with 
information about the history of the 
Lucayans. Have them research the 
history and cultural significance of the 
Lucayans in The Bahamas and create 
their own historical narratives. 
  
Advanced: Have students develop 
interview questions they would ask an 
elderly person about his/her life.  Have 
them interview someone aged 65 or 
older and write a narrative using that 
person's voice. Special attention should 
be given to describing the setting of 
various events, describing the 
characters in the story and developing 
the plot in a seamless way. 
 
Have students 
compose a 
narrative, inclusive 
of story elements, 
following a 
standardized 
prompt.  Use a 
rubric to evaluate 
their essay.

The setting is the time and place where 
the story takes place.  Use the senses to 
tell what can be seen, heard, felt, tasted, 
or smelled.   
 
Provide evidence of the time of day.  This 
can be stated clearly in the piece.

It can also be left up to the reader to infer 
the time of day.  
Example:  The sun was directly overhead 
as they began their walk to the sandy 
beach.  
  
In the body of the writing, time should be 
taken to develop the plot.  The plot tells 
what the problem in the story is and how it 
is resolved.  This is the time to use action 
and dialogue to provide information about 
the characters. Sentences should be 
linked using transitions.  
  
The end of the story or conclusion wraps

A descriptive essay is a group of 
paragraphs that can describe a person, 
place, event, or idea.  The author uses 
descriptive details, phrasing, and literary 
devices to make the writing come alive 
and make it easier for the reader to 
visualize what the writer is describing.   
 
A descriptive essay should have a 
captivating introduction that provides the 
reader with an overview of what the 
essay will be about.  The body of the 
essay should provide specific details 
about what is being described.  The 
writer should end with a concluding 
thought about the thing, place or person 
that was described.    
 
There are several strategies that authors 
use when writing descriptively.  The 
words that are used to describe, should 
be carefully selected so that they convey 
detailed images to the readers. 
 
 Show Me, Don’t Tell Me is a strategy 
that author’s use.  For example, 
instead of saying that a building is old 
and unkempt, author’s use words to 
Basic: Have students write 
sentences where they have to 
indicate that a person or thing is in a

Using these descriptive details, have 
students individually compose a 
descriptive essay about the 
Bahamian dish. This can be written 
on a paper plate. Display their plates 
around the room.

Example: 
Cobwebs hung over the ceiling 
above the creaky stairs and on the 
dusty windows that were peppered 
with tiny holes. 
 
 Sensory details are words used to 
appeal to the five senses.  
 
Example:  As I passed Mr. Sawyer’s 
house, there they were…  the 
biggest, sweetest, darkest, purple 
sea grapes in the world!  They hung 
in long, heavy clusters just over the 
wooden fence.  Like a magnet, I was 
drawn to them.  As I got closer to the 
tree, I stepped on a few that had 
fallen to the ground.  A dark, purple 
liquid oozed out of them causing a 
strong, fruity scent to fill the air. 
 
 Literary Devices are also used as a 
tool for making writing interesting.  
There are several of them that can be 
used. 
 
o Similes are comparisons that use 
like or as. Example:  He ran as 
Bahamas. Have student groups 
compose a script for a commercial of 
at least two paragraphs, to entice 
visitors to come to The Bahamas. 
Students can create a video or 
perform their commercial in class. 
Peers can provide feedback. 
 
Have students listen to radio 
advertisements and their jingles 
(B.O.B, Wendy’s, Domino’s Pizza 
etc.) Have students discuss their use 
of descriptive details and use of 
literary devices.  Have student 
groups compose a jingle for a radio 
advertisement of at least two verses, 
to appeal to the listening audience. 
Students can create a video or

The Body of the Essay: This is where 
the writer develops the reasons to 
support his/her opinions.  Each 
paragraph in the body should represent 
one of those reasons with supporting 
evidence.    
 
Writers normally present their reasons 
in order of importance.  They begin 
with the most important reason to 
support their opinion and then present 
the others in descending order.  
Several persuasive techniques can be 
used to develop the body of the 
persuasive essay. 
 
Using Facts: Using information that is 
true to strengthen your position and 
explanations.

“Earth is considered the most valuable 
planet in the solar system. Billions of 
people live on Earth using its resources 
like oxygen, water and food sources. 
Therefore, I agree...”

something. 
Example:  'the greatest’, ‘the most’, ‘the 
best’ etc.  
 
Data: Writing with numbers, 
percentages, fractions, and quantities 
to make your explanations appear 
more believable. 
Example:    
Do you know that New Providence 
uses 11 million gallons of ground water 
per day?

ORAL PRESENTATION RUBRIC 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the oral presentation skills of students in Grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors 
are so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: content and delivery. This gives flexibility of use, as teachers and students can decide whether to focus on one aspect 
of an oral presentation or both sections.

USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEACHING OF READING 
 
 
THE READING PROCESS  
 
The reading process aims to provide readers with a systematic framework to monitor and guide their thinking, understanding, 
and response to a text. The overarching goal is for learners to eventually apply this process with automaticity inside and outside 
the classroom environment. However, to achieve this goal, readers must have multiple opportunities to observe this process 
being effectively applied to various texts and be allowed to use this method with guided support.  
 
The following Guide Steps for The Reading Process can be placed on individual bookmarks or posted on a classroom chart 
for ease of reference by students. 
 
BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
 Scan the Text. Ask yourself: 
o Is this text fiction or non-fiction?  
o Scan the cover, title, chapter 
headings, and pictures of a 
fictional text. 
o Scan the headings, bold print, 
and illustrations of a non-fictional 
text. 
o Skim read a few of the words. 
 
 
Think about what you know already 
about this topic.*  
 
 
Make predictions about what the 
 Read the text in chunks.  
 
 Stop and check if you understood 
what was read. Ask yourself: 
o What has happened so far? What 
important information was given 
already? 
o How am I feeling about what I am 
reading? 
o Do I need to re-read any 
confusing parts? 
o Can I see a clear picture in my 
mind of what is being shared? 
o Are the illustrations helping me to 
 Summarize and reflect on the main 
ideas of what you read. Ask yourself: 
o Did I learn any new information or 
ideas? 
o Do I have any burning questions 
left unanswered about this topic? 
 
 Connect it to your real life. Ask 
yourself: 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something else I read? 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something I have experienced 
before?

BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
text may be about.  
 
 
Think about what you may learn, 
feel, or encounter in this text. 
 
understand what I am reading? 
o Were my predictions correct? If 
not, what is my new prediction? 
 
 Figure out only important unknown 
words. Ask yourself: 
 Are there any context clues or 
word parts to help figure out the 
meaning?    
 Evaluate what you read. Ask 
yourself: 
o Did I agree or disagree with these 
ideas? 
o Have I changed my mind or 
feelings about this topic? 
 
 
*NOTE: Pay careful attention to the student’s responses here and determine if the reader has sufficient background 
knowledge about the topic to understand what is about to be read. If it seems that the reader does not, pause here and 
provide learning experiences to build knowledge before reading.  
 
 
BASAL READERS 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-levelled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate 
reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension 
skills, and vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journeys 


265 
 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
THE LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE APPROACH 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the 
board or chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the Language Arts 
components (speaking, listening, writing, and reading) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teacher’s observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read 
orally. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps 
the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 


266 
 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading focuses on developing readers’ ability to independently apply both strategies and skills in context. Readers are 
arranged in groups of four to six based on their instructional reading level and provided more targeted reading instruction and 
support. The instructional sessions are focused on the students’ use of multiple strategies or skills in context.  
 
BASIC ROUTINE FOR USING GUIDED-READING INSTRUCTION 
1. 
Conduct a diagnostic assessment of readers. 
5. Provide direct instruction or coaching on a specific 
strategy or skill. 
2. 
Group students according to their reading levels. 
6. Offer meaningful activities to the rest of the class while 
engaged with a group. 
3. 
Select a variety of texts at the instructional level for each 
group. 
7. Conduct ongoing reading-level assessments to track 
progress. 
4. 
Allow students during group sessions to read the entire 
text or sections. 
8. Provide individual or peer-led instruction to students who 
require further instruction. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings about the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, 


267 
 
science and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialised the subject matter becomes, the more demand for 
reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  A lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ abilities and interests, and be ready to help students find the right books at the 
right time.  Learning students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can 
be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage 
students to visit their school libraries. 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least a 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate.

SAMPLE READING ENRICHMENT DAY MENU 
 
The Power of Choice! People are naturally more motivated to participate in an activity when given individual choice, and 
learning strategies are built on this tendency. They are flexible enough to be used with any content, ability, or grade level. Here 
is a sample of a Reading Learning Menu that can be used on Enrichment Day. Students are to complete all activities from the 
‘Must Do’ category and choose reading activities from The ‘Can Do’ category according to their preference. 
 
MUST DO 
CAN DO 
In a nutshell 
 
Read a literary piece. 
Write a 10-word summary 
of the pages (or book) you 
have just read. 
Perfect Prediction 
 
Start a new book. Before 
you begin, make three 
predictions based on the 
front cover. 
Setting 
 
Draw a picture of the setting 
of a book you read. 
Locate Them 
 
As you read, underline the 
nouns, circle the adjectives, 
and highlight the action 
verbs. 
Vlog 
 
Read a book, and then 
make a video, giving a 
summary of the book. Be 
prepared to share your 
video with the class.

recording on television or 
the news, and then write 
five sentences about what 
you understood and heard. 
Illustrator 
 
Read a book, and then 
design a front cover for it.

DAILY ROUTINE FOR VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION 
 
Vocabulary is the gateway to comprehension, and greater word knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding of a text. While 
this is true, it is impossible to teach the meaning of every word to students. Therefore, vocabulary instruction in the classroom 
should be reserved for words that would have the greatest impact on the comprehension of a text. When learning the meaning 
of an unknown word, the definition is only the first step. Students must have multiple opportunities to engage with the word and 
be able to use it in different forms and contexts. Below is a basic 5–10-minute daily routine for vocabulary instruction for 
unknown words:

GAMES 
DISCUSSION / 
PRESENTATION 
Give direct instruction 
on the meaning of the 
word. Provide 
descriptions, 
illustrations, and 
examples of the word 
usage in everyday life. 
 
Allow students to use 
pictures, words, or body 
movements to 
represent its meaning, 
description, 
explanation, or 
example. Encourage 
creativity. 
Provide vocabulary 
activities to deepen the 
experience (examples / 
non-examples, 
analogies, related 
words, word parts, 
compare and contrast 
meanings with other 
words, etc.). 
Play vocabulary games 
with the focused words 
and other familiar 
words. 
Have students present 
their understanding of 
the word and its usage 
to a partner or another 
audience. Encourage 
creativity. 
NEXT STEP: The new vocabulary can now be added to the classroom word wall or the students’ personalized spelling log. Be 
sure to continuously revise these words in a fun way!

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL: HANDWRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRIC 
OVERALL LEGIBILITY 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the legibility of students’ writing in grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors are so 
detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two sections: 
letter formation and presentation. This gives the flexibility of use, as teachers and students can focus on one aspect of their 
handwriting or both sections during assessments.

Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit


iv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 –  2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
  
 
 
Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 


xi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection.

A DISCUSSION 


xii 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example, Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics. 
 
Concepts 
 
 
 
Scheme or plan for Mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and fractions,  
 
Content Standards   
            Cover what students are to learn in various subject areas, such as Mathematics and Science.  
 
Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three.

xv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
                                                                                                                       
 
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


xvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

BENCHMARKS: GRADES 4 - 6 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xx
 
 
Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at 
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended. 
 
 
 
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.  
 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxii
 
 
 
FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested. 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS

 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1-6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students.

SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL

The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment. 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES  


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxvii
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of understanding than those under Understand. 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
  putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
  production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three  distracters.  
 
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, or a 
multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxix
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical 
thinking skills.  Further, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in 
working with timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various 
components of the examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques 
and timed tests/ quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently 
write National Examinations.

   In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                  
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful bay relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life. 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics; 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxxi
 
 
 
 
Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
i. 
Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The 
next day, discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
ii. 
Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
iii. 
Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
iv. 
 Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
v. 
Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
vi. 
Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the    
             most points?); and 
 
    vii.   Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxxii
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can  
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed  
 
delete extraneous information  
 
identify the parts in the question  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information  
 
share student-generated questions  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers   
 
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
**NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

23 400 836 
                                       3 =  3 
23 317 600         
There are the same number of millions. 
Step 3: compare the hundred thousands.  
23 400 836 
                                      4 > 3 
23 317 600 
Four hundred thousand is greater than 
three hundred thousand.

3. Compare and order whole 
numbers, fractions, and decimals 
using < , >, and  = (continued) 
 
 Line up the decimal points. 
Compare the digits in the 
greatest place. 
             1.23 
 
0.98 
           0 < 1 
 
            1.28 
Since 0  <   1, then  0.98 is the least 
number. 
       
Step 2: Compare the tenths. 
                 1.23 
 
                 1.28                   2 = 2 
There is the same number of 
tenths. 
 
Step 3: Compare the hundredths 
            1.23 
 
            1.28                        3 > 8 
So, the order from least to greatest 
is 0.98; 1.23; 1.28 
 
Students use number line to order 
numbers. 
Example:  9.4; 9.63; and 9.27 from 
greatest to least. 
 
                
 
 
So the order is 9.63, 9.4, 9.27

using < , >, and  =. 
 
 Write the decimal from greatest to 
least order. Example: 0.813; 0.6; 
0.65  
 
0.813     think    8 > 6, so 0.813 is the     
greatest 
0.6         0.600       0.6 is equivalent 
to   0.0600 
                                0.65 is equivalent 
to  0.650                
0.65       0.650    0 > 5, so 0.6 is the

 Even numbers are divisible by 2 and 
end with a digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.  
Example: 2 ;   48  ;     4 000 
 
 Odd numbers are not divisible by 2. 
Odd numbers always end with a digit of 
1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. 
Example: 47 ; 139;  47 003 
 
  Whole numbers (one of the numbers 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4 … The set of whole numbers 
go on without end.  
 
 Fractions are equal parts of a whole or a 
region. 
 
 Decimals:  Numbers with one or more 
digits to the right of the decimal point. 
 
 A square number is the product of two 
equal factors.  
Example:  7 x7 = 49; 6 x 6 = 36 
 
 To find some square numbers start by 
multiplying 1 x 1.  So 1 is a square 
number. 
 
 The square root of a number is one of 
the 2 equal factors of the product. 
 Use grids to identify fractions and

guineps to sea grapes and in a second group 24 out 
of 40 students (24/40) prefer guineps over sea 
grapes.  How do the group preference compare? 
Since 18/30 = 3/5 and 24/40 = 3/5, the same 
fraction of each group prefers guineps and sea 
grapes.

11. Convert fractions to decimals and 
vice- versa. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Understanding fractions that have a 
denominator of 10 or 100 will help you 
understand decimals. 
Example 
Write the fraction using a denominator of 
10 or 100.What decimal shows the same 
amount as ½? 
 
 ½ = ½ x 5/5 = 5/10 = 0.5 
 
So, ½ is the same as 0.5 
 
Example:  Fraction                 Decimal 
Write:       6/10                          Write: 0.6 
  Read: six tenths                  Read: six tenths 
 
 You can write a decimal for a fraction 
that has a denominator other than 10 or 
100.  
Example: 
3/5 = 0.6 
                                                   0.6 
  3 divided by 5                    5 ) 3.0           
                                            - 30 
                                                   00 
 A number line divided into 100 equal 
parts can be used to model fractions and 
decimals that name the same amount in 
tenths or hundredths. 
 Write each decimal as a fraction.

12.  Round decimals to nearest 
tenths, hundredths, and 
thousandths. 
 Rounding whole numbers and 
rounding decimals are similar 
processes. 
Remember 
    a. Find the place value to which you 
want to round. 
    b. Look at the digit to the right. 
   c. If the digit is less than 5, the digit 
in the rounding place stays the 
same. 
     d. If the digit is 5 or more, the digit 
in the rounding place is increased 
by 1. 
 
Round 6.079 to the nearest hundredth.  
Look at the thousandth place 
          ↓ 
   6.079 
   Since 9>5, the digit 7 is increased by 1 
   So 6.079 rounds to 6.08      
 
 If the number in thousandths places is 
5 or more, the number in the tenths 
place is increased by 1. 
Example:  Round 0.459 to the nearest 
tenth = 0.5 
Round 1.222 to the nearest hundredth. = 
1.22 
 
 Use a number line to round to nearest 
tenths, hundredth, and thousandths. 
 
  “What is it?” 
a. Teacher asks questions that are 
answered in groups (Its academic 
format). 
    Examples: Questions 
     1) How many tenths are in the number   
24.78? 
     2) How will you round to the nearest   
tenth?

14.  Compare and order 
decimals through 
thousandths. 
 You can use a number line or place value 
to order decimals up to thousandths. 
 
 Remember: On a number line, the numbers 
to the right are greater than the numbers to 
the left. 
 
Example: Order 0.813, 0.6, 0.65 from least to 
greatest. 
 
0.813   Think: 8>6 so 0.813 is the greatest. 
   ↓ 
     0.6         0.600   0.6 is equivalent to 0.600 
   ↓               ↓    0.65 is equivalent to 0.650 
0.65        0.650        0<5 so 0.6 is the least.    
 
Therefore from least to greatest: 0.6,  
0.65, 0.813

16. Identify L.C.M and G. C. F. 
of two numbers (Continued).  
 
 Composite numbers are numbers with 
more than 2 factors. The numbers can 
be written as a product of prime factors. 
Example: 9 = 3 x 3 ; 9 x 1 
The composite numbers are 1, 3, 9 
 
 The lowest common multiple (LCM) of 
two whole numbers is the smallest 
whole number which is a multiple of 
both.  
a. For example the  
    multiples of 10 = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,… 
    multiples of 8 = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48… 
So the least common multiple of 10 and 8 
is 40 or LCM (10, 8) = 40. 
 
 The greatest common factor (GCF) of 2 
whole numbers is the largest whole 
number which is a factor both.  
 Example: Factors of 12 = 1,2,3,4, ,12 
                Factors of  15 = 1,3,5,15 
1 and 3 are common factors. The highest 
common factor is 3. 
 Use factor trees as well to find prime 
factors.  
 
 Bowling Factors 
a. Students bowl down pins using cardinal 
numbers 0-9. 
 
b. Students make a number with the pins 
that fell. Example: pins 4 ; 0 ; 9 were 
knocked down.  Students will create 
factors of 49. 
 
c. Students find the L. C.M. and H.C.F. of 
the numbers from the fallen pins. 
  
  Note: If all pins are knocked down, 
have the student bowl or try again.

17. Write numbers as products of 
prime numbers using 
exponential notation where 
appropriate. 
 
 
 
 A prime number is a positive whole number 
that has exactly 2 positive divisors, 1 and the 
number itself.  A prime number cannot be 
factored. 
Note:  1 is not a prime number because it 
has only 1 divisor. 
 
 A composite number has more than two 
distinct factors (divisors). 
 
 The product of prime numbers can be 
represented by the prime factorization 
method. 
 Example: Write the prime factorization of 60 
   60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x  5   
   60 = 2² x 3 x 5 
 
 You can use a factor tree to find the prime 
factors of composite numbers. A factor tree 
of 30 
                              30 
 
                      10    x     3 
 
                  2  x   5    x     3 
 
                   So 30 =  2 x 3 x 5. 
 Write each number as a product of prime factors 
using exponential notation where appropriate. 
      1) 22                 2) 120              3) 84

19.   Estimate and create answers 
to solve single and multi-step 
problems involving addition 
and subtraction of whole 
numbers, money, fractions, 
and decimals (Continued). 
 
 
 
 
 Computational estimation is a 
process of developing an answer or 
answers that are close enough to 
enable good decision with making 
exact computations. 
 
 Exact computations can help by 
building a better sense of estimating 
answers first. 
 
 Front End Estimation 
This is where you use only the most 
important digits, ignore the rest. 
Example: 
    $4.092                      $4.000 
    $7.351                      $7.000 
+  $8.973                 +  $8.000 
    ______                     $19.00    
 
 Adjusting and compensation 
Students should be taught that values 
being analyzed can be seen as a little 
more, a lot more, or a little less. 
Example: Subtraction 
 
   $ 7.351               _  $7.000 
   -  4.092                   $4.000 
   $ 3.259                   $3.000 
 
 Without calculating an exact answer, 
circle the best estimate for 72 ÷ 
0.025 
       a. A lot less than 72 
 b. A little less than 72 
 c. A Little more than 72 
 d. A lot more than 72 
 
 In pairs, students create single and 
multi-step problems. Another pair in 
the class solves the problems. 
Students report findings.  
 
 Do I Have Enough? 
 a. Students are exposed to the 
classroom store where items are 
clearly priced. Students are given a 
certain amount of money to shop. 
For example, $15.00. 
 
b. Students are challenged to select 
four items that when purchased will 
leave them with more than $2.00 or 
less than a $1.00.

 Student’s question: If each box 
contains 79 juice containers, about 
how much will 5 boxes hold? 
Student A’s response: 4 x100 but 
less than 400.  Student B’s 
response: 5 x 70 is 350 but more 
than 350 
 
 Compatible numbers also called 
friendly numbers. Values are easy 
to compute mentally and seem to 
go together. For example,  7 and 3 
are compatible with 10; thus 70 
and 30 are compatible with 100 
 
 3/7 and 4/7 are compatible in the 
one whole; thus 30/70 and 40/70 
are compatible with one whole. 
 Do I Have Enough? 
a.  Students are given a certain 
     amount of money (e.g.$10.00)    
     to shop at the classroom store.  
 
b.  Students are challenged to select

20. Estimate using several 
methods including rounding. 
 Flexible numbers can be changed or 
reformulated. Round number that are 
close and easy to formulate. This is 
particularly suited for multiplication. 
 
 Clustering or averaging: 
When numbers need to be totaled, 
sometimes you can find the answer by 
estimating an average of them e.g.  
 
Estimate the total. 
                 52                       60

 Now you can take the average and 
multiply it by how many numbers you 
have added.  
 
a. Students estimate the average weekly 
temperatures. 
b.   Students can create a graph of choice   
to represent the information.

21.  Recall basic addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, 
and division facts, with a 3 
second per fact standard 
(Continued). 
 Addition order property: Changing 
the order of the addends does not 
change the sum. 
 
            9 + 7     =   16 
                addends       sum 
 
                   7 + 9 = 16 
 Zero property: When you add zero to 
a number, the sum is that number. 
12 + 0 =12    0 + 25 = 25 
 
 Subtraction Facts: Addition and 
subtraction are related. They are 
inverse operations. There are 100 basic 
subtraction facts. These results from 
the difference between one addend and 
the sum for all one digit addends.   
 
 Grouping Property of Addition: 
When you group addends in different 
ways, the sums are the same.        
   9 + (15 + 5) = (9 + 15) + 5 
   9 +      20      =    24 + 5

Rule 
2 
Even numbers are divisible by  
2 
3 
If the sum of the digit is 
divisible by 3, then the number 
is divisible by 3.  
5 
If the last digit is a 5 or 0, the 
number is divided by 5. 
9 
If the sum of the digits is  
divisible by 9,then the number 
is divisible by 9 
10 
 If the last digit is 0, the 
number is divisible by 10. 
 
Example 
    5 766;   
Strategy: Add the digits 
5 766 → 5  + 7  + 6 + 6 = 24 
 Ask: Is 24 divisible by 3? If yes, so is 5 766.

29. Multiply and divided by 
multiples and powers of

two zeros                                        two zeros 
 
 Basic facts and patterns can be used to help 
you find products mentally.  If you want to 
find the total number of pennies in 7 rolls 
of pennies with each roll having 50 pennies 
 
 50 Think 
 x7              50 = 5 x 10, or    5 tens 
 350            7 x   5 tens     =  35 tens 
                   35 tens           =  35 x10 or  350 
Examples 
7 x  20      =   140 
7  x 200    =     1.400 
7  x 2.000 =     14.000 
 
As the number of zeros in a factor increases, 
the number of zero in the product increases.

30. Check answers to multiplication  
      and division problems using     
      inverse operations. 
 Multiplication and division are inverse 
operations or opposite to each other.  
Example: 
4  x   6  = 24          24 ÷ 4 = 6 
 
  A set of related multiplication and 
division equations using the same 
numbers is a fact family. 
Example: 
 9 x 4 = 36     36 ÷ 4 = 9 
 4 x 9 = 36     36 ÷ 9 = 4 
 Inverse Moment

know which operation to do first. 
 Order of operations is used to solve 
expressions with more than one 
operation. 
 Steps to consider: 
a. First, operate inside the 
parentheses. 
b. Next, multiply and divide from left 
to right. 
c. Then, add and subtract from left to 
right. 
Example                               
3 (9 + 7) ÷ 2 
3   x 16    ÷ 2 
48   ÷  2 = 24

32. Multiplying decimals by a 
decimal number. 
 Steps to multiply decimals 
Step 1: Multiply the numbers and 
ignore the decimal points. 
 
 Step 2: Count up how many number 
of digits that come after the decimal 
points in both factors. 
 
 Step 3: Place the decimal in the 
product so that the same number of 
digits comes after the decimal point in 
the answer. 
 
 Step 4: (Optional) Estimate the 
answer to see if your answer and the 
placement of your decimal point are 
reasonable. 
Example:  23.8 x 4.1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, 23.8 x 4.1 = 97.58

37.  Read and write Roman 
       Numerals to D. 
 
  Roman numerals are written using seven 
different letters:  
I - 1  
V -5  
X - 10  
L - 50  
C -100  
D - 500  
M- 1000  
 
 The seven letters are used to make up 
thousands of others. For example, the 
Roman numeral for two is written as II 
which is just two one's written side by 
side. 
 
 Rule 1: When a smaller symbol is after a 
greater symbol, it's added. 
 
 Rule 2: If a symbol comes after itself, it's 
added.  
 
 Rule 3: When a smaller symbol appears 
before a greater symbol, it is subtracted.  
 
 Rule 4: The same symbol cannot be used 
more than three times in a row.

1. Investigate, describe and extend 
numerical and geometric patterns 
including: triangular numbers, 
perfect squares, patterns formed 
by powers of tens and arithmetic 
sequences (Continued). 
 
 
 
 Numerical Patterns: Patterns that are created 
using numbers. 
Example:  Division Patterns 
               80 ÷ 20 = 4 
             800 ÷ 20 = 40 
          8000 ÷ 20 = 400 
 
 Geometric Patterns: Geometric Patterns are 
patterns that are created using geometrical 
shapes. 
 
Example:   
      a.          b.           c.          d.         e.           f.   
 
 Triangular Numbers: A pattern of numbers 
that can be shown by dots arranged in the shape 
of a triangle. Some triangular numbers are 1, 3, 
6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36 
 
 Perfect square is a number that has a whole 
number as its square root.  The square root of a 
perfect square is a whole number. For example, 
0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. are all perfect squares.

4. Estimate and measure 
perimeter of objects. 
 
The perimeter is the distance around an 
object.  You can use a formula, or 
mathematical rule, to find the perimeter. 
 
   Example:  The perimeter formula for a 
pentagon is:  
 P = a + b + c + d + e  
The length of each side is represented by a 
variable. 
 
 
Estimating is the mental process of arriving 
at a measurement without the aid of 
measuring instruments. 
 
 
One strategy in estimating measurement is 
comparing a referent. If you know the 
perimeter of a student desk, then you can 
estimate the perimeter of two students’ 
desk.  
Find the perimeter: 
 
                   
 
 
Perimeter = a + b + c + d + e 
P = 14m +17m + 13m + 15m + 16m 
P = 75m 
 
 Give students many examples of 
squares and rectangles to find the 
perimeter. Discuss, “has anyone 
found a short cut to calculating the 
perimeter of a rectangle or a 
square?” 
 
 Measure and record the perimeter 
of certain areas in their school.  
Example. Office 
 
                                        20 1/8' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P = a + b + c + d + e

6. Identify and describe the 
circumference of a circle. 
 The diameter of a circle is the 
length of the line through the center 
and touching two points on its edge.   
 Pi is π = 3.14  or 22/7. 
 
 π originated from studies of the 
relationship between the 
circumference and the diameter.  
 
 The circumference C equals π times 
the diameter d or c = πd.  
 
 Formula for circumference of 
a circle is c = πd or C = 2πr 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After a table is complete, have students add their 
data to a class list (on an overhead or at the

occupies is called volume. Volume is measured 
in cubic units. 
 
 You can find volume in two ways: (a) count the 
numbers of cubes as you build a 6 cube x 2 
cube x 3 cube rectangular prism or (b) multiply 
the length, width and height of the rectangular 
prism to find the volume in cubic units.

12.Create and solve problems with 
capacity measures. 
 Capacity is an attribute of a 
container that can be introduced to 
young children by asking, “Which 
holds more?” 
Capacity  
1 liter (L) = 1,000 milliliters  
1 metric cup = 250 milliliters. 
 
    1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 3 teaspoons  
(tbsp)  
     1 cup ( c )   = 8 fluid ounces (fl.  
oz)  
     1 pint (pt.)    =  2cups  
     1 quart (qt)  =  2pints  
     1 gallon(gal) = 4 quarts 
 
Examples 
How many quarts are in 2 gallons? 
           2 gal =   ____qt  
 
gallons     quarts in 1gallon        quarts 
     ↓                               ↓                  ↓ 
     2         x                    4         =       8 
So,     2 gallons equals       4 quarts

13. Use standard units to 
estimate and measure 
mass. 
 Mass is the amount of matter in an object  
 
       Mass        /         Weight 
1 grams(g) = 1 000(mg)        1 pound   =   160oz  
1kg   = 1 000 grams             1 ton  =     2 000lbs 
 
Example 
How many grams are equivalent to 2 
kilograms? 
Think: there are 1,000 grams in 1 kg  
2 kg =   2  x  1 000   =  2 000g  
So,  2 000g are equivalent to 2 kg

 You can begin describing the time 
of occurrence by giving a time 
span. For example, it happened 
today, in the morning, in October.   
 
 Students can tell which of two 
events take longer if their lengths, 
are greatly different. If the events 
are similar in duration, children 
can tell which lasts longer if both 
events begin at the same time. 
 How long does it take you?  
a. Students work in groups to complete chart 
based on the topic.  
   b. Discuss why answers may differ.

 Degrees Fahrenheit are customary units for 
measuring temperature. 
 
 Some temperatures are less than 0°F.These are 
negative temperatures. The lowest temperature 
marked on the thermometer at the right is -10 °F 
Example 
Look at the table. How much would the 
temperature change if it dropped from the normal 
high to the normal low 
Normal high: 16  °F Normal Low -2°F 
 
 
 Fahrenheit Make-up

 4. Identify and classify 
polygons up to 10 sides 
including special 
quadrilaterals such 
rectangles, parallelogram, 
square, rhombus, kite, dart, 
trapezium (Continued). 
 A polygon is a closed plane figure 
with straight sides. Polygons are 
named by the number of sides or 
number of angles they have. 
 
Example: triangle, quadrilateral, 
pentagon, octagon           
                                                                
         Triangle           =    3 sides 
                                        3 angles 
 
          Quadrilateral  =     4 sides 
                                        4 angles 
 
          Pentagon        =     5 sides 
                                        5 angles 
 
  A parallelogram is a quadrilateral 
whose opposite sides are parallel 
and congruent. 
 
  Hexagon     =   6 side and 6 angles     
  Heptagon    =   7 sides and 7 angles     
  Octagon      =   8 sides and 8 angles    
  Nonagon     =   9 sides and 9 angles     
 Decagon     = 10 sides and 10 angles 
 Can You Find?

mode, and range of a 
set of data. 
 
 
The mean or average is the number 
found by dividing the sum of a set 
of numbers by the number of 
addends. 
 
 
The mode is the number that 
occurs most often. There may be 
more than one mode, or there may 
be no mode. 
 
 
The median is the middle number. 
Remember to arrange the numbers 
in order from least to greatest.  
 
 
The range is the difference 
between the greatest and the least 
values in a set of data. 
 In groups, students use different 
graphs where they find the mean, 
median, mode, and range of a set of 
data.

PREFACE 
 
We live in a world that is scientifically and technologically oriented – a world of phenomenal scientific advancement and innovations. As The Bahamas 
keeps pace with this advancement, our children must be exposed to effective, comprehensive Science Education early in life. We must take advantage of their 
innate curiosity and zeal for learning about the environment before it diminishes. 
 
Science is important because it links to technology and industry, which are areas of priority for a country’s development. Science provides ways of 
making sense of the world systemically. Opportunities must be provided for our children to experience science at an early age. It is important for them 
to understand scientific ways of thinking and to have adequate knowledge of science if they are to keep pace with the technological advances and 
innovations of the 21st Century. 
 
The production of the revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines consisted of local educators who accepted the challenge of producing this document 
– a third document for the Department of Education: Science Unit (August 2001, June 2010, and December 2021). The Production Team has ensured that 
the purposes of developing sciences are met. A few of these aims are to communicate, to relate science to everyday life, and to explore, apply and 
investigate scientific and technological knowledge and ideas. 
 
In accomplishing these aims, instructional facilitators will guide students through the use of various communication modes, developing their awareness of 
the importance of science in life. Students will be encouraged to make decisions based on their knowledge of science and issues such as personal health and 
well-being, safety and the preservation of the environment. These students will be able to appreciate that experimentation is not judged by success or failure, 
but by the knowledge, which is gained from the process. 
 
The revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines grades 1-6 boasts several new features. The previous Primary Curriculum consisted of three stands; we 
introduced a fourth strand –  “Environmental Science.” More focus was given to the integration of technological skills in developing the basic concepts, skills 
and activities in the Life, Earth, Physical and Environmental Sciences. Also noteworthy in the document are the deliberate efforts to highlight skills and 
attitudes that we wish for our students to develop. 
 
When the guidelines in this revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines are effectively implemented, they will ensure that our students have the 
foundation of basic scientific concepts and principles that develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge necessary for them to successfully work and live 
in the 21st Century.

PRIMARY SCIENCE MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Primary Science Unit recognizes the place of science in everyday human affairs and aim for scientific literacy that is operational in understanding 
oneself. We seek to provide a level of understanding and scientific literacy that will prepare students to be informed and participative citizens who are able to 
make judgments and decisions regarding science applications that may have social, health or environmental impacts. 
 
 
 
BROAD OBJECTIVES 
 
The team responsible for effecting the necessary revisions to the Primary Science Curriculum holds the view that the curriculum should achieve two 
broad objectives: 
 Provide courses of study that challenge participants to acquire scientific skills and academic standards consistent with emerging global 
workforce requisites while simultaneously promoting self-confidence, character strengthening, creativity and personal initiative. 
 Improve the use of technology in the teaching/learning process. 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 
 
To provide opportunities that expose and engage students in The Bahamas in acquiring scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes which will enhance 
critical thinking, problem-solving and organizational skills. In so doing, students will be able to participate in varied scientific and technological 
careers in the global environment, as well as realize the impact that they make on the natural world and appreciate the need for its sustainability.

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

3. Classify 3 
groups of 
mollusks. 
There are 3 types/groups of 
mollusks: 
 
No shell/cephalopods: 
These  mollusks have no shell 
covering the outside of its body 
(e.g. slug, octopus, squid) 
 One shell/gastropods: 
These mollusks have one shell. 
The shell has a “trapdoor” 
covering the opening. The 
animal can pull its head back 
into the opening and the trap 
door closes.  In this way, the 
animal is protected from 
enemies. The queen conch is an 
example of a mollusk that is 
used in many Bahamian dishes. 
Other examples of mollusks 
include, snails, curds, whelks. 
 Two shells/bivalves:  
These mollusks have a double 
shell that is hinged. They get 
their food by filtering it from 
the water. Tube like parts are 
used for feeding (e.g. oyster, 
clam, mussel, scallops).  
Place the circle inside the

The spine is made up of the

The ribs protect the heart, lungs and

We take care of our skeletal system 
by exercising, resting, eating healthy 
and food rich in calcium. 
Calcium is a mineral that helps 
bones grow strong and healthy. Dairy 
products like milk, cheese and yogurt 
contain calcium. Dark green 
vegetables like spinach, broccoli and 
collard greens also contain calcium. 
Exercise makes bones healthy. 
Sitting up straight with good posture 
and never sitting slumped over also 
keeps bones healthy and makes them 
grow and develop properly.

1. Explain how

affect health. 
2. Infer how 
proper nutrition 
is related to 
good health. 
 Nutrition is providing the 
body with chemicals 
called nutrients that the 
body needs to stay 
healthy and to carry out 
its functions (do work). 
 Nutrients are materials 
the body uses for making 
new tissue, protecting our 
systems and giving us 
energy. 
 There are many different 
nutrients that the body 
needs. Proteins, 
vitamins, minerals, fibre 
and carbohydrates are 
nutrients. 
A nutritional deficiency is 
the lack of a certain nutrient 
in the diet. These 
deficiencies can cause the 
blood to carry less oxygen 
than the body needs or can 
cause anaemia, which is a 
lack of iron.

Obesity: 
If you take in more food than your 
body needs, the body stores it as 
fat. Being overweight can damage 
your health. Overweight or obese 
people can develop high blood 
pressure, heart disease and Type 2 
diabetes 
Water: 
Your body also needs water. You 
should drink 6 to 8 glasses of water 
a day. 
Water helps to: 
 
transport nutrients to the 
cells; 
 
build new cells; 
 
keep body temperature 
stable; 
 
carry waste out of the body; 


sedimentary rock. Scientists 
called paleontologists 
study fossils. Wood, bones, 
teeth and shells are 
preserved or saved by being 
buried. As the sediments 
harden, the remains become 
trapped in rock and form 
fossils. 
 
Some fossils show 
changes dead animals made 
in their surroundings. These 
are called trace fossils. 
Tracks, burrows, droppings

A mold is an imprint made by 
the outside of a dead plant or 
animal. A mould forms  when 
water washes animal or plant 
remains out of rocks. 
Sometimes sediments or 
minerals fill a mould and form 
a  cast. Whole plants or 
animals can become fossilized. 
These can be trapped by sap 
from trees, glacier ice or tar 
pits. When fossils are 
discovered, they are excavated 
or dug out and studied.

A planet’s orbit is the oval-shaped path  the 
planet travels around the sun. 
All planets are in motion. They revolve  or 
move in orbits around the sun. The 
movement of a planet along its orbit around 
the sun is called revolution. A planet’s 
year is the time it takes that planet to 
complete one orbit or one revolution 
around the sun. It takes planet Earth 365 
1/4 days to revolve around the sun. The 
seasons are a result of revolution. 
Planets rotate or spin like a top. An axis  is a 
straight line that runs through an object. The 
turning or spinning of a planet on its axis is 
rotation. The time it  takes a planet to rotate 
once on its axis is a planet’s day. The time 
of rotation differs from planet to planet, so 
the length of a day also differs. Night and 
day are the result of rotation.

The Sun 
The sun is in the center of the solar system. It is a 
star. It is 93 million miles away from the Earth.  
Stars are the only bodies that give off radiant 
energy.  It is a ball of burning gases and molten 
material. The sun is the only star in the solar system 
but there are millions of stars in the universe. We 
can only see a small portion of them with our naked 
eyes. Some stars seem to shine brighter than others. 
This is because they are closer to the Earth or 
because they give off more radiant energy.  
The sun provides heat and light to all of the 
planets. There would be no life on Earth if the sun 
stopped giving off radiant energy. Energy from the 
sun warms the Earth and allows green plants to turn 
raw materials into food (photosynthesis). 
Gravity on the sun is very strong. This is because of 
its great size. The entire solar      system can fit 
inside the sun. Gravity is the force of one object’s 
pull on another. The sun’s    gravity helps hold all 
the objects in the solar system in place or in orbit.

 
There are many other bodies 
found in outer space. The most 
common is the meteoroid. It is 
a mass of metal or stone moving 
through space. 
 
Sometimes meteoroids fall to the 
Earth. When they enter Earth’s 
atmosphere, they burst into fire. 
The streak of light produced 
passes through Earth’s 
atmosphere and is called a 
meteor or a shooting star. 
 
If any part of a meteor survives 
and reaches the Earth, it is called 
a meteorite.

A mixture is made up of two or 
more different substances. The 
substances do not change by 
being mixed. (E.g. conch salad, 
birdseed, cheeseburger, tossed 
salad, air). Mixtures can be 
separated easily using our 
fingers, a sieve, rake, shaking 
or filtering. 
A solution is a special mixture. 
It is made up of two (2) 
different substances. One 
substance is dissolved or melted 
in the other substance.

The substance that melts is called 
the solute and the substance that 
does the dissolving is called the 
solvent. When water is added to 
sugar, a solution is made. The 
sugar dissolves into smaller 
crystals then mixed in but does 
not combine with the water 
particles. 
In this solution, the sugar is the 
solute and the water is the 
solvent. Liquid solutions are 
always transparent, or clear. They 
may be coloured or colourless.

Work is done when the position 
of an object is changed either by 
using a pushing, lifting, pulling, 
dragging or dropping force. The 
object may be at rest or in motion 
when a force is applied to it. The 
force that is used to affect an 
object is produced when energy is 
used. 
There are many different forms of 
energy. Heat, light, chemical, 
sound and electrical energy are 
some forms of energy. Each 
form of energy can exist as 
energy in motion or energy at rest 
(stored energy).

A pulley is a type of simple 
machine. It is made up of a rope or 
chain and a wheel around which the 
rope fits. When you pull down on 
one rope end, the wheel turns and 
the other rope end moves up. 
A pulley that stays in one place is 
called a fixed pulley. It is used to 
raise and lower something 
lightweight such as a flag or a 
small sail.

A wheel and axle is a simple 
machine that is made up of a large 
wheel attached to a smaller wheel 
or rod. A doorknob is part of a 
wheel and axle. The large, round 
knob turns the smaller axle. The 
axle is what pulls in the latch to 
open the door. Without the large 
knob, it would be difficult to turn 
the axle. The small effort force 
you use to turn the knob becomes 
a large resulting force put out by 
the axle.

The Spiny Lobsters, better known as 
crawfish in The Bahamas, is one in a 
family of over 45 species of achelate 
crustaceans. They reproduce in the 
clean, clear tropical waters of the 
Bahamas from August 1st through 
March 31st. Lobsters live in crevices of 
rocks and coral reefs where they hide 
during the day. At night, they forage for 
snails, clams, crabs, and sea urchins. 
Lobsters are known to migrate in masses 
across the sea floor. Up to 50 lobsters 
migrate in one line. They use their 
antennae to stay together. Potential 
predators may be deterred because of 
the loud screech made as the antennae 
(whip) of one lobster rubs against a 
smooth part of the exoskeleton of 
another. 
 
When disturbed, they can swim 
backwards rapidly using the powerful 
strokes of their tails. Lobsters navigate 
by using the smell and taste of natural 
substances in the water.

Fisheries are an essential resource. About 
75% of the world’s fish catch is for 
human consumption. The demand for 
seafood has been rising globally due to 
increased awareness of seafood’s healthy 
properties. Many medicines contain 
compounds derived from marine 
organisms. The ocean provides goods, 
services, employment to millions of 
people around the world  (e.g. 
snorkeling, diving and sports fishing). 
The principal commercial fisheries in 
The Bahamas are crawfish, conch, 
shallow water scale fish like Nassau 
Grouper, jack, snappers and grunts and 
deep-water scale fish like red snapper. 
Fisheries are threatened by habitat loss, 
overfishing, pollution, introduction of 
invasive species and climate change.

In addition to the large amounts of

destructive fishing practices, and 
ocean pollution have been driving the 
world’s wild coral populations to the 
brink of extinction. 
With 75 percent of reefs under the 
threat of damage or death, there often 
seem like there is not much that 
anyone can do to save coral. However, 
scientists in different parts of the 
world, including in The Bahamas, are 
experimenting with growing corals. 
Many projects have been successful. 
They start with a live piece of coral 
which is cut into many smaller pieces. 
Those coral fragments are either glued 
onto round cement platforms roughly 
the size of drink coasters or tied to a 
PVC frame and allowed to hang in the 
water column.

1. Explain the effects 
of pollution on

3. Define the term 
marine debris. 
 
Oceans are polluted by human 
and natural means. People dump 
waste material into the ocean. 
Marine debris is waste that litters 
the ocean. Often such waste 
consists of non- biodegradable 
substances like plastics. Marine 
life eat the plastic which blocks 
their digestive tracts and causes 
starvation. Animals may also get 
trapped in marine debris and 
suffocate. 
 
 
Oil spills are another source of 
pollution. 
 
 
Chemical products such as 
fertilizers and detergents contain 
phosphorus. Phosphorus causes 
algae to grow very quickly and 
smother coral reefs. 
 
 
Scientists are working to 
develop new  kinds of plastics 
that are biodegradable and not 
harmful to marine life. 
However, ocean pollution  can 
be reduced in the following 
ways: 
 Research 
 Communication

Bahamian government began 
issuing licenses for oil drilling. 
As a result, a huge oil spill has 
occurred on the Little Bahama 
Bank which threatens 
immense damage to 10 
national parks in the area. The 
spill will also greatly affect 
tourism, our main industry in 
the Bahamas, because reefs 
and  beaches will no longer be 
usable. Have them research to 
see what other countries have 
done in similar circumstances. 
Then, simulate a clean-up and

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method 
❖ 
Cooperative Learning Technique 
❖ 
Student-centred vs. Teacher-centred Learning 
❖ 
Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles 
❖ 
Assessment Strategies 
❖ 
Information Technology Linkages

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
 Provide guidance for the students. 


 
  
 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

SCIENCE PROCESS 
Source: The American Association for the Advancement of Science 
 
BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps:

PREDICTIONS 
TEST OF PREDICTIONS

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere. 


332 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and 
teachers. As the internet is constantly changing, some websites may become non-functional, outdated or unsuitable.

An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

I. “OWL STRATEGY” 
Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic.

VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.

OVER-ARCHING GOALS 
The over-arching goal of the Primary Social Studies Curriculum of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas is to equip students with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and 
the values that will enable them to become informed and contributing members of society.  Hence, students will become socially active citizens able to affect change 
in a democratic nation in an interdependent world.  
SUB- GOAL 
HISTORY  
 Know the history of The Bahamas from the time of the Lucayans to the present 
 Encourage an awareness of current issues in The Bahamas and the interdependent world 
 Understand their historical roots to locate themselves in time 
 Accept the fact that there is a changing world so that they are able to adapt and function 
 
GEOGRAPHY 
 Understand that The Bahamas is an archipelagic country 
 Acquire and apply geographical skills, knowledge and understanding  
 Appreciate the unique differences related to the geographic placement of each Bahamian island 
 Expose students to the Bahamian Family Islands through the use of technology and field trips 
 Recognize and respect our environment and heritage, promote sustainability and conservation

SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief systems, such 
as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and beliefs? What does 
language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, sociology and anthropology, 
as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one to 
develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? How has 
the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme typically appears in 
courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things located? 
Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have for people? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to adulthood? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are maintained or 
changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by institutions? How do 
institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with sociology, 
anthropology, psychology, political science and history.

Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is power? What 
form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, structured, maintained 
and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing 
with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of the 
factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic concepts 
and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is new 
technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which is 
unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people benefit 
from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural and physical 
sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, civics and 
government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme typically 
appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. Students 
confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the balance 
between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world community? How can I 
make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, cultural anthropology and 
fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

2. Discuss the activities of pirates 
and the effects they had on the

3. Summarize the role Woodes 
Rogers played in eradicating 
the pirates from The Bahamas. 
In the 17th century (1600s), many 
buccaneers lived in the Caribbean.  
 
They were a mixed group of 
English, French and Dutch men 
and women who were 
shipwrecked and marooned off the 
coast of Hispaniola.  
 
They hunted wild boar and cattle 
and learned how to cure meat

was cured over a boucan near a 
slow burning fire. The sailors sold 
the meat to passing ships and 
therefore, they were called

had very little interest in the 
islands.  
 
People living here were expected 
to pay some of their wages to the 
Proprietors but often the people 
refused to pay.

2. Discuss the impact of 
wrecking upon communities in 
New Providence and the 
Family Islands. 
Wrecking is attracting ships to 
cays and reefs, and then taking 
away the goods on board to sell. 
 
Wrecking was a big business in 
The Bahamas in the mid-1600s. 
 
Many ships were caught in the 
tricky currents around these 
islands and they were swept ashore 
or into reefs.  
 
Sometimes wreckers deliberately 
attracted ships onto cays and reefs 
by false lights.  
 
Once the ship was wrecked, the 
goods were taken away and sold.   
 
Many people made a living from 
wrecking.

Lincoln declared a blockade on the 
ports of the southern states 
(Confederacy).  
 
These states were more plantation 
states with few industries.

Tourism began in the 1740’s in 
The Bahamas. The first tourists to 
The Bahamas were invalids who 
came to restore their health. The 
first hotel, the Royal Victoria 
Hotel was built in 1861 and this 
resulted in an increase of visitor 
arrivals. 
 
In 1900, the Colonial Hotel was 
built and the Miami - Nassau 
Winter Steamship service began.  
 
This resulted in rich and famous 
visitors.

Tourists at this time stayed in

Revenue from customs duty on 
liquor during the bootlegging 
period was used to improve 
infrastructure: deepening the 
harbor, providing running water 
and electricity in order to make 
tourists comfortable.  
 
The ordinary Bahamians, however, 
did not have these luxuries.  They 
still used outside toilets and tin 
tubs, and well manual hand pumps 
and wells. 
 
In the 1950s tourism became a

used to improve tourism through 
staff training, courtesy campaigns 
and the planning of new tourism 
programmes in hotels. Tourism is 
the number one industry in The 
Bahamas. Most of The Bahamas’ 
revenue is obtained from tourism 
and many citizens are employed in

Sponging 
The sea offers a lot of resources 
from which income can be made.  
 
A Frenchman named Gustave 
Renouard introduced sponging to 
The Bahamas.  
 
In the 1800s sponges were sold to 
Greek merchants who in turn sold 
them to other merchants who 
cleaned, clipped, dyed sorted and 
pressed them into bales to be 
exported.  
 
In 1938, a strange fungus attacked 
the sponge bed.  After the disease, 
synthetic sponges were made so 
there was little market demand for 
the natural ones.

Process of sponging: 
1. Hook sponges 
2. Soak in a Kraal (shallow 
water closure) 
3. Beaten 
4. Scraped 
 
During the hurricane season, 
fishermen are unable to go to sea 
and salt production can be 
hindered by heavy rains, therefore 
some revenue is lost.

Product. 
 
Straw is the main material 
harvested and prepared to make 
today’s straw hats and bags.   
 
Straw bags produced by Harl 
Taylor, a former local designer 
and manufacturer, have been sold 
for as high as three hundred 
dollars.  Straw is harvested, dried 
and stripped and plated into 
fanners (rolls). After products are 
made, some straw works are 
shellac to increase the longevity of 
the straw. 
 
Sisal is a large leafed plant used to 
produce fiber found in rope. After 
browning, brown grainy fibers 
were bundled and sent to rope 
making factories abroad. The plant 
is harvested, retted in brackish 
water, and then beaten on rocks 
until only the fiber remained.

ASSESSMENT 
1. Differentiate between domestic 
and international tourism.  
 
Domestic tourists travel within 
their own country. Example, island 
to island, state to state, or province 
to province. 
 
Domestic tourists in The Bahamas 
travel by air or sea to the Family 
Islands. Most of the travelling 
occurs during holidays and 
regatta/homecomings. 
 
An international tourist is a person 
who travels outside their county to 
another country.  This usually 
requires travel documents such as 
passports and/or visas. They travel 
by airlines and cruise ships. Those 
who travel by air from far 
distances usually stay longer and 
spend more money than those who 
travel by cruise ships.

Some properties shut down and 
tourists are advised to return 
home. This can result in loss of 
revenue for these properties.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas. Mary Ingraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 


 
xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirations and feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

During the 70s the game declined, 
Because teachers did not know the game. 
They taught track and field and other sports, 
Which buried the cricket name.

RATIONALE 
 
Throughout our ever-changing world, there is a basic longing for human beings to connect with the spiritual side of their existence.  Even very young children 
express a natural curiosity about their existence and purpose. This curiosity leads to a search to find answers to fundamental questions such as:  Why am I here?  
Why do people suffer? What happens after death?  Religion serves the purpose of connecting human beings with their Creator, enabling them to explore answers 
to some of life’s mysteries.  
 
Religious Studies affords learners opportunities to explore religious beliefs and practices and how they impact individuals and the society.  It enables them to 
consider and respond to fundamental questions about their purpose in life.  It promotes the development of values and morals, enabling students to make informed 
decisions on moral and ethical issues.  Moreover, Religious Studies provides opportunities for students to demonstrate respect for other people, their opinions and 
beliefs. 
 
The aim of Religious Studies, therefore, is to help students develop skills for lifelong learning, enabling them to become productive citizens and stewards of the 
Earth. The Christian beliefs and values that are esteemed in this society will be transmitted to our students, providing them with a foundation on which they can 
develop good character, strengthen social relationships and build strong communities.  Ultimately, students will be equipped with the necessary skills, values and 
attitudes for life and work in the 21st century. 
 
The Religious Studies Curriculum supports the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (2015-2030) which promote equality for all, protection of our 
natural resources and peaceful societies.

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies should be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.

God is a Sustainer. A 
sustainer is someone who 
upholds, 
maintains 
or 
supports. God is a sustainer 
because He provides all the 
things creation needs to 
survive.  In His teachings, 
Jesus reminds us to not 
worry about food, clothing or 
shelter for God knows that 
we need them (Matt. 6:25-
32). God takes care of the 
animals and the plants. He 
sustains 
His 
creation 
through systems in nature 
like the water cycle and food 
chain.  The Bible also tells us 
that 
God 
protects 
His 
creation (Psalm 91:11).

Jesus said to baptize disciples 
in the name of the Father, Son 
and Holy Spirit.

2.2.B.5.1. Distinguish 
between the various 
types of prayer 
Prayer is important to the Christian faith.  
Three types of prayers are petition, 
intercession and thanksgiving.  A prayer of 
petition is asking God to do something for 
ourselves or for others (Living Prayers, 
2013). Intercessory prayer is a prayer of 
petition for other people. A prayer of 
thanksgiving expresses thanks to God for 
His goodness and blessings without making 
a request of God.

Holy Communion was first observed by

meal. Jesus washed His disciple’s feet 
(John 
13:4-9) 
and 
served 
them 
unleavened bread and wine (Mat. 26:26-
30). 
Jesus 
said 
that 
the 
bread 
represented His body and the wine His 
blood, shed for the forgiveness of sins.  
Holy Communion is served faithfully in 
Christian churches because of Jesus’ 
command (Luke 22:19).

Christening, infant dedication or 
baptism 
is 
another 
common 
Christian ritual.  A ritual is a 
solemn ceremony that follows a 
set format.  During an infant’s 
dedication, the baby, parents and 
godparents are present. These 
individuals stand before a minister 
of God. Then the child is prayed 
for and dedicated to the Lord.  In 
some churches, the baby is 
anointed with water. As an infant 
Jesus was presented to the priest 
Simeon for a blessing (Luke 2: 22-
38).  This was a common Jewish 
practice.

2.3. A.5.3. Promote the 
need to care for animals 
and plants in the 
environment 
As stewards of the Earth, we 
should promote its conservation 
and preservation.  Conservation 
is the wise use and careful 
management 
of 
the 
Earth’s 
resources.  This means practising 
the Three R’s: reduce, reuse and 
recycle.  Preservation is the 
protection of an area. We should 
encourage others to care for the 
Earth.  We can donate funds to 
support national parks like The 
Union Creek Reserve on Great 
Inagua, which helps with the 
preservation of native plants and 
animals.

2.3. C.5.1. Examine 
the importance of 
caring for one’s total 
being 
It is important to care for our total being: 
our physical, mental, emotional and 
spiritual selves. Our total being is needed 
to effectively perform daily activities. An 
unhealthy body makes it difficult to carry 
out simple tasks. A healthy mind (the part 
of our body that thinks) and spirit (the part 
of you that connects to God) are needed 
to make good choices and prevent stress, 
anxiety and depression.

concept of moderation 
as it relates to

One way to care for your total being is to 
do all things in moderation.  Moderation is 
not overdoing something. Over-doing 
certain activities like playing video games, 
eating or spending too much time online 
can affect your physical, mental and 
spiritual health. Exercise self-control by 
setting limits to avoid overdoing certain 
things.  You must balance your time.

The Bible expresses many 
truths about the benefits of 
having children.  Psalm 127:3 
states that children are a “gift” 
or “blessing” from the Lord.  
A woman rejoices when she 
has children because the 
shame 
is 
gone 
(Psalm 
113:9). Children bring joy to 
the home.  They also help to 
“bring parents closer to God 
and develop their Christian 
character.” 
  
Children, in the Bible days, 
assisted their parents by 
working (Gen. 4:2).  Today, 
children do chores at home 
and later find jobs.

The Early Church was a closely 
connected group of believers.  
According to the book of Acts, 
they met regularly in homes, ate 
meals together, prayed and 
learned about being Jesus’ 
disciples.  The miracles and 
teachings 
of 
the 
apostles 
caused many people to join the 
Church.  They were persecuted 
by the religious leaders. 
  
Today, Christian churches meet 
in 
small/large 
buildings 
for 
worship and fellowship.  At 
times, the members fellowship 
in homes and church halls.  
Some Christians around the 
world are persecuted for their

There are many Bahamian 
traditions that have influenced 
our behaviour.  Such traditions 
include 
storytelling, 
being 
good neighbours and going to 
church.  Storytelling is an 
excellent way to teach values 
and 
build 
character.  
Bahamians 
have 
always 
practised 
being 
good 
neighbours based on biblical 
teachings (Leviticus 19:18 and 
Luke 10:25-37). Going to 
church 
is 
a 
tradition 
all 
Bahamians value.  They learn 
Christian principles that they 
can use daily.

Sequencing   
(Organization)  
Details are placed in a logical order and 
the way they are presented effectively 
keeps the interest of the reader.  
Details are placed in a logical order, but 
the way they are presented sometimes 
makes the writing less interesting.  
Some details are not in a logical or 
expected order, and this distracts the 
reader.  
Many details are not in a logical or expected 
order. There is little sense that the writing is 
organized.  
  
Flow & Rhythm  
(sentence fluency)  
All sentences sound natural and are 
easy-on-the-ear when read aloud. Each 
sentence is clear and has an obvious 
emphasis.  
Almost all sentences sound natural and 
are easy-on-the-ear when read aloud, 
but 1 or 2 are awkward or difficult to 
understand.  
Most sentences sound natural and are 
easy-on-the-ear when read aloud, but 
several are awkward or difficult to 
understand.  
The sentences are difficult to read along 
because they sound awkward, are 
distractingly repetitive, or difficult to 
understand.  
  
Word choice  
Writer uses vivid words and phrases 
that linger or draw pictures in the 
reader’s mind, and the choice and 
placement of the words seems 
accurate, natural, and not forced.  
Writer uses vivid words and phrases 
that linger or draw pictures in the 
reader’s mind, but occasionally the 
words are used inaccurately or seem 
overdone.  
Writer uses words that communicate 
clearly, but the writing lacks variety, punch, 
or flair.  
Writer uses a limited vocabulary, which does 
not communicate strongly or capture the 
reader’s interest. Jargon or clichés may be 
present and detract from the meaning.

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that 
will equip them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by 
Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They 
are respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as 
that state of well-being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of 
all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human 
development. This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration 
with Government Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will 
include sensitization and training for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit 
will coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, 
substance abuse prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage 
pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be 
conducted to address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles 
through training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
Technology is the application of tools and methods of 
applying technical knowledge.  
 
Technology has always impacted human life, but today’s 
children live in a world in which technology is changing very 
quickly and affecting so many areas of their lives e.g.   
Education: computers, internet, TV, radio, video, CD and 
DVD players, etc 
Communication: cell phones, telephones, computers, text 
messages, iPods, etc.  
Entertainment: TV, radio, video, CD and DVD players, etc. 
Family Living: appliances, equipment, automobiles, etc.      
 
While no technology is good or bad in and of itself, every 
new technology poses moral choices. How technology is 
used can have a positive or negative effect on one’s 
development.  
 
Level 1: Compile a list of new 
technologies they have experienced in 
their life time.  
 
Level 2: Define technology and list forms 
of technology today.

EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
Children need to make healthy decisions about whether to use these 
technologies in ways that will help them grow and develop into 
healthy, productive citizens  
 
Guidelines for Safe Use of Technology:  
- Balance the time spent in using technology with wholesome 
activities e.g. reading, gardening, sports, etc.   
- Exercise common sense to evaluate products advertized in the 
internet   
- Avoid talking to people who they don’t know in chat rooms or on 
the internet 
- Use the internet for constructive purposes instead of surfing the net  
 - Exercise precaution when viewing various technology devices e.g. 
imitating what athletes and super stars in magazines and on TV do. 
These actions can result in unhealthy behaviours and can harm the 
body.

All human beings grow and develop in a given sequence 
but at different rates.  
 
Puberty is the period during adolescence when the body 
begins to develop and change.  Puberty usually starts 
between ages 8 and 13 in girls and 10 and 15 in boys.  
Everyone begins puberty at his or her own pace.  
 
During puberty, male and female hormones are released 
into the blood stream. Hormones are chemicals that 
cause body growth and physical, emotional and mental 
changes. 
 
Physical Changes and Development:   
Physical changes during puberty affect the way the body 
looks. These changes can be dramatic and disturbing   
- Oily skin/acne 
- Sudden growth  
- Sometimes clumsy   
- Increased perspiration and body odor  
Level 1:  List the changes that occur in 
boys and girls during puberty.  
 
Level 2: (a) Label where changes occur 
on male and female diagrams. (b) Create 
a personal checklist of the changes 
expected to occur as a result of puberty. 
 
Level 3: (a) Create a Venn diagram that 
records the changes experienced by 
boys, by girls and by both. (b) Discuss 
why puberty begins at different times 
for each person.

HIV is a virus which stands for (Human Immune-
deficiency Virus). When this virus attacks the immune 
system, it makes it weak and unable to protect against 
infections and diseases.  
 
HIV is different from most of the other communicable 
diseases because it is a STI and requires contact with 
body fluids such as blood, saliva, urine, etc. It has no 
cure, or vaccine to prevent it.  
 
Transmission of HIV: 
HIV is carried by body fluids such as blood, semen, 
vaginal fluids and breast milk of an infected person. It 
is generally passed on through:   
- Unprotected sexual intercourse;  
- Blood transfusion / Sharing needles; 
- An infected woman to her baby during birth, or 
through breast-feeding   
Level 1: Define terms related to 
HIV and AIDS.  
 
Level 2:  Identify ways in which 
HIV can be (a) transmitted (b) not

Non-transmission of HIV:   
The HIV virus does not pass through the air. You can 
not get it from being in the same room with an infected 
person.  
You can not get it by touching or hugging, sharing 
pencils or hairbrushes or even food.   
The HIV virus causes AIDS which stands for Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  People with AIDS die 
from other diseases they get such as pneumonia and 
cancer. 
 
Prevention of HIV and AIDS:  
Make choices that keep you healthy  
- Abstain from sex until you are an adult or married  
- Never use drugs. They impair your judgment  
- Have one faithful sexual partner

choices e.g. poor eating or drinking habits, lack of exercise, drug 
use, etc.  
 
Persons who are overweight or obese (very fat) are at higher risk 
or more likely to develop life style diseases.   
 
Life style diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension 
(high blood pressure), cancer and AIDS are the leading causes of 
death in The Bahamas.  
 
These diseases can be prevented with  better life style choices: 
- Practice healthy eating by making healthy food choices 
- Exercise  regularly  
- Get enough sleep every night  
- Avoid using drugs such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, etc.

TEACHING AND  
EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
Any natural event that causes widespread injury, death and property 
damage is known as a natural disaster e.g. hurricane, storm, tornado, 
flood, earthquake, and Tsunami.   
 
Every year hurricanes, storms, tornadoes and floods occur in The 
Bahamas. Knowing what to do during these natural disasters could 
mean the difference between life and death.  
 
A hurricane is a storm that forms over tropical areas of oceans and can 
move inland. In a hurricane, rain is heavy, and winds blow greater than 
75 miles per hour. 
 
A tropical storm also forms over tropical areas of oceans. Wind speeds 
vary between 40 and 75 miles per hour.  
 
A tornado is a violently rotating funnel-shaped column of air associated 
with a thunder storm. Signs such as dark greenish sky, large hail and a 
loud roar occur. Tornadoes can form quickly without warning.  
  
Hurricanes and thunder storms can cause major flooding especially in 
low-lying areas.  
Level 1: Identify the natural 
disasters that occur on their island.  
 
Level 2: Describe natural disasters 
and their effects on families and 
communities.   
 
Level 3: Identify agencies that 
respond to natural disasters.

TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices; and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, 
values and attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. 
However, teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit 
grades which will contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. 
(sharing thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills) 
• Field trips 
• Internships 
• Community Services 
 
Assessment Procedures 
 
Students are assessed based on the following: 
 
Class work and Homework   
60% 
 
Projects and Portfolios  
 
40%

Health and Family Life Education Resource / Information Centre 
 
Each classroom should have a resource or information centre in which information on health issues and students’ work are displayed. Health 
and Family Life materials and activities can also be incorporated into the learning centres in primary schools. 
 
Listed are some suggested resources that will make Health and Family Life Education classes more interactive and interesting: 
 
• Computer Software 
• Transparencies on health issues   
• Games and Puzzles  
• Reality dolls 
• Puppets 
• Posters / Charts 
• Videos, DVDs and Audio Cassette tapes on health issues 
• Pamphlets  
• Brochures  
• Guest Speakers  
• Media sources  
 
Health and Family Life Education Services 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit provides the following services in New Providence and the Family Islands. 
 
• Workshop and sensitization sessions for teachers, parents, students and the public 
• Resources on health issues 
• Peer leadership training 
• HIV Prevention and Basic First Aid training  
 
Partnerships 
 
The Health and Family Education Unit collaborates with parents, school personnel, Government and Non-Government organizations to provide 
wholesome programmes for students. These activities are designed to help them gain the required knowledge, skills, values and attitudes so that 
they will graduate from the education system as fully functioning, self-confident, responsible individuals.

APPENDIX III 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will 
be time for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, 
role play, games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication,

TEACHING GOOD VALUES AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP 
 
 
Dr. Marian Bock, Director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle’s Virtues Project defines virtues as universal positive character traits. She 
defines values as agreements, rules, principles, codes and beliefs about how to practice these virtues. Bock recommends integrating fifty-two 
universal virtues into appropriate family life classes by encouraging students to recognize them in themselves and others.

address the needs of students 
and to empower them with 
skills and attitudes required 
for personal development 
and for active participation in 
society. 
 
The rationale to implement

was based on the high rate of 
teenage pregnancy along 
with other related social 
problems in the society.  
 
The curriculum was 
Designed to address issues 
and as well as promote 
values and appropriate 
behaviours. 
 
The rationale for

and to address the limited 
learning about health 
issues such as sexuality, 
eating and fitness and 
interpersonal relationships. 
 
The curriculum was 
designed to prepare 
children and young people 
for the challenges of 
adolescence and adulthood. 
 
It also provided awareness 
among children and young 
people about the 
relationship between their 
health and the choices they 
make in everyday life. 
 
The Personal and Social 
Curriculum focused on 
developing the personality 
in its entire dimension: 
physically, intellectual and 
emotional. 
 
The curriculum was 
designed to address the 
following: 
 
Students’ knowledge, 
understanding and 
skills. 
Risks factors and re-
emerging diseases and 
the emergence of 
relatively new diseases.

Philosophy / Rationale 
(Explains why there is a curriculum.  It 
is the component to be worked on. All 
teams work jointly. Be clear and 
concise.) 
The curriculum will be based a thematic approach with emphasis on life skills and character 
development. It  will address the social issues and risk behaviours of children and adolescents in the 
Bahamian Education system e.g. violence, HIV, AIDS, STIs, child abuse, obesity, teenage 
pregnancy, low self-esteem, and gang culture. Age appropriate topics will be developed for various 
grade levels. 
Goals and Objectives 
(Provides communicative objectives, 
content, suggested activities, assessment 
and resources) 
The curriculum will contain an over-arching goal.  The sub-goals (standards) and objectives 
(benchmarks) will be related to the over-arching goal. 
Scope and Sequence 
Provides an overview of what is to be 
taught and learnt at each level of the 
student’s development 
A Scope of Sequence Chart will be included for grades 1-6, which will be based on the four major 
themes in the CARICOM HFLE Framework: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, Sexuality and 
Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. 
Scope of Work 
Provides communicative objectives, 
content, suggested activities, assessment 
and resources 
The curriculum will progress from components based to a thematic approach and will  incorporate 
the following areas: 
-Issues in schools and society 
-Curriculum connections with Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies, 
-Character development, life skills and values 
-Literacy development e.g. reading/writing activities 
-Technology  
-Gender equality 
Design / Format 
The curriculum will continue to use the landscaped format (81/2 x 11) which is easier to manipulate 
and is reader-friendly. Objectives will be clearly matched with the overarching goal and sub-goal. A 
glossary of terms will be included in the document, as well as a variety of resources for both 
teachers and students. 
The curriculum will be available on the internet with live links. CD and hard copies will also be

PREFACE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This curriculum has been developed to assist in the dissemination of Physical Education activities and techniques.  It is hoped that this curriculum will assist all 
practitioners of the subject, especially our colleagues in the Family Islands, to improve their delivery of the subject.  It has been said that “the greatest gift that can be given, 
is the gift of knowledge” (author unknown). 
 
It is the hope of all of the professionals who assisted in the compilation of this work, that it will be a source of inspiration and a valuable tool in the tool-box of knowledge 
and instruction to all Physical Education instructors.

RATIONALE 
 
Physical Education is the nucleus of healthy lifestyles and caters significantly to the physically educated citizens. 
It is through this medium that an invaluable learning experience unfolds, allowing all learners to access the knowledge, skills and attitudes that shape their lives through 
this active learning process. 
 
This process of learning embraces the values placed on life and secures each individual in his personal experiences, as these experiences coincide with the stream of things, 
both cognitive and physical in every pursuit. 
 
We must continue to be cognizant of the fact that the needs and experiences of our youth must not be ignored in our planning, for it is through their experiences and 
enjoyment of movement that they will find Physical Education enjoyable.  Regular physical activity is pertinent to the development of the “whole man “.  For children, it is 
through this kind of physical activity and movements that they zoom in on their lives as a whole, critical to all aspects of their development, including the psychomotor, 
cognitive and affective domains.  Therefore, the well-being of individuals depends greatly on the soundness of the Physical Education programme. 
 
In the structured Physical Education programme, consideration must be given to the level of safety of the learners, so as to provide a nurturing environment that would 
enable the development of functional levels of activity, including specific motor skills and functional physical fitness.  The learners Physical Education experiences and 
development must be geared towards appropriate values, personal and social behaviors. 
 
In summary, each individual learner should be progressively assessed in order that their needs are met, providing the opportunity for all to partake in these unique 
experiences equally. 
 
It must therefore be observed, that Physical Education should not be confused with the activities of private sports clubs, sports organizations, or inter-school athletic 
competitions, because these function only to complement this process.  Physical Education is a structured well-balance programme which provides the physically educated 
persons with exciting experience from the knowledge of its nature, skills and developed positive attitudes from its practice; engendering daily routines and leisure pursuits 
through life. 
 
A well-structured and vibrant physical education programme is essential in our Nation as we are in pursuit of excellence.  This active learning will foster personal growth of 
the individual through Physical Education, therefore enhancing the skills necessary to meet the challenges of an ever-changing society. 
 
Thus, an investment in the Physical Education of our children is an investment in the long-term health and prosperity of our Bahama land for years to come.

PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
 
The new direction of Physical Education at Primary level is to provide all students with a safe, enjoyable and nurturing environment where physical activity and the 
development of motor skills will be enhanced.  Each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her potential through the acquisition of knowledge, and skills 
that will transfer to a healthy lifestyle and lifelong sports.  The base of the Physical Programme is Body Management Competence, which gives focus to the development of 
fundamental skills that lead into specialized skills training.  Primary students will also participate in the core sports such as Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, Soccer 
and Track and Field.   Interschool competitions take place in all of the “core sports” aforementioned including, Mini- tennis.  It is the responsibility of the New Providence 
Primary School Sports Association in collaboration with the Department of Education and the various Sports Factions to organize and conduct the competitions, 
reinforcing the principles of fair play, sportsmanship and self-control.

CONTENT STANDARDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
1. Demonstrates competency and proficiency in movement forms. 
The intent of this standard is to develop competence and proficiency in movement.  In preparation for adulthood, students should have acquired the basic skills to 
participate in a wide variety of leisure and work- related physical activities and advance in at least two or three areas. 
 
2. Apply movement concept and principles to learning and development of motor skills. 
This standard concerns the ability of the learner to use cognitive information to understand and enhance motor skills.  By graduation the student should have developed 
sufficient knowledge and ability to independently use their learned behavior to acquire new skills while continuing to refine existing ones. 
 
3. Exhibits physically active lifestyles. 
The intent of this standard is to establish patterns of regular participation in meaningful physical activity.  This standard should connect what was done in physical 
education classes with the lives of students outside of class. 
4. Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 
This standard is for the student to achieve a health-enhancing level of physical fitness.  Student should be encouraged to develop higher levels of basic fitness and 
physical competence as needed for many work situations and active leisure participation.  Students should have both the ability and the willingness to accept 
responsibility for personal fitness leading to an active, healthy lifestyle. 
 
5. Demonstrates responsible personal and social behaviors in physical activity settings. 
Achievement of this standard includes safe practices, adherence to rules and procedure, etiquette, cooperation and teamwork, and positive social interaction. 
 
6. Show respect for differences among people in physical activity settings. 
The intent of this standard is to develop respect for individual similarities and differences through positive interaction among participants in physical activity.  
Similarities and differences include characteristics of culture, ethnicity, motor performance, disabilities, physical characteristics (strength, size, and shape), gender, race 
and socioeconomic status.  
 
7. Recognize that physical activity opportunities are for enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. 
As a result of these intrinsic benefits of participation, students will begin to actively pursue lifelong physical activities that meet their own needs.

What does it means to be 
Physically Fit? 
 
Body composition is an 
important part of fitness. 
 
-You can get fat from not 
exercising, being inactive, 
eating too much or not eating 
correctly.  
 
It is important to have good 
posture  
  
-Good posture helps your bones 
and body to grow tall and 
strong. 
 
Your heart is an important 
muscle  
-Exercise makes your heart beat 
faster   
 
-Exercise causes your heart to 
take in more oxygen from the 
lungs 
 
-Your heart rate tells you how 
hard your heart is working, and 
how fit you are. 
Muscles are an important part 
of the body 
 
- Muscles help you move, hold 
your body up and protect bones 
 
Discuss what it means to be 
physically fit.

By the end of  grades  5  - 
6,  students will be able to: 
 
-Recap from grades 3 and 
4 
 -      Demonstrate concern 
for the care and safety of 
others and for equipment. 
 -      Demonstrate basic 
gymnastic skills in a 
simple routine on floor 
and apparatus. 
- 
Create patterns and 
combinations of 
movements into 
repeatable sequences. 
- 
Demonstrate balance 
and control on a

body actions to move 
into and out of a 
variety of transfers of 
weight from feet to 
hands with large 
extensions e.g. 
stretching legs wide; 
torso twisting; rolling; 
curving feet over to 
Recap from grades 3 and 4 
 
1.  TRANSFER OF WEIGHT 
a.    Rocking from one body part to  
       another. 
b.    Rolling from one body part to  
       another 
c.     Feet to hands – head up when  
        moving onto equipment, arms     
        take weight first. 
d.    Spring takeoffs (Flight) – Jump    
       from one foot to two feet; push    
       off the balls of the feet, soft   
       landings. 
 
ii. BALANCING 
a.  Base of support- the higher your  
     center of gravity from the ground  
     or equipment the more difficult it  
     is to balance. It is harder to balance  
    when  your bases of support are far    
    away  from or outside your center      
    of 
gravity. 
Counter-balance 
involves  
     a wide base of support and pushing  
    against each other. Counter-tension  
    involves a narrow base of support  
    and pulling away from each other. 
b. Static- tight muscles keep the center 
of gravity over base of support. 
c.  Dynamic- keep the center of gravity  
 
1. Provide opportunities for students 
to explore different movements on 
the mats individually and in groups. 
 
2. Use stations and task cards to 
help students create routines. 
 
3. Have students review a DVD or 
videotaped performance of a 
gymnast. Watch it once without 
stopping, then rewind and stop at 
various points to initiate discussion. 
Emphasize techniques performed in 
class. 
 
4. Have students balance in pairs, 
using given examples of counter 
balance and counter tension. Ask if 
they can move while pushing or 
pulling against each other. Then ask 
them to try in groups of three or 
four. E.g. 1. Sitting back to back 
with elbows joined, stand up and sit 
down without moving the feet.  
 
5. Have students face their partner, 
palms against each other at shoulder 
level, inch the feet away from the 
center. How far can they get 
without falling?

6. GOLDEN NUGGET #1: 
During an obstacle 
course/circuit work the 
teacher will place a long 
jump mat with numbers on 
them . This will be use as 
station for jumping skills by 
practicing a forward and 
backward jump for distance. 
The teacher will explain 
that the jumping/landing 
skill is inherent to proper 
body control and that the 
backward jump task is the 
first step in teaching a back-
hand spring. This 
propulsion in a backward 
plane is an important part of 
the skill. Landing is a vital 
part – If a student is off 
balance in a backward 
motion, it will give the 
student an opportunity to 
learn how to fall properly 
and incorporate another 
lead up skill (back roll , egg 
roll, shoulder roll ) all skills

SKILL TEST 
GRADES 5 & 6   
STRAND: GYMNASTICS 
 
 1. One Hand -Cartwheel -    Students are expected to keep their legs fully astride throughout this movement and do not allow their body to lean  
                      forward at the start or finish of the exercise. The student should perform a cartwheel in a straight line, on the floor, and on  
                      a bench or low beam using one hand. The students should be able to do 5 consecutive Cartwheels.  
  
 2. Forward Roll -  Students should demonstrate the proper way to tuck their head down while pushing in a forward motion with their legs. They  
                     should be sure to keep some weight supported with their arms. Students should recover by standing up without pushing on     
                            the floor with their hands. The students should be able to do 5 consecutive rolls.  
 3.  Backward Roll – Students are expected to place their hands flat on the floor with fingers towards their shoulders as they roll back to a stand  
                       doing backwards rolls consecutively down an incline mat. The students should be able to do 5 consecutive rolls.  
  
 4.  Handstand – This skill can be reached with students standing as tall as possible. The student should be stretching upwards towards the  
                      ceiling and staying hollow. Students should walk around on your hands whenever possible for 5 to 10 seconds. 
 5. Handstand to Forward Roll - This skill can be reached with students transferring their body from a handstand into a forward roll. Students  
                        should hold the handstand for 5 to 10 seconds before transferring into the forward roll.  
  
 6. Back extension – Students will perform back extensions by standing and transferring weight by reaching for the ground, watching their  
                     toes the entire time and keeping their head in and body hollow. The student should kick the legs up just short of handstand  
                     and roll forward, to a crouch position. Students should be able to do 5 back extensions.

up and out. 
b. Make a lay-up in the basket using 
either hand. 
4.  PIVOTING 
 
a. A player cannot move once he receives 
the basketball.  However, he can pivot on 
one foot, right or left.  That foot must 
remain in contact with the ground at all 
times until the player decides to dribble 
or pass the ball off.

dribbling and passing to keep the 
ball away from defenders. Allow 
the players to make up their own 
rules. When it is appropriate, 
discuss the offensive and 
defensive strategies of creating 
and denying space, and why these 
are important.

LONG JUMP 
- 
The key to an effective successful jump is how high 
the jumper can raised his or her center of gravity. 
- 
Long Jump is performed on a Long Jump runway, 
which is normally 40 meters in length and 1.25 
meters in width. 
- 
The jumper’s landing area is called a “Pit” which is 
located at the end of the Long Jump runway.  It is 
usually 3 meters wide and filled with soft damped 
sand. 
- 
The “Pit” with the take-off board should be level 
plain 
- 
There are two types of Long Jump techniques used 
in elementary schools.  These  are: 
(c ) Standing Long Jump 
(d)  Running Long Jump 
 
STANDING LONG JUMP 
- 
This type of jump is made with both feet. 
- 
The arms are brought back and driven in an upward 
vigorous thrust in order    to propel the body upward 
and forward. 
 
RUNNING LONG JUMP 
- 
A  short run is needed

102
The jumper approaches the high-jump bed at a 
35 to 40 degree angle. 
 
The jumper must lower his center of gravity 
and lengthen his strides during his last step on 
approaching the high jump bed. 
 
 
TAKE-OFF 
The take-off  foot should be ahead  of  the 
jumper’s center of  gravity 
 
The take-off foot lands heel first  
 
Both arms are pulled back. 
 
The free leg is unbend and swings vigorously 
upward before the take-off foot loses contact 
with the ground. 
 
FOSBURY  FLOP 
Run-Up 
The jumper approaches the high jump bed in a 
curved manner. 
 
The last three to four strides are shorter than 
in a straddle jump. 
 
The feet follow a path more parallel to the 
cross bar. 
 
TAKE-OFF 
The take-off leg is less flexed and is planted 
almost parallel to the crossbar.

PRACTICAL VOLLEYBALL SKILL TEST 
 
 
Parallel line is drawn through the middle of the court.  Each half is further subdivided into three equal areas by lines drawn parallel to the sidelines.  This gives six areas 
numbered 1 - 6 and which compares to the playing stations.  Each student is allowed one attempt to serve the ball into each of the six areas in turn.  Two points are awarded 
for serving into the designated court area.  One point is given for missing the designated area. 
 
 
Bumping 
 
 
 
- 
Keep it up, Repetitious hitting 
 
 
Bumping for accuracy passing  
- 
To a setter or hitting a prescribed target.  
 
 
Court layout for service testing 
 
 
Wall volleying – Player stands behind a line four (4) feet away from a wall.  A line representing the height of the net is drawn on the wall about six and half feet (6.5) up.  
Players are asked to make as many volleys as they can in one (1) minute.  If a student steps over the line in a volley, or if the ball goes lower than the mark on the wall, that 
volley does not count.  This test can be administered for the underhand pass (bump) and the overhead pass (flick). 
 
 
Simplified serving-- Students stand in the normal serving position behind the line on any side of the court.  The score is the number of successful serves out of ten trials.  
Each serve that clears the net counts as one.  
 
 
Underhand and Overhead Services 
 
- 
Serving to a spot on the court to demonstrate accuracy. 
- 
Children demonstrate correct techniques in both forms of serving 
Emphasis on: 
- 
Body Positioning 
- 
Proper contact with the ball 


 
116
- 
Proper arm motion 
Overhead pass 
viii. 
Children demonstrate correct body positioning and striking technique to correctly perform an overhead pass.  They pass the ball to one another in small 
groups. 
 
The Bump 
ix. 
Children bump the ball from different positions demonstrating proper techniques. 
x. 
Bent knees, straight arms with contact point between elbows and wrist. 
xi. 
Keeping the ball up using the bump for a number of continuous hits; bumping a tossed ball.  Number of attempts 5 - 10 
 
Setting 
-     Children demonstrate proper setting techniques.  They are divided in sets of threes: one receiver, a setter and a spiker.  Each child gets a chance at all three positions. 
 
Rules of the game 
xii. 
Children demonstrate that they understand court positioning by placing number cards in correct positions on the courts. 
xiii. 
They respond to questions on court size, heights of net, number of players, points, line violations.

- 
Become familiar with 
wicket keeping skills. 
 
 
- 
Run between the wickets. 
Throwing: 
Use the arm as a guide as you throw the ball 
over the right shoulder towards a fielder, 
wicket keeper and the stumps.  Opposite 
action for left hander. 
Step with foot opposite to the throwing hand.  
Throw the ball waist height to the receiver. 
 
Catching    
Observe the ball from above the head into the 
cupped shaped hands close the hands on 
contact and pull it towards the body. 
 
Bowling 
Step forward with opposite foot and hand as 
you bring the ball from waist level with a 
straight hand and release just above the 
shoulder level.  
Bowl to hit the stumps. 
Fielding 
When fielding a rolling ball kneel with one 
knee on the ground and the other at right 
angle to help block the ball.  Hands are 
cupped together in contact with the ground to 
get the ball effectively. 
When running to field the ball, if one cannot 
get to the proper fielding position, use the 
foot to stop the ball from reaching the 
boundary for extra runs.  Never step over the 
boundary when catching a ball or the 
opposing team will get the extra runs. 
 
- 
Children run designated distances 
from box to box known as a safe zone.  
First on command and secondly to 
avoid being tagged with a soft sponge 
ball e.g. Children are divided into two 
teams.  The first team is divided into 
the two boxes.  The second team is 
scattered around the designated play 
area.  The team in one of the boxes 
throws the ball anywhere into the play 
area; the children must run from one 
box to the other without being tagged 
with the ball.

effectively. 
 
 
 
- 
Score the game of cricket. 
 
 
- 
Know the boundaries 
 
 
- 
Understand the ways to 
get outs during play. 
 
Batting 
Stand with feet shoulder width apart gripping 
the handle of the bat.  If you can’t swing the 
bats, block the ball with the bat. 
Always wear protective mitts, leg pads, cups 
and if necessary a helmet to prevent injuries 
while batting. 
 
Running between the wickets 
 
As a batter hits the ball and it appears that a 
run can be made, he runs to the opposite end 
sliding his bat into the cease, as does his 
partner.  After hitting the ball the batter must 
keep the bat in his hand while running 
between the wickets, the bat must be 
grounded as he reaches the crease at the 
opposite end until the foot reaches the crease 
 
Wicket Keeping 
The wicket keeper must always wear 
appropriate pads and gloves  to prevent the 
balls not hit by the batters  passing him to go 
for runs. 
Catches all balls he can get to within his 
range. 
Stumps the batter out should he be out the 
crease as he receives the ball in the rear of the 
stumps. 
 
Scoring 
A run is scored when both batters cross over 
and reach the opposite crease before a fielded 
ball is thrown and hits the stumps.  You may 
score more than one run when running.  This 
depends upon the amount of times the batters 
cross over and reach their crease successfully.

Should a ball be hit and rolls along the 
ground to the boundary before being fielded 
or even if it comes in contact with the fielder 
and rolls there, this is scored as four runs and 
there is no need to run. 
Should a ball be hit and makes no contact 
with the ground before going in the back 
boundary, it is scored six runs. 
 
Extra runs: 
 
If a bowler’s front foot lands in front of the 
crease as he delivers a ball, it is called a “no” 
ball and scored as one, four or six as hit by 
the batter. 
Should a bowler deliver a ball out of the 
batter’s range, it is called a wide ball and can 
be scored as one run or four runs should it 
reach the boundary. 
 
Byes 
If a ball is bowled, the batter makes a play, 
misses it and it passes the wicket keeper, the 
batter can run for as many runs as possible; 
should it not hit the boundary, it can only be 
scored as four runs. 
 
Leg Byes 
Should the ball hit the batter’s pad while he 
attempts to hit it, he and his partner may run 
as many runs as possible, providing it does 
not hit the boundary to be scored as four 
runs. 
 
Placing the ball when batting, the batter has 
the option to hit the ball in any direction.  He

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them with the 
necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an independent, ever-changing world. 
Visual Arts Unit 
Vision 
We envision an art education programme in which all students in The Bahamas are guided toward literacy, an appreciation of Artists, craft persons, and Bahamian 
culture. We also envision an art education programme that is comprehensive and will nurture the spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, creative, imaginative, aesthetic, 
social and physical wellbeing of the child. 
Mission Statement 
Our mission is to advance art education through appropriate curriculum, teacher development programmes, stimulating environments, the provision of materials and 
relevant information. By doing so, we provide students with learning experiences that focus on their creative development, aesthetic appreciation, critical thinking and 
cultural awareness as well as inter-disciplinary integration. 
Belief Statement 
Art education is beneficial to all students regardless of social, ethnic, economic or educational background. Art is an integral part of the overall educational development 
of the student as it compliments and unites other disciplines while promoting visual literacy skills, imaginative thinking and visual communication. 
We further believe that: 
• Art education provides students with the means to think critically, experience, and understand the world around them in unique ways. 
• Art enables students to become self-directed and lifelong learners. 
• Art provides learning opportunities of varying abilities. 
• Art education enhances the ability to interact in society by developing creative problem solving, inquiry, and communication skills, and by providing an avenue 
for self-expression and multiple points of view. 
• Students develop attitudes of appreciation, self-worth, joy in the creation of artworks, and in viewing the works of other students and artists.

• Art is a way to appreciate the beauty and value of the environment and the preservation of our heritage. 
• Art provides opportunities to exhibit in classrooms, schools, art centres and museums, sharing the art curriculum with the community, teachers, students, and 
examiners. 
• Art education increases awareness of career possibilities, promotes entrepreneurial skills and highlights our community’s visual resources. 
• Art education reflects and influences the cultural, social, political and economic aspirations and concerns of our society. 
• Art is a way to appreciate differences and promotes cultural, social and ethnic similarities.

Assessment 
Lines 
• Recognize that 
various kinds of 
lines enable an 
artist to express 
ideas. 
• Distinguish between 
an outline, a contour 
and a gesture 
• Examine and use 
contour drawing 
and perspective 
drawing techniques 
to create art. 
• Create gesture and 
contour 
observational 
drawings. 
• Use one-point 
perspective to 
create the illusion of 
space. 
Outline 
 An outline is the line or group of lines 
that define a shape or figure. 
Contour Lines 
Contour lines describe the shape of an 
object and include interior detail. 
Gesture Lines 
Gesture lines are drawn quickly and 
are used to lay in the structure of a 
form. It describes movement and 
direction.  
When an artist wants to show 
distance and depth he or she uses a 
technique called Linear Perspective. 
For example, in a picture of a road, 
the artist would use parallel lines 
that seem to meet or come close 
together in the distance. 
• Discussions on Outlines and Contour Lines 
• Contour line drawings of natural and manmade 
objects.

Value 
• Produce work with a 
variety of tints and 
shades. 
• Use shading (value) 
to transform a two-
dimensional shape 
into a three-
dimensional form 
(e.g., circle to a 
sphere). 
• Use contrast (light 
and dark) 
expressively in an 
original work of art. 
• Experiment with 
creating varying 
degrees of colour 
intensity 
• Use various colours 
to show how 
Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a 
colour can be.  Add white to a colour 
to make it light and add black to a 
colour to make it dark. When black is 
added to a colour it creates a SHADE. 
When white is added to a colour you 
create a TINT. White is the lightest 
value; black is the darkest. Value is 
important to drawing and painting, 
value changes are what creates 
contrast. Contrast helps us 
understand 2-D artworks.  
Shading, Shadows and Highlights 
Shading is adding light and dark 
values to a drawing. To get darker 
values with a pencil you press harder, 
to get lighter values with a pencil you 
press softer. Black is the darkest 
value and white is the lightest value. 
• Make a value scale and apply it to an object 
• Draw and paint pictures showing different values

changes in light can 
create differences in 
shading 
There are three basic shading 
techniques, hatching, cross-hatching 
and stippling. 
Shadows are created when an object 
comes between the light and the 
surface. Shadows are always opposite 
the light. A highlight is an area where 
the light hits the object directly. 
Highlights are the lightest value. 
Pattern, Rhythm & 
Movement 
• Recognize patterns 
around them 
• Describe a pattern 
• Examine how artists 
use patterns as a 
form of expression 
• Experiment with 
lines, shapes and 
colours to produce 
patterns using a 
variety of media 
• Perceive and 
describe rhythm and 
movement in works 
of art and the 
environment. 
• Create a piece of art 
emphasizing rhythm 
and movement, 
Patterns  
Patterns can be found everywhere in 
our daily lives, on tree leaves and 
trunks, waves, butterfly wings, 
seashells and lots more. 
These are created by repeating lines, 
shapes and colours. The part 
that is repeated is called a 
motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art 
through repeating lines, shapes, 
colours, and more. Rhythm creates a 
mood like music or dancing. The best 
example of movement in art is Vincent 
van Gogh’s The Starry Night, which 
takes your eyes on a rollercoaster 
ride around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears.

cultures 
Visual rhythm is 66created by 
repeated positive shapes separated 
by negative spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your 
eye through the artwork. 
Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements 
in their artwork using the same size 
and length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples 
include flowers, clouds, or waves. 
Flowing rhythm is when organic 
shapes are repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, 
but we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes 
in a way that would lead the viewer’s 
eyes from one point to the next in

Texture  
Everything has some type of texture. 
The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough. 
Artists create texture in their artwork 
to show how objects might feel 
Tactile Texture can be touched and 
seen.  
Visual Texture is a texture that can be 
seen in a picture rather than felt.

The Renaissance  
The Renaissance was a cultural 
movement that began in Italy in the 
1300s. The Renaissance increased 
trade between European countries 
which led to increased wealth and 
power.  This increased wealth allowed 
merchants and businessmen to 
support artists. Scholars, 
philosophers, and artists turned to 
the works of the ancient Greeks and 
Romans for inspiration.  
During the Renaissance books were 
invented, Galileo experimented with 
astronomy, Christopher Columbus 
discovered the new world and Martin 
Luther broke away from the Catholic 
church to form the Lutheran. 
Renaissance artists made their 
paintings look realistic, they 
experimented with perspective. 
Artists now began to focus on 
paintings of humans and not Gods or 
biblical themes. Four famous 
Renaissance artists were Leonardo, 
Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello. 
Leonardo da Vinci 
“Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 
May 1519) was an Italian man who 
lived in the time of the Renaissance.

He is famous for his paintings, but he 
was also 
a scientist, mathematician, engineer, i
nventor, anatomist, sculptor, architec
t, botanist, musician, and writer. 
Leonardo wanted to know everything 
about nature. He wanted to know how 
everything worked. He was very good 
at studying, designing and making all 
sorts of interesting things.”KPedia 
Michelangelo Buonarroti 
“Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti 
Simoni (6 March 1475 – 18 February 
1564), known as Michelangelo, was 
an Italian Renaissance painter, sculpt
or, architect, poet, and engineer. 
Along with Leonardo da Vinci, he is 
often called a "Renaissance man" 
which means that he had great talent 
in many areas.” KPedia

object is situated; It can be created 
using colour, shapes and values. 
Positive  
This is the object being drawn like an 
apple or a car. 
Negative 
This is the space that is left empty. It

away from you. The objects here are 
very small and the colours are very 
dull. 
Middle Ground 
This is between the Background and

Observational Study 
• Emphasize spatial 
relationships, 
diminishing size, 
and detail in works 
of art 
• Identify that the 
shapes of objects 
change when the 
viewpoint changes 
• Record observations 
of natural, man-
made objects as well 
as the human face.  
 
Observational study 
Observational art is to draw or paint 
a subject as accurately as possible. 
The subject may be a still life, figure 
model, portrait or landscape and the 
image must be created from real life 
rather than a photograph or the 
artist's imagination. 
Draw what you see and not what you 
know. 
Natural and Man-Made Objects 
Fruits and vegetables, flowers, 
seashells, shoes, teapots, soda cans. 
Portrait drawing 
A portrait is a drawing of the face 
only with a neck and shoulders. it can 
be a human face or an animal face. 
Facial features 
facial features are the distinguishing 
elements of the face, there are 8 and 
they include the face, eyes, nose, ears, 
mouth, teeth, chin and hair. 
Facial Proportions 
The eyes are halfway down the head. 
The edges of the nostrils line up with 
the tear ducts of the eyes. 
The space between the eyes is 
approximately the width of an eye. 
The head is about five eyes wide.

Marc Chagall 
Chagall was born in Russia. He was 
the oldest of 9 children of a poor 
Jewish family. His father was a 
Herring fish merchant and his mom 
kept a shop in the front room. He 
painted at a very young age and went 
to art school for free because of his 
talent. Because he was poor he would 
paint on old curtains or shirts. 
Edvard Munch 
“Edvard Munch was born on the 12th 
of December 1863. Munch, a 
Norwegian, had four brothers and 
sisters. He had followed his mother 
and sister by being the best artists in 
their family. While Munch was still 
young, his parents, a brother and 
Munch's favourite sister died. This 
probably explains the bleakness and 
pessimism of much of Munch's work. 
It was when he was thirteen that he 
came to like art. The first paintings 
Munch did were simple objects like 
medicine bottles and other objects. 
Later on, he drew oil paintings. 
He went to a technical college in 1879 
where he learnt how to draw
