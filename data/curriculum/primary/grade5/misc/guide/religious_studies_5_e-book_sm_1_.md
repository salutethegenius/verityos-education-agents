GRADE 4
The beauty of God’s creation is revealed in many
scriptures. Genesis 1:31 states that everything
God created was very good. Psalm 19:1 tells of
His glorious handiwork. Psalm 139: 13 - 14 tells
how wonderfully the human body was created. 
The beauty of God is revealed in all the things He has created. His glory or
beauty is displayed in all of nature. Just as the sun gives light, God is the
Ultimate Light. The diverse colours and shapes found in creation reveal God’s
beauty and creativity. Romans 1:20 states how the invisible qualities of God are
seen in creation. 
God is a Sustainer. A sustainer is someone who upholds, maintains or supports.
God is a sustainer because He provides all the things creation needs to survive.
In His teachings, Jesus reminds us to not worry about food, clothing or shelter for
God knows that we need them (Matt. 6:25- 32). God takes care of the animals
and the plants. He sustains His creation through systems in nature like the water
cycle and food chain. The Bible also tells us that God protects His creation
(Psalm 91:11).

The Nature of God 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 138 - 139
       God is a Supreme Being. The word “supreme” means
highest in rank or authority. God is exalted high above all
spiritual and natural beings. There is no authority or power
higher than that of God. God’s many attributes make Him
supreme. 
       Christians use many terms to describe the attributes or
nature of God: Omnipotent: having all power and authority
(Jeremiah 32:17); Omniscient: having unlimited knowledge
(1 John 3:20b); Omnipresent: existing everywhere (Psalm
139:7-8; Eternal: having no beginning or end (90:1-2). 
       Christians believe that God is a Trinity of Persons. The
word trinity means three. God is one God (Deut. 6:4) who
exists as three divine persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
Each person in the Trinity performs different roles. 
       Several scriptures in the Bible reveal that God is a
Trinity of Persons. When Jesus was baptized (in Matthew
3:16-17), the voice of God was heard from heaven and the
Holy Spirit came in the form of a dove. In Matthew 28:19,
Jesus said to baptize disciples in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

Jesus Christ, the Son of God
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Jesus existed from the beginning of time,
before He came to Earth as a human being (John 1:1-2). Before Jesus
was born, an angel told Mary that she would give birth to the Son of
God (Luke 1:31-35). After Jesus was baptized, a voice from heaven
said, “This is my beloved Son” (Matt. 3:17). 
The Bible reveals that Jesus Christ came to Earth to:  
Do the will of the Father (John 6:38)  
Save sinners (1 Tim.1:15)  
Give eternal life (John 3:16)  
Preach the Good News and help people (Luke 4:18-19).
Jesus Christ’s coming to Earth was very significant. He was
the only one who could bring salvation (Acts 4:12) and give
us eternal life. He came to restore man’s relationship with
God and other human beings (John 17:6-11). Millions of
people are now called Christians because Jesus came to
Earth and died for the sins of the world. 
The main way individuals can demonstrate appreciation for
Jesus Christ is by accepting Him as Saviour. They would then
be able to demonstrate love for God and others. Worship is
another way to show appreciation for Jesus, our Saviour.

Miracles and Teachings 
of Jesus Christ 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Jesus Christ performed many miracles while on Earth to
demonstrate His divine power and love for mankind. He
cast out evil spirits to show His power over Satan. He
healed the sick, deaf and blind to demonstrate His power
to restore their lives. He raised the dead to show that He
had power over death. 
In the Bible, Jesus Christ told parables to teach about
God’s love and forgiveness. The parables, “The Lost
Sheep,” “The Lost Coin” and “The Lost Son” relate how
God feels about a sinner who seeks His forgiveness. He
loves and forgives all who turn to Him.
When individuals accept Jesus Christ as their Saviour, they
become His disciples. Disciples of Jesus should be
obedient, willing to deny themselves and suffer according
to Luke 9:24. They must be brave so that they can share
the gospel or Good News about Jesus (Matt. 28:19a). They
must be humble and serve others (Mark 9:35). Most of all,
true disciples must be loving so that others would know
they are Christians (John 13:35).
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 142 - 143

    Christians should always honour   
   the Holy Spirit in their lives. As they 
 obey God’s Word the presence of the
Holy Spirit will be with them. They must
not grieve or make the Holy Spirit sad by
their behaviour (Eph. 4:30). They can
honour the Spirit in worship and prayer. 
     The Holy Spirit is the Third Person in Trinity. The Holy Spirit works with the Father and
Jesus Christ. He is known as the Spirit of Truth (John 15:26), the Comforter and Helper
(John 14:16). He is a person because He speaks to people’s hearts, teaches, helps and
comforts individuals. 
     When we examine Scripture, we discover that the Holy Spirit is a part of the Trinity. In
Matthew 28:19, Jesus said to baptize disciples in the name of the Father, Son ad Holy
Spirit. In the famous benediction or grace in 2 Cor. 13:14, Jesus Christ, God and the Holy
Spirit are mentioned. 
The Holy Spirit comes 
into people’s hearts when 
they believe and receive salvation
(Acts 5:32). He helps Christians to
strengthen their faith as they pray and
abide in God’s love (Jude 1:20-21).
The Spirit helps Christians 
understand the Bible  (John 16:13).

The Fruit of the Spirit 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Longsuffering or patience is
produced when we wait for blessings
and go through trials. Gentleness is
produced when we respond kindly to
people around 
           us. When we do what is right  
             and perform good deeds  
             for others we are growing 
                in goodness. We cannot 
             produce these virtues 
                without the Holy Spirit. 
In Galatians 5:22-33 we read about the nine Fruit of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit
produces fruit in Christians as they grow in their faith. The fruit of the Spirit
indicates that the believer is becoming more mature. 
The following persons exemplified 
or exemplify longsuffering, gentleness 
and or goodness: Nelson Mandela, 
suffered for 27 years in prison for fighting 
against racism in his country. Mother Teresa 
exhibited gentleness and goodness when she 
served the poor people of India. Bishop Walter 
Hanchell and the staff at Great Commissions Ministries
exhibit goodness every day as their organization 
serves hundreds of poor and homeless people.

The Bible, Our Guide 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Throughout the Bible, we read about God’s love for mankind. God loved and
protected the Israelites, His chosen people (Exodus 12-16). Nehemiah 9:17
states that God is gracious and loving. Romans 5: 8 states that God loved human
beings while they were sinners and because of His love, Jesus Christ died.  
There are many areas of life where
Christians can apply biblical truths
such as:  
Relationships 
John 13:34; Eph. 4:2  
Daily provisions 
Phil. 4:8; Matt. 6:31-32  
Wealth 
Prov. 23:4; I Tim. 6:10  
Health 
Jer. 30:17; Prov. 17:22  
Positive thinking 
Phil. 4:8; Ps. 19:14 
Christians use the Bible to guide their
thoughts, daily actions and decisions.
Proverbs 3:5-6 instructs Christians to
trust God and let Him direct their
paths. When Christians face daily
challenges, they turn to the Bible for
help. 
When Christians live according to
God’s Word, they find joy and true
peace. They can find answers to
every problem.

The Book of Books 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 150- 151
The Bible is divided into two main sections, the Old and New
Testaments. The Old Testament is a collection of books about God and
His relationship with His chosen people, the Jews or Israelites. The
history of the Jews began with the story of Abraham.
 The five books of the Major Prophets
are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations
Ezekiel, Daniel. The twelve books of
the Minor Prophets include Micah, Joel
and Jonah. 
The books of history begin with the
story of Joshua being appointed to
lead the Jews into the Promised Land
and end with the return of the Jews to
Israel from Babylon. The prophetic
books warned the Jews about God’s
judgment and encouraged them to
turn back to Him. 
God 
made 
a 
covenant 
with
Abraham to bless him and all his
descendants. 
Therefore, 
He
showed great love and concern for
the Israelites. He rescued them
from slavery in Egypt and led them
to Canaan, the promised land. He
gave them laws to live by. He also
punished them when they did
wrong. 
Old Testament books are classified
according to their genre. The
twelve history books are from
Joshua to Esther.

Who Am I? 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
God created man with a mind that is free to choose between
right and wrong. Our choices can result in rewards or
consequences; therefore it is important to practise good
decision-making. The story of “The Lost Son” relates an example
of poor and good decision making.  
All human beings were created with equal worth and value
because we were created in the image and likeness of God.
(Genesis 1:27). Galatians 3:28 explains that all human beings
are equal as Christians. God blesses all people who “call to
Him” and saves them (Romans 10:12-13).
Because we are all created equal, we should endeavour to
follow The Golden Rule (Luke 6:31) and treat others with equal
respect. We should encourage our classmates to be kind to
others and avoid bullying. We should value those who are
different and be their friends. 
When we make a decision, solve a problem or create
something we demonstrate our unique ability to think and
make choices. Human beings are unlike any other creature
on Earth. We were created with the ability to think, reason
and make decisions.

Our Gifts and Talents  
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
There are many Bible characters who used their gifts and talents
successfully. Samson had supernatural strength and won many
battles in the name of the Lord. Dorcas (Tabitha) was a widow who
used the gift of sewing to help those in need. 
We should use our gifts and talents to help others and glorify God.
Helping at school or using our gifts in church are just some ways of
glorifying God. Volunteer work such as visiting a senior citizens’
home, a home for children or assisting in beautifying our
surroundings are other ways of using our gifts or talents to help
others. 
Gifts or talents are special abilities given to an individual. Our gifts
and talents are valuable because they help us to fulfil our purpose and
glorify God (Rev. 4:11). When we develop and display our talents,
we feel a sense of confidence and pride. We can also use our gifts and
talents to help others.

It’s Harvest Time Again
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Harvest festivals originated in the Old Testament with the Jews. God commanded
the Jews to celebrate the Harvest Festival when they began to harvest their crops
and the Festival of Shelters/Ingathering in autumn (Exod. 23: 16-17). Harvest is a
time to gather things planted and to honour God for His bountiful blessings. 
The first American Thanksgiving took place in 1621 when English settlers (Pilgrims)
shared their harvest feast with the American Indian natives who taught them to
hunt, farm and fish. Thanksgiving Day is now an American holiday recognized on
the fourth Thursday of November that celebrates that first bountiful harvest and
other blessings of the past year. 
Thanksgiving is represented by many symbols: Turkey: a symbol of abundance and
fertility Cornucopia: Also called the “horn of plenty” is a Greek symbol of
abundance, prosperity and bounty Corn: a symbol of agriculture and healthy
harvest Pumpkin: a symbol of the sun and its life-giving power 
The celebration of special days and festivals is significant. Individuals celebrate
special days to recognize milestones and bring people together. In the Christian
church, festivals help us to recognize the impact of Jesus’ life and His influence on
the church. The memory of such celebrations lives on for generations.

 The Birth of Jesus Christ -
Christmas
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Bible records many prophecies of the Jesus Christ’s birth. Genesis 3:15
foretells of one who will crush the serpent’s (Satan’s) head. Isaiah 7:14 foretells
of a pure young woman who will give birth to God’s son. Isaiah 9:6 tells that
Jesus will come as a baby. Micah 5:2 prophesies that Jesus will be born in
Bethlehem. 
Sin had created a separation between God and the people He created. It
caused the world to be filled with sadness, hate, fear, sickness and disease. Sin
also brought the penalty of death (Romans 6:23). Priests, judges, and kings
could not bring the peace the world needed. The birth of Jesus brought hope for
salvation and promise of peace. 
Christmas is a festival that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, the Messiah. Long
before Jesus was born, it was promised that a saviour would one day come to
save mankind from the punishment of sin (Isaiah 53:5). Jesus came to bring
mankind salvation and everlasting life (John 3:16).

GRADE 4
Created to Worship
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
We were created to worship God. Our worship of God can be personal (private time
spent in worship) or corporate (worship with other believers). Worship is more than the
acts performed during devotions or religious ceremonies. To worship is to live a life that
praises and honours God in all that we say and do at all times. 
As God’s creation we should have the heart of a sincere worshipper. The heart of a
sincere worshipper:  
Loves God completely (Deut. 6:5)  
Obeys God’s word (John 14:15)  
Serves God wholly (Romans 12:1)  
Tells others about Him. (John 21:17) 
In The Bible, there are many examples of persons who worshipped God reverently and
sincerely. In the Old Testament, Abraham was a sincere worshipper who loved God so
much, that he did not hesitate to sacrifice his only son when God told him to. The life of
Abraham’s son was spared because of his obedience. In the New Testament a woman
washed the feet of Jesus with her hair, her tears and an expensive oil. She was a sincere
worshipper who spared no expense in honouring Jesus.

Teach Us to Pray
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 162 -163
The Bible records many individuals whose prayers
were answered. Hannah, who was barren, prayed for
a son. God answered and she gave birth to Samuel (1
Samuel 2:1-10). When Solomon was appointed king,
he prayed for wisdom. God answered and he
became the wisest and richest man that ever lived (1
Kings 3:7-9). Jabez prayed for a blessing and God
granted his request (1 Chronicles 4:10). 
We all can pray to God. He loves it when we talk with
Him. When talking to God, use these simple steps as a
guide: 
C – Confess your need for Him. 
H – Honour God by praising Him.
A - Ask Him for what you need. 
T – Thank Him for answering your prayers
Prayer is important to the Christian faith. Three types
of prayers are petition, intercession and thanksgiving.
A prayer of petition is asking God to do something for
ourselves or for others (Living Prayers, 2013).
Intercessory prayer is a prayer of petition for other
people. A prayer of thanksgiving expresses thanks to
God for His goodness and blessings without making a
request of God. 
15


Christian Ceremonies
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Holy Communion was first observed by Jesus and His
disciples at the Passover meal. Jesus washed His
disciple’s feet (John 13:4-9) and served them
unleavened bread and wine (Mat. 26:26- 30). Jesus
said that the bread represented His body and the wine
His blood, shed for the forgiveness of sins. Holy
Communion is served faithfully in Christian churches
because of Jesus’ command (Luke 22:19). 
Christening, infant dedication or baptism is another
common Christian ritual. A ritual is a solemn ceremony
that follows a set format. During an infant’s
dedication, the baby, parents and godparents are
present. These individuals stand before a minister of
God. Then the child is prayed for and dedicated to the
Lord. In some churches, the baby is anointed with
water. As an infant Jesus was presented to the priest
Simeon for a blessing (Luke 2: 22- 38). This was a
common Jewish practice. 
There are many ceremonies practised in the Christian church. Holy Communion is a
ceremonial meal of bread and wine that observes the remembrance of Christ’s death.
It is sometimes called the Lord’s Supper or Eucharist. In some churches, foot washing
is connected to Holy Communion.

Caretakers of the Earth 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Bible contains many laws that encourage us to be good stewards of the
Earth. God gave the Leviticus Laws to protect the land, people and animals
(Exodus 21 – 23). One of these laws gave special attention to paying for
damage done to the land if there is a fire. Another law enforced repayment
for the injuring of animals under someone’s care.
A caretaker or steward of the Earth is someone who takes personal
responsibility for something in his or her care. We are to act as stewards of the
Earth. A steward of God’s creation is a keeper of the Earth (Flegal, 2018). We
can act as stewards of the earth through conservation and preservation. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 166 - 167
As stewards of the Earth, we should promote its conservation
and preservation. Conservation is the wise use and careful
management of the Earth’s resources. This means practicing
the Three R’s: reduce, reuse and recycle. 
Preservation is the protection of an area. We should
encourage others to care for the Earth. We can donate funds
to support national parks like The Union Creek Reserve on
Great Inagua, which helps with the preservation of native
plants and animals. 
17


Helping /Serving Others 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
In the Bible, there are many examples of persons
who supported and assisted others. In The Old
Testament, Ruth comforted and supported Naomi
after the death of her husband and sons (Ruth 1
and 2). In the New Testament, members of the early
church, like Barnabas, sold property and
possessions to give to anyone who had a need
(Acts 4: 32 - 37). 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 168 - 169
When individuals support or assist others, they feel a sense of fulfilment. They feel
that they are fulfilling their purpose in life and being good Christian examples.
Many people state that life is meaningless if it is not dedicated to serving others. 
Today, there are many ways to provide support and assistance for others:
Donate clothing, money, food, or toys that you do not need to those who can use
them. With the assistance of an adult, start a food, clothing or toy drive persons
can donate to. Volunteer your time. Along with an adult visit those who are sick
or shut-in. Join or support clubs or community organizations that help those in
need. 
18


Taking Care of Me 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
One way to care for your total being is to do all things in
moderation. Moderation is not overdoing something. Over-
doing certain activities like playing video games, eating or
spending too much time online can affect your physical,
mental and spiritual health. Exercise self-control by setting
limits to avoid overdoing certain things. You must balance
your time. 
God is concerned about our total
being. First Timothy 1:7 tells us that
God has given us a sound mind. John
14:27 says He gives us His peace. Third
John 1:2 tells of God’s desire for us to
prosper and be in good health. In
Mark 9, the story of The Frantic Father,
Jesus healed a man’s son who
suffered from mental illness. It is God’s
will for us to be healthy and whole. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 170 - 171
Individuals must plan ways to cope with all
aspects of their health. We build strong
bodies by eating healthily and exercising
regularly. Maintaining good mental and
emotional health means feeding the mind
and spirit positive thoughts. We should avoid
conversations, music, or shows that are
negative. We should give the body rest by
finding time to relax and getting sufficient
sleep. 
It is important to care for our total being: our physical, mental, emotional and
spiritual selves. Our total being is needed to effectively perform daily activities.
An unhealthy body makes it difficult to carry out simple tasks. A healthy mind
(the part of our body that thinks) and spirit (the part of you that connects to
God) are needed to make good choices and prevent stress, anxiety and
depression. 
19


The Value of Work
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Work is valuable to all human
beings. It allows individuals to
afford their basic needs like shelter,
food and clothes. It enables them
to have funds for entertainment
and relaxation. More importantly,
work helps individuals to express
their talents and to serve others. 
When God created Adam and Eve, He placed them in charge of the world. They had power over
the fish, birds and all animals. They were responsible to cultivate, guard and keep the Garden of
Eden organized (Gen. 2:15). This was the origin of work or manual labour. 
The Bible contains many proverbs about the
importance of work. Proverbs 14:23 states that an
individual must “work to earn a living” because
being idle will make you poor. Proverbs 13:4 states
that a hard worker “will get everything he wants.”
Proverbs 12:11 states that a hard-working farmer
“has plenty to eat.” This verse also suggests that an
individual must not waste time on “useless
projects.”

Be Fruitful  
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Bible expresses many truths about the benefits of having
children. Psalm 127:3 states that children are a “gift” or
“blessing” from the Lord. A woman rejoices when she has
children because the shame is gone (Psalm 113:9). Children
bring joy to the home. They also help to “bring parents closer
to God and develop their Christian character.” Children, in
the Bible days, assisted their parents by working (Gen. 4:2).
Today, children do chores at home and later find jobs. 
It is important for human beings to reproduce so that the Earth can survive. God
told Adam and Eve to be “fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth.”
Through reproduction, human beings can increase in numbers and“fill the Earth.”
They help to manage the Earth’s resources. 
Before God destroyed the earth by flood, he
instructed Noah to bring his family and two of
every living creature into the ark. Noah’s three
sons were married. God wanted them to have
children after the flood was over so the Earth
could continue. The animals would also be able
to reproduce.

Families Are Special
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Many Bahamian family traditions and values are based
on the Bible. The tradition of going to church is based
on scriptures like, Heb. 10:25; Acts 2:42 and Ps. 122:1.
The tradition of being neighbourly and being kind to
strangers is based on scriptures like Heb. 13:2 and Luke
10:25- 37. Important values such as being obedient,
honest and hardworking are based on the Bible.
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 176 - 177
Family traditions and values should be
preserved and passed on from
generation to generation. This will
ensure that the family stays strong. 
The family is the main or central part of any society. It is the
role of the family to “teach children skills, morals and values”
that will help them to become productive citizens. Children
normally adopt religious beliefs, work ethics and social skills
from their families.
Ways to preserve family traditions and values
include: 
Teaching truths from the Bible to our children
Telling stories about life, work and relationships
Having a mission statement for the family
Having family dinners and gatherings
Videotaping events and keeping photos

Families Build Communities 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 178 - 179
In healthy families, the members love and support
one another. They ensure that family members
fulfil their roles and potential. In unhealthy family
relationships, there may be neglect, lack of love
and even abuse. 
In the Bible, Noah’s family was an example of a
healthy family. They obeyed God’s laws and
worked together to build the ark for their safety,
during the flood. On the other hand, Joseph’s
family was divided because of jealousy and
dishonesty. They eventually solved their conflicts
and were united.
Strong families help to build strong communities. When family members
have strong values they display those values at school, church, work
and everywhere. They know how to develop good relationships and
make the community stronger.
Ways to build strong families and communities include:  
Read and study God’s laws
Express love and appreciation for each other
Spend quality time at home and with friends 
Respect each other’s space and alone time

A Community of Believers
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The church community is made up of different families.
These families support the church by dedicating their
time, talents and treasure to Christian service. The
church provides teaching, counselling and other
benefits for its members, to make them strong disciples
and good citizens. 
A church is a body or organization of religious believers
(Webster). This group can consist of people from diverse
nationalities and races. They form a community of believers who
share the same faith and meet often for fellowship. In
Christianity, there are many different denominations. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 180 - 181
The Early Church was a closely connected group of
believers. According to the book of Acts, they met regularly
in homes, ate meals together, prayed and learned about
being Jesus’ disciples. The miracles and teachings of the
apostles caused many people to join the Church. They
were persecuted by the religious leaders.
Today, Christian churches meet in small/large
buildings for worship and fellowship. At times, the
members fellowship in homes and church halls. Some
Christians around the world are persecuted for their
faith.

Journey through Holy Week
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The main events of Holy Week have great significance. 
Palm Sunday – Jesus Christ rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, in
 fulfilment of Zechariah 9:9. 
Holy Monday – Jesus honoured God’s house by chasing the money
 changers out of the temple. 
Holy Thursday - Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper or Holy
 Communion instructing His disciples to remember His sacrifice
. Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane and was tried 
by the religious leaders. 
Good Friday - Jesus died on the cross to save mankind and bring
 us back to God. 
Holy Saturday – Jesus remained in the grave awaiting His glorious
 resurrection. 
Holy Week is a significant period in the Christian church. It is a time
to reflect on Jesus Christ’s passion or suffering and death. During
the week, Christians fast, pray and participate in 
some of the special ceremonies of the church. 
They get to “travel through the suffering” before 
celebrating the joy of Easter.
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 182 - 183
Jesus Christ, who was without sin, suffered and died for the sins of the whole world. His
death symbolizes the greatest sacrifice that was made for mankind. Christians believe
that through the death of Jesus, their sins would be forgiven and they would be
brought back to God  (I Peter 3: 17-18).

 Celebrating Easter
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Christians believe that because of Jesus’ resurrection, they will also be
resurrected. The physical or mortal body that dies will be raised as a spiritual
body that is immortal and will live forever. Death will be destroyed forever. 
(1 Cor. 15:35-58).
The resurrection of Jesus Christ is very significant to the
Christian faith. If Jesus was not resurrected, then the
Christian faith would be “a delusion” or “vain,” and
there would be no salvation for mankind (1 Cor. 15:17).
Jesus defeated death and obtained eternal life for all who
believe.
Jesus Christ’s resurrection should be celebrated with much joy and excitement.
Ways to celebrate Jesus’ resurrection include:  
Give thanks to God for raising Jesus from the dead  
Visit a church near you on Easter Sunday  
Invite Jesus into your heart and receive eternal life  
Share the good news of Easter with others  
Plant a resurrection garden  
Remember that your life has purpose

Obeying Laws and Rules
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 186 - 187
God’s laws and the laws of society must be respected and
obeyed. Respecting God’s laws is a sign that we love Him and
love others. Respecting our country’s laws leads to peace,
safety and harmony in society. Respecting laws also shows that
we honour authority.  
Many biblical teachings provide guidelines for
the way individuals should live. The Ten
Commandments (Exodus 20) are laws that show
us how to love God and our neighbours. The
Beatitudes (Matt. 5:1-13) also teach us to how
live with the right values and attitudes. 
In societies good behaviour is rewarded
and bad behaviour is punished. When
people obey laws and respect each
other, they can enjoy a peaceful and
quite life. When individuals break the
laws of society or commit crimes, they
are tried in a court of law and punished
for their behaviour. Penalties for crime
vary from the paying of fines to
spending time in jail.

Factors that Influence Behaviour

PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 188 - 189
An individual’s behaviour could be influenced by
factors such as social media, movies and television.
Most children and teens spend a lot of time on
social media and they are affected by what they
experience. Movies and television affect how we
dress, act and even the language we use.
The Bible provides teachings that help to guide our behaviour and decision
making. Scriptures like, Phil. 2:3 and Rom. 12:10 teach us to be kind and
respectful of others. Scriptures like, I Cor. 10:31 and Phil. 4:8 teach us to be
careful what we watch and think about.
There are many Bahamian traditions that have influenced our behaviour. Such
traditions include storytelling, being good neighbours and going to church.
Storytelling is an excellent way to teach values and build character. Bahamians
have always practised being good neighbours based on biblical teachings
(Leviticus 19:18 and Luke 10:25-37). Going to church is a tradition all Bahamians
value. They learn Christian principles that they can use daily.

The basic rights of human beings are essential to their dignity, freedom and development. If
these rights are not protected then human beings would be devalued, neglected and even
abused. These rights empower human beings to live with dignity and reach their potential.

10:34 and Romans 10:12 teach us that God accepts all persons equally and we
should do likewise. Proverbs 14:31 warns against oppressing the poor. Psalm 15:5
encourages everyone to earn an honest living. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 190 - 191

The Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost after the
disciples had prayed and were in agreement. The sound
of wind was heard and “separate tongues of flame”
settled on every person there. The disciples were filled
with the Holy Spirit and spoke in other languages. This
was an extraordinary event.
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 194 - 195
Pentecost/Whitsun was a Jewish holiday in the Old Testament. It was
originally called the Feast of Harvest or Feast of Weeks. It took place fifty
(50) days after Passover. It was a time to celebrate the initial wheat harvest. 
The Early Church was greatly impacted by the coming of the Holy
Spirit. After Peter preached a message on the day of Pentecost,
about three thousand people were added to the church which
increased daily, as many individuals were converted. They met
regularly for prayer and fellowship. 
Pentecost is celebrated as the birth of the Christian
Church. Christians remember how the gift of the Holy
Spirit was poured out on the disciples. At Pentecost
believers were empowered by the Spirit for Christian
service. The Holy Spirit still empowers, comforts, guides
and gives spiritual gifts to believers today.

Christian Celebrations and Culture 
GRADE 5
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Bahamian culture has been heavily
influenced by Christian festivals.
Holidays, foods, music, art and specific
customs are all connected to the
various festivals. More importantly,
Christian festivals have helped to
influence the way we interact in
families and in the wider community. 
Christian denominations all celebrate the various festivals in special ways.

Wednesday. Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Baptists celebrate Holy Week with
special services especially on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Roman
Catholics, Anglicans and Baptist celebrate Christmas Sunday and Pentecost
Sunday with special services. Roman Catholics and Anglicans celebrate Advent

“Culture is a pattern of behaviour shared by a society or group of people.” Things such as
food, music, art, traditions and religion make up our culture. “Older people pass culture down
to younger people.” It changes over time when different cultures come together and with new
technology (Britannica Kids).
