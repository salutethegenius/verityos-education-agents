         The first people to
come to our island were the
Lucayans. The Lucayans were
very good sailors and
fishermen. They lived in huts
and slept in hammocks. They
were a peaceful people who
lived off the land in harmony
with nature. 
In 1492 three large boats
landed on the island. The
leader- Christopher
Columbus planted a long
pole with flag on the
beach.

SPANISH SETTLERS
ELEUTHERAN
ADVENTURERS
      The Eleutheran Adventurers,
after they landed in The Bahamas,
named the island the landed on,
Eleuthera, and settled there. Life on
the island was not easy so the group
began to trade wood for supplies, as
farming was not an option.
Eventually, Captain Sayle left
Eleuthera and moved to an island he
called Sayle Island which was later
renamed Providence. We now call
this island New Providence.

          Slaves received the
news of emancipation in
The Bahamas in 1835. Some
slave settlements were
Adelaide, Gambier, and Fox
Hill. Emancipation Day is
celebrated on the first
Monday in August, annually
in The Bahamas.
         After emancipation, many
freed slaves still returned to
former slave owners to work.
Some of them got land from
their former owners. They
faced challenges for better
education, decent living and
business. Whites controlled
most of the businesses.

they had to turn back to fishing

Blacks could only vote if
they owned property. Black
people were only allowed in
certain establishments and
schools in the Caribbean. 
            Most of the schools
were at elementary levels

High School was established
to give black people in The
Bahamas more than an
elementary education.

PIRATES AND BUCCANEERS
PIRATES AND BUCCANEERS
Later Spaniards chased
the buccaneers off
Hispaniola and they took
to the sea and became
pirates. 
Some famous pirates who live
in The Bahamas were: Edward
Teach- (Blackbeard), Anne
Bonny, Mary Reade, Jack
Rackham- (Calico Jack), Stede
Bonnet, Henry Morgan, and
Charles Vane.
       They hunted wild boar and
cattle and learned how to cure
meat from the Carib people. The
meat was cured over a boucan
near a slow burning fire. The
sailors sold the meat to passing
ships and therefore, they were
called buccaneers. 
          Woodes Rogers, the first
Royal Governor of The
Bahamas, rid The Bahamas of
pirates by offering them a
pardon to stop attacking ships
and by capturing, imprisoning
and hanging those who
refused to do so. 
         After this, trade was
restored and the motto
written in Latin was
Expulsis Piratus - Restituta
Comercia.
When pirates were driven
out trade was restored.
In the 17th century (1600s), many
buccaneers lived in the Caribbean.

          Bethel Baptist is the second oldest church in
The Bahamas. On 1st August 1790, the ground-
breaking ceremony for Bethel Baptist Meeting
House was held. Prince William and other freed
black people help to build the new place of
worship.  The Members of this church called
themselves Native Baptist Bethel Baptist Church.
        St. Matthew's Church also is the third oldest
place of worship on New Providence and has the
oldest original structure.  In 1799 the British
government donated some money for the building
of new church. The foundation stone was laid in
1800, and the first service was held in the new
church on 18th July 1802. 
                      In 1798, Scottish settlers founded St
Andrews Presbyterian Kirk. On 7th August 1810
they laid the foundation stone of the church. St.
Andrews Presbyterian Kirk is the second oldest

          In 1629, King Charles I of
England gave the lands of the
American Carolinas and The
Bahamas to his chief legal
advisor, Attorney – General Sir
Robert Heath making them
British territories.
           Settlers in The Bahamas obtained
 advice, help and trade from th

n, the Adventurers donated money
 to help build Harvard Colleg
e in Massachusetts. In 1670, King Charl
es II gave The Bahamas to th
e Lord Proprietors of Carolina. 
The Proprietors took over The
Bahamas to make money but
they had very little interest in
the islands.
             People living here were
expected to pay some of their
wages to the Proprietors but
often the people refused to
pay. 
           The rule of the Lord
Proprietors ended in 1718 when

as the first Royal Governor of
The Bahamas.

       Wrecking was a big
 business in The Bahamas i

       Once the ship was
wrecked, the goods were

        The Bahamas also
became richer; many
businesses flourished
and infrastructure was
improved from the
money made during the
blockade. Unfortunately,
crime also increased due
to population growth.
        These states were
more plantation states
with few industries. They
needed to use the ports
to export their cotton
produce to Europe to
trade for guns and
ammunition which they
could not manufacture,
but needed in order
to fight the northern
states. 
               During the American Civil War, from 1861 and
1865, all ships were prohibited from using ports in
the southern states of America. It was a blockade.

1861-1865
        Blockade means
that access to a
country’s port is
prevented.
            The American

the southern states
(Confederacy). 
       The Bahamas was
used as a route by which
the Southerners could get
these items from Europe.

             Bootlegging also referred to as rum-running
is the business of smuggling or transporting of
alcoholic beverages illegally.
        Many people in The Bahamas were
involved in smuggling liquor into
America from 1920 to 1933. This period
was called prohibition. Many people
made a living from bootlegging. 
            In 1919 the American government
passed an act which prevented its
citizens from manufacturing, selling,
importing or exporting liquors anywhere
in the United States. 
          Money was used to improve living
conditions for the rich as well as
infrastructure for tourists. 
               Some communities flourished,
especially the touristic/downtown
area. The ‘Over the Hill’ areas did not
benefit as much.

                       Cultural myths are special stories and beliefs that people in a
culture or society pass down from one generation to another. These myths
tell us about how the world started, why things happen in nature, and
important events from the past. Cultural myths are important because they
teach us about our values, traditions, and who we are as a group. They help
us remember our history, learn important lessons, and understand what is
right and wrong. Every culture has its own myths that are special and
different from others.
