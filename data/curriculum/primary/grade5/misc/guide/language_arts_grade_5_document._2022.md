PREFACE 
 
 
Several strategies were employed to assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum.  The process began 
with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions. These countries included Jamaica, the 
United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois), Canada, and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 guides). The 
documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their rationale and 
philosophy, the level of integration of sub-goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as well as the Scope of 
Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa and several other countries 
were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of English and the Ministry of 
Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.  
 
Opportunities were provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers throughout The 
Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted to be included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen (116) teachers 
throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students to get their feedback about 
what they wanted to learn and the types of learning activities they enjoyed.  Additionally, a focus group was conducted with 
members of the community that included business owners, parents, and those who interact with students in after-school clubs 
and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary school teachers, one preschool teacher, and a high school teacher.  Also, providing feedback were 
representatives from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment Section.  
Opportunities were also provided for several Family Island teachers to submit content and activities through the Education 
Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time engaged in 
research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction to meet the needs of their students.

MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
 
 
VISION 
 
Our vision is for a Bahamian education system that will foster academic excellence and equip students with multiple literacies, 
enabling them to make meaningful contributions as nation builders who are globally competitive. 
 
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of the Department and Ministry of Education is to provide all persons in The Bahamas an opportunity to receive a 
quality education that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and skills required for life, both in a 
democratic society guided by Christian values and in an interdependent and changing world.

BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. the learning environment should be student-centred; 
2. at each grade level, students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. all students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason, and make decisions as well as develop self-confidence 
and greater freedom of expression; 
5. all students should acquire essential survival skills, enabling them to function well in society; 
6. technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. the methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. thinking, speaking, listening, reading, and writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme and 
should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms, which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze these forms.

PROFILE OF THE IDEAL GRADUATE 
 
The principal objective of the Bahamian education system is to develop productive citizens capable of caring for themselves and 
contributing positively to the national development process. Based on its consultation with stakeholders, the Ministry of Education has 
developed a profile for the ideal graduate.  Among other qualities, the ideal graduate should: 
 
 possess relevant knowledge in core disciplines/learning areas to be functionally literate; 
 think critically, be an innovative problem solver and show initiative; 
 demonstrate creativity and innovation; 
 communicate effectively and collaborate willingly; 
 demonstrate flexibility and adaptability; 
 utilize social skills effectively;

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing sixth 
grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our students 
receive at the primary level lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that students can 
take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on communication skills.  During this period in our history, knowledge of basic communication skills is 
essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalisation of everyday services.  More and more people are being 
pushed to use online services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct banking transactions, to pay bills, 
to make travel arrangements, to access government services, and so much more.   Additionally, changes in technology 
demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Landlines, that only required listening and speaking 
skills, have been replaced with smartphones and computers that allow us to communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, 
send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the internet, buy tickets, post to social media, create blogs, conduct and 
participate in meetings from anywhere in the world, and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of 
communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be confidence that our education system will prepare students 
to communicate effectively, despite the changes that occur.  Recognizing that Language Arts skills are the foundation of all 
learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on producing students who are not 
only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability to communicate effectively in a rapidly 
advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves creatively, collaborate, and problem solve as 
we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Goal 4, which speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education 
for all…”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of Oracy, Reading, and Writing, teachers will have in their hands the 
tools to equip students with the fundamental skills that they will need to become lifelong learners and to navigate successfully in 
an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM 
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardization, teachers 
should familiarize themselves with its contents and should refer to it often as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area subjects 
and have students authentically apply these skills in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and 
senses are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual field trips, 
exposure to a wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, 
interactive learning centres, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level to provide teachers and parents with a guide for what 
students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This information should be 
used to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also indicates the level 
of proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become proficient in a particular area, 
teachers should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted to make 
them developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the end of the course of 
study.  Teachers should be guided by the content, which indicates what students should know or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three sub-goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading (Phonemic 
Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar, and Written 
Composition). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds on the 
previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided into three 
categories:  basic, intermediate, and advanced.  Depending on the level of their students, teachers can access content 
and activities at their grade levels or other grade levels, as they find it necessary to meet the needs of their students.   
 


25 
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  
Teachers are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines as well as to 
integrate them into the other Language Arts sub-goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of opportunities 
should be provided for students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with various audiences.  
They should engage in collaborative conversations with partners as well as in small and large group settings.  ZOOM, 
TEAMS, and other virtual platforms make it possible for conversations and collaborative projects to be organized with 
students in other schools, districts, islands and other countries, once the necessary safety protocols have been put in 
place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with students.  
Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the sub-goals.  To avoid duplication in the 
curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best applied.  It is expected that 
once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the strands and that they can be 
assessed across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This particularly refers to 
reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be highlighted.  Students are to be 
exposed to different types of literature as the various Language Arts skills are taught through teacher read-alouds and 
independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade level. 
 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales, and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics, and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels, and Science Fiction 
 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, 
during reading, and after reading. 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening 
           Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in reading still have opportunities to 


26 
 
understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (using pictures, video clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio 
clips, short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions as students connect skills to their everyday 
experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing if 
students have mastered the skill is to have them incorporate it into a writing exercise.  This will allow them to apply what 
they have learned.  Students who can apply reading skills would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy.  
Following this method of teaching comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated 
into the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the 
sitting of the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling, and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as ends 
in themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting; 
however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in the case of 
Grammar, where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should only be scored for 
what has been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week, the number of items on the checklist 
should increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the checklist should be continually 
reinforced.  By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been generated.  Students should be aware 
of what is contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to assess their writing before it is even 
submitted for marking.  Students’ writing should be marked for content, mechanics, and handwriting/presentation. 
Handwriting: grade one students should begin writing utilizing three lines until their fine motor skills are more developed 
and their letter formations are correct. During the third term of grade two, cursive handwriting can be introduced if 
students are ready. It is expected that cursive handwriting will be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, and 
words from the grade-level word list included in the appendices of this document.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A good listener is someone who 
engages in active listening. Good 
listeners strive to understand the total 
meaning of a communicated 
message.   
  
During informal settings, a good 
listener:    
 maintains eye contact;  
 shows empathy;  
 respects the opinions of others;  
 repeats key information when 
appropriate to do so to show

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Standard English is a term applied to 
language that is grammatically correct 
and with no Bahamian Dialect. It 
encompasses grammar, vocabulary, 
pronunciation, and spelling. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can get 
in the way of good communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class or 
with a more formal audience.   
Other occasions could be when 
conducting a class assembly, 
participating in a Christmas play etc. 
 
The Bahamian Dialect can be used when 
speaking in more informal settings like 
with family or friends.  It has its special 
vocabulary as well as a specific way of 
pronouncing words. It includes words 
like: 
 
dey = they 
ta = to 
dat= that 
he’en = he is not 
erry = every 
 
 
In addition to being used in informal 
conversations, the Bahamian dialect is 
often featured in Bahamian songs, 
commercials, plays, and novels. 
Basic:  Show pictures of different 
functions.  Have students 
determine whether it would be 
appropriate to use Standard 
English or Bahamian Dialect. 
Examples:  House of Assembly in 
Session, Junkanoo etc. 
 
Intermediate:  Play clips from a 
radio talk show on a topic to which 
students can relate.  Have 
students determine whether the 
dialect was used appropriately. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
translate the Bahamian Dialect 
into Standard English. 
 
Examples:  
 “I does make up my bed erry 
mornin’.” 
 
 “I make up my bed every 
morning.” 
 
Have students provide 
suggestions for the context in 
which the phrases/sentences 
would be appropriate. 
Take students outside.  
Draw a line to use as a 
divider.  Have students 
form a line on the 
divider.    Call off a list 
of several places or 
occasions one at a

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
When speaking, consideration must be 
given to the audience, occasion, and 
location. Sometimes adjustments have to 
be made to our regular speech. 
 
Volume refers to the loudness or softness 
of the speaker’s voice. Be aware of the 
environment and adjust the volume of 
speech accordingly. 
 
Examples: 
 At Junkanoo – very loud 
 At a Fair – loud 
 Near a sleeping baby – whisper/silent  
 
Rate means how fast or how slowly the 
person is speaking.  The rate can vary 
depending on the occasion. When 
speaking ordinarily, speak at a pace 
where people can comfortably understand 
what is being said.  If the person speaks 
too quickly, key information may be 
missed.  If the person speaks too slowly, 
the listeners might lose interest.  When 
speaking for dramatic purposes, the pace 
of speaking can sometimes fluctuate with 
the mood of the piece.  
 
 
Basic:  Have students repeat 
sentences like robots without 
intonation.  Then have students 
say them with proper expression. 
Discuss the impact on 
understanding the message that is 
being communicated. 
 
Intermediate:  Listen to a 
recording of the same song, like 
our National Anthem, by two 
different artists. Discuss how the 
renditions are similar and how 
they differ.  Relate this to the 
different ways in which we 
express ourselves. 
 
Advanced:  Have students watch 
a clip of a motivational speaker 
delivering a message.  Discuss 
the vocal characteristics that 
he/she used and the impact on the 
audience.  Have students write 
short speeches on something 
about which they are passionate.  
Have them deliver the speeches 
to the class.  Provide feedback on 
their delivery. 
 
Have students tell a 
story about 
something that 
happened to them.  
Use a rubric to 
assess their ability 
to speak clearly, 
audibly and with 
appropriate volume, 
pacing and 
expression.

Pitch refers to how high or how low the 
person is speaking.  Some people 
normally may have high-pitched voices, 
others may have low-pitched voices.  
When completing dramatic activities, the 
speaker may vary the pitch depending on 
who is speaking. 
 
Examples: 
baby- high squeaky voice 
giant – low deep voice 
 
Intonation refers to the rising and falling 
of the voice.  The voice may rise or fall if a 
question is being asked or a demand is 
being made.  The intonation may vary 
depending on the purpose of the 
statement.  A person speaking in a 
monotone does not have the rhythmic rise 
and fall of the voice.  There is only one 
tone being used. 
 
Pause – Sometimes speakers pause to 
conclude a point, for emphasis, to get the 
audience’s attention and to allow the 
audience time to think about what has 
transpired.

Example: Think about when the winner of 
a competitive event is about to be 
announced.  Quite often the speaker 
pauses, leaving the audience in suspense 
before continuing to announce the winner. 
 
Pronunciation – This refers to the 
correctness of sound in a word.  When 
speaking formally, ensure that sounds like 
the following are said correctly: 
 Words beginning with th. 
 Endings of words like ing, ed and s. 
Use tongue, teeth, and lips to produce the 
correct sounds.   
 
Facial expressions and gestures are a 
form of non-verbal communication that 
help to convey the emotions of the 
speaker.  
 
Examples:   
 If happy news is being delivered, the 
speaker might wear a smile. 
 If the listener wanted to show how big 
something was, they may spread their 
arms apart to demonstrate this. 
 
Facial expressions and gestures can help 
to keep the listeners engaged. They 
should not be overused as they can also 
distract.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A syllable is a unit of pronunciation. 
It is a word or part of a word with a 
single vowel sound. The number of 
syllables in a word is determined by 
the number of vowel sounds. Words 
can be divided into syllables.  
  
Syllabication helps in:   
a. Decoding words  
b. Reading fluently   
c. Spelling words accurately   
d. Dividing words at the end of a line 
when writing   
 
Example: In the word graceful, it 
would be “grace-ful” and not “gr-
aceful” or “gracef-ul”  
 
 
 
Basic:  Place students in groups. 
Give students word cards and 
rubber bands. Have students use 
the rubber bands to indicate 
where the word should be divided. 
Have them use this to call the 
words.  Have them match the 
correct syllabication rules to each 
word.   
  
Technology Adaptation:   
Write words on the 
whiteboard using the video 
conferencing tool 
or “whiteboard.fi” and allow 
students to annotate to divide 
words into syllables.

The letter ‘g’ can be pronounced as 
/g/ or /j/.  
   
Basic: Divide students into pairs.  
Provide them with ten cards on which 
they can write five words from their 
spelling list with the hard ‘c’ sound 
and five with the soft sound.  Have 
them shuffle the cards and place them 
face down on the desk in two rows.  
Students should take turns turning 
over two cards at a time.  The 
student should say the words and 
identify whether they have a 
hard ‘c’ or a soft ‘c’ sound. If they 
have both hard ‘c’ words or soft 
‘c’ words, the student can keep the 
cards.  If not, then they should be 
returned face down to the table.  The 
student with the most cards at the end 
wins.    
  
Intermediate:   Using content reading 
material, have students identify words 
with a specific sound (hard ‘c’, soft ‘c’, 
hard ‘g’ or soft ‘g’).  Have them record 
the sentence.  Provide them with an 
opportunity to share their sentences.

A consonant blend refers to two or 
more consonants that are sounded 
together.  Each consonant keeps its own 
sound when blended.  
   
There are four main basic forms of initial, 
medial, and or final consonant blends 
which are: r-blends, s-blends, l-blends, 
and n-blends.  
  
Sample Words:   
 
There are also blends that contain three 
consonants.  Common three consonant 
blends include: str, spl, shr, thr, scr, 
and spr.

Basic:  Provide students with a list of 
words.  Have them pronounce the words 
and tell if they hear an initial, middle, or 
final diagraph.  
Example:   march, that, washing.  
  
Intermediate: Divide students into small 
groups.  Have them listen to an audio 
recording of the reading of a word list. 
Ask them to determine the digraphs 
heard in the words. Students should be 
able to replay the list, start and stop it as 
necessary.  Have them use a chart to 
categorize words with the same 
digraphs.  Have them add additional 
words that utilize those same digraphs. 
  
Advanced: Give students a variety of 
sentences containing words with initial, 
middle, and final digraphs.  Have 
students decode words to determine the 
digraphs used.  
 
Example:  
Whales brush their teeth with swishing

When the consonant ‘r’ comes after a 
vowel or vowel, it sometimes changes 
the vowel sound. The letter ‘r’ makes 
the vowel have a sound that is different 
from the usual short or long sound. This 
special sound is considered ‘r-
controlled’.  
  
(Examples: heart /ar/, sports /or/, and 
curb /ur/)  
   
Sample Words

a table containing the “r-controlled” words 
with the /ar/, /ir/ or /or/ sounds. Ask them 
to underline the “r-controlled” vowel 
sounds.  Have them decode the words. 
  
Intermediate: Allow students to 
write a poem of their choice using “r-
controlled” words. Students should 
place emphasis on rhyming 
patterns and figurative language.   
 
 
Advanced:  Students can be an “r-
controlled” detective by searching

rule. Students will then make a bar graph 
and indicate how many times r -controlled 
vowels occurred. Have students use ten of 
these words to build sentences.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The /l/ sound at the end of a word 
can be spelt in several different 
ways.  
  
Generally, ‘al’ is used when adding 
a suffix on to a base word.     
Example: period - periodical  
  
Sample words  
carnival          criminal  
electrical        functional  
intestinal        maternal  
principal         tutorial  
  
Use ‘le’ if the sound is part of the 
word.  A consonant 
normally forms a part of this end 
syllable.  The ‘le’ ending is seen 
mainly after the following 
letters:  b, c, d, f, g, k, p, sl, st, t a
nd z.   
 
Sample Words  
ble – capable, possible, valuable   
cle –bicycle, particle, tentacle  
dle – saddle, rekindle, straddle  
fle – truffle, sniffle, unruffle  
gle – gullible, rectangle, struggle 
  
Basic:  Have students

Fish” by describing the word so 
that another classmate can figure 
out if they have that same word. If 
they do, they can use the words in

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A trigraph is a group of three letters 
that together form a single specific 
sound.  
 
The letter combination ‘dge’ is 
a trigraph because the three letters 
always function together to form the 
same sound as the letter “j”. 
Examples: widget, grudge, fidget   
  
When the /j/ sound is heard at the end 
of a syllable and it is immediately 
preceded by a short vowel, it is 
usually spelt ‘dge’.  
Example: porridge  
  
If there is a vowel and consonant 
team before the /j/ sound, it is spelt 
‘ge’. Example: ‘forge’ 
  
Sample List:  
smudge          cadge   
ecolodge        cartridge  
straightedge   wedge

Basic:  Have students create a set 
of picture word cards that represent 
words spelt with the ‘dge’ or ‘ge’ 
combination of letters. Pair them up to 
present their pictures to a partner.     
The partner will then have to identify 
the word using the picture and spell it.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Diphthongs are types of vowels 
where two vowel sounds are 
connected in a continuous, gliding 
motion (to make one sound). They are 
often referred to as gliding vowels.  
  
Examples of diphthongs are:  /oi/, 
/oy/, /ow/, /ou/  
  
The diphthongs ‘ou’ and ‘ow’ can have 
two distinct sounds.   
 
 /ou/ can sound like ‘ou’ as in 
‘ground’ and like ‘ou’ as in ‘soup’. 
 /ow/ can sound like ‘ow’ as in 
‘coward’, and ‘ow’ as in ‘glow’.  
  
Sample Words:  
needlepoint              steroid  
counsellor                accountant  
showered                 marrow    
employer                  voyage  
turquoise                  fountain   
  
If two vowels are beside each other in 
a word or syllable, the first vowel is 
usually long while the second vowel 
remains silent. This is called a vowel 
digraph.  
Basic: Have students identify the 
diphthongs and vowel digraphs by 
viewing words on flash cards that 
contain them. Allow students to circle 
the diphthongs and underline the 
vowel digraphs in each word.  
  
Intermediate:  Students can 
unscramble words with diphthongs and 
match each with its correct meaning.  
  
Advanced:  Have students write a 
cinquain using as many words as 
possible with diphthongs and 
digraphs. 
  
 
Have students read 
words in context that 
have the diphthongs

Alphabetical order refers to the 
organizing of a list of words in the order 
of the alphabet based on the letters in 
their names. This makes information 
easier to find in a dictionary, thesaurus, 
phone book, index, etc.  
  
There are specific rules as to the way in 
which words are organized in 
alphabetical order.  
  
Arrange words in order using their 
first letters.  If the first letters are the 
same, then use the second letters to 
determine the order in which the words 
should appear.  If those are the same, 
then move to the fourth and fifth letters.  
  
Example: detergent, determine, 
deterrent  
  
The names of people should be 
alphabetized based on their last 
names.  The first and last names 
should be separated by a comma.  
 
Example: Dominic Turnquest, Carl 
Smith, and Inez Major

Resources 
A dictionary contains a list of words 
arranged alphabetically.  The meaning 
for each word is explained and other 
important information is provided.    
  
Guide words - These words are at 
the top of the page in a dictionary or 
thesaurus. They are the first and last 
words found on that page.  
  
Etymology (origin of word) often 
appears in brackets at the end of the 
definition.  
  
Entry Word- This shows how the 
word is spelt. The entry word has dots 
to divide the word into syllables.  
   
Pronunciation- Pronunciations are 
found in a bracket immediately after 
the spelling of the word. This tells how 
to say the word. It is given in symbols 
that stand for certain sounds.  
   
Part of Speech- This tells how a word 
may be used in a sentence.  
   
Meaning- The different meanings of 
the word are numbered.  
Basic:  Place a spelling word 
on several index cards, then  
place cards face down. Choose 
a card and have students compete 
to be the first to find the word in the 
dictionary. Have them look for the 
target information.  
 
Examples: etymology, part of 
speech, pronunciation   
  
Technology Adaptation: Call 
a word. The students (individually 
or in teams) must find the word as 
quickly as possible. The first person 
to unmute and call out the correct 
origin, spelling, synonym, or part of 
speech etc. wins the point. 
  
Intermediate:  Place students in 
groups.  Have students pass 
around words on word cards as a 
piece of music plays.  When the 
music stops, have students locate 
the word in the dictionary and 
record its meanings, synonyms, 
and spelling on a chart. The first

An abbreviation is a shortened form 
of a word that ends with a period.   
  
In abbreviations you will notice that:   
  
1. Most are spelt with the first    
    letters of the word.   
     Example:  advertisement – ad. 
 
2. Some are spelt with a  
    combination of letters from the  
    word.   
    Example:  international – intl. 
  
3. Others are spelt with  
    letters not found in the original  
    word.  
     Example:  pound – lb 
 
4. Many abbreviations begin with a  
    capital letter.  
      Example:  Doctor – Dr. 
 
5. Add a period to an abbreviation  
    when it does not include the last  
    letter of the whole word.  
    Example:  negative – neg. 
 
 
Basic: Provide students with a list 
of words.  Have them provide the 
abbreviations for words on the list.

Objective 2.29 Identify the base word, prefix or suffix in words and the meanings associated with them. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Words often contain base words. A 
base word is the part of a word that can 
stand alone and has meaning.  It is 
the simplest form of the word.  
  
Example: ‘Write’ is a base word that 
means ‘compose’.  
   
Prefixes and Suffixes can be added to 
base words to change the meanings of 
these words.  
  
Prefix – A prefix is a word or syllable 
that is added at the beginning of a base 
word. Prefixes have their own special 
meanings too.  
  
Example: 
The prefix ‘re’ means ‘again’. The 
word ‘rewrite’ means to ‘write again’.  
  
Sometimes prefixes have similar 
meanings, like ‘im’ and ‘non’.  They 
both mean ‘not’.  
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Distribute several cards with 
root/base words, prefixes, and 
suffixes. Students will manipulate the 
word cards to form as many words 
as possible.   
 
 Examples:  cycle, un, re, ful, 
wrap, help, like  
 
 Possible Words: recycle, 
unwrap, helpful  
   
Intermediate: Have students match 
prefixes/suffixes and their 
meanings.  
   
Advanced:  Have students play 
“Word Builders” game. Each student 
will be given a sheet of paper divided 
into three column headings –
Prefix, Base Word, and Suffix. Each 
student will write ten base words in 
the appropriate column. They will 
then exchange papers with a partner 
who would add a prefix and a suffix 
to each base word to form a new 
word. Students will have to provide 
the meaning of the new word 
formed. 
Have students read 
a paragraph.  Ask 
them to identify base 
words that contain 
prefixes or suffixes.  
Have them write the 
meaning of the base 
word and its new 
meaning based on 
the prefix or suffix 
that was added.

A suffix is a letter or group of letters 
added after a base word to alter its 
meaning and form a new word.

An inflectional ending is a word part 
that is added to a base word.  This 
ending can make a word plural, 
change word tense or help to make 
comparisons.  Some inflectional 
endings are:   s, es, ing, ed, er and 
est. 
 
1.  Adding ‘e’ and ‘est’   
 If the word ends in a ‘consonant’ and 
‘y’, change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’. Example: crazy - craziest  
 
If the word ends in a ‘consonant’ and 
‘e’, remove the ‘e’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’. Example:  wide - widest 
 
If the word ends in a consonant vowel 
consonant, double the last letter, and 
add ‘er’ or ‘est’.  
Example: fat – fatter/fattest 
 
Sample Words: 
 
closest 
cuter 
fanciest 
ghastliest 
prettiest 
 
whiter 
strangest 
 
 
 
Basic: Create a worksheet for 
students to complete where 
they have to follow the rules 
to add inflectional endings.   
  
Intermediate: Using a 
newspaper, or magazine, 
have students work in groups 
to list at least 50 inflectional 
words, as they appear in 
articles.  
   
Advanced:  Have students 
create a pop-up book which 
explains the use of inflectional 
endings. They must use a lot 
of examples with pictures.  
 
Have students complete 
a quiz where they have 
to add inflectional 
endings to words.

Objective 2.32 Distinguish between the British and American spelling of commonly used words. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The two main spellings used in The 
Bahamas are a mixture of British 
English and American English. It is 
important to distinguish between the 
two because of the spelling and 
pronunciation differences.  
  
British English keeps the original 
spelling of words that is used from 
other languages, mainly French and 
German.  
  
American English spellings are 
usually based on how the word 
sounds when it is spoken.  
  
When writing, do not switch between 
the British and American spelling. Be 
consistent with the spelling selected 
throughout.  
 
Some spelling differences can be 
found at the end of words or the 
spelling changes completely.   
The endings of words may differ 
depending on whether the British or 
American Spelling is used. 
 
 
Basic:  Allow students to 
complete a worksheet 
distinguishing between British and 
American words (see Resources).  
 
Intermediate: Give students five 
to ten words to decode, using a 
cipher key. Have them write the 
word on a sheet, then state 
whether it follows American or 
British spelling.  
 
Example: 
A= 7  
B= 10  
C = 26  
 
Advanced: Engage students in a 
quiz using a gamification 
platform of your choice, where 
they identify the British and

Not all the words spoken in English are 
English words.  Their roots were formed 
in another language. Being able to 
recognize certain roots can assist with 
spelling and in understanding what 
particular words mean.  It can also help 
to see connections between words.  
  
Japanese  
Japanese is one of the newer 
languages to have some of its words 
adopted into the English 
language.  Symbols are used to 
represent words in this language.  
  
The long /e/ is often spelt with an i at 
the end of words.  
 emoji  
 hibachi  
 origami  
 sushi  
 tsunami  
  
In some words, however, the /e/ is 
spelt e.  
 karate  
 karaoke  
  
Basic:  Play audio clips of the 
language so that students can hear 
how certain words are 
pronounced.   Have students use 
this information to practise saying 
their spelling words correctly.  
  
Intermediate: Have students use 
their smart phones to take pictures 
of other words that have originated 
from the target language.  Have 
students give each other mock 
spelling tests on these words.  
  
Advanced:  Have students review 
the spelling rules related to a 
specific language.  Present them 
with unfamiliar words that follow 
that same pattern.  Have them use 
the rules to spell the words.  
 
Have students

It is important, when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at which 
you are reading, the rise and fall of 
your voice and expression.  
  
Rate – Refers to how fast or how 
slowly one speaks.  Be careful not to 
speak so slowly that listeners lose 
interest. Do not read too quickly, 
otherwise the words may not be clear 
and the listeners may find it difficult to 
follow.  
  
The control of breathing when reading 
can be used to influence rate or pace. 
If someone is running or crying, use 
quick short breaths between the 
words.  If someone is relaxed, this 
may be portrayed by breathing out 
slowly.     
  
Intonation – This refers to the rise 
and fall of the voice to reflect what is 
happening in the reading piece.  
  
 
Vocal Expression – The tone of the 
reader should reflect the mood of the 
piece.   
Basic:  Have students practise 
reading texts at different rates to 
portray excitement, fear, and 
sadness.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students listen 
to a Bahamian storyteller sharing a 
local tale.  Ask them to discuss the

Text structure refers to how an author 
organizes information in a text. Being 
aware of non-fiction text structures and 
their purpose, helps readers to navigate 
the text that they are reading.  There are 
five basic structures that authors use. 
 
Description - Provides a variety of 
information about something that is alive, 
such as a person, animal or plant; 
something that is not alive like an object 
(weather wind vane); an event such as 
when The Bahamas gained Independence 
on 10th July, 1973; a process (liquid 
changing to gas) or a place (the 
Hermitage on the island of Cat Island).        
 Examples:  brochures, menus.               
 Keywords/phrases: for example, the 
characteristics of    
 
Sequence - Provides the order in which 
something happened or should happen.   
 Examples:  agenda, directions to 
locate something or some place  
 Key Words: first, next, finally 
Basic: Create a text structure, 
student-made anchor chart that 
outlines the definitions, 
examples, key words and 
graphic organizers that are used 
for that specific component. 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
read various short passages.  
Ask them to highlight key words 
and identify text structures. 
 
Advanced: Have students read 
two passages on the same topic 
with different text structures.  
Then have them discuss and 
evaluate which text structure 
used was more effective.

Resources 
A well-written narrative has five core 
elements. Being able to identify these 
elements and knowing how they work 
together in a story, helps a reader to 
better understand and appreciate the 
text. 
 
The five core elements of a 
narrative are: 
 
Character: the people or animals and 
objects behaving like humans in the 
story. To learn more about the nature 
of a character, a good reader pays 
attention to his/her words, thoughts, 
actions, and appearance. A person’s 
nature is his/her usual attitude or 
behaviour. In most stories, the nature 
of a character remains the same 
throughout the story or changes after 
a dramatic event. 
To figure out the nature of a character, 
ask yourself: 
 What thoughts is the character 
having? 
 What is the character saying? 
 How is the character acting? 
Basic: Bigger than Life Choose a 
story familiar to the students and 
select a character. Using the Think-
Aloud Strategy, draw a large life-
size sketch of this character based 
on any descriptions given in the 
story. Quote phrases directly from 
the book and place evidence of the 
character’s [1] thoughts and words 
on the head and [2] actions on the 
feet and hands. Use the “Interpreting 
the Nature of Character” guiding 
questions to infer about and place [3] 
their personality on the heart. 
 
Working in Pairs:  In groups of two, 
assign familiar characters to each 
student group. Allow them to follow 
the same procedure as above to 
create a life-size sketch of this 
character. Carve out time for 
students to present their models. 
Extend this activity to incorporate 
teachings on the character’s point of 
view and conflict.

Setting: the location and time of a 
story. It can be about a place that is 
real or fictional and about a time that 
is in the past, present or future. If 
the author does not identify the 
setting, a good reader looks for details 
to figure it out such as the weather, 
time of day, buildings, and seasons. 
The setting can put the audience in a 
certain mood while reading the text. 
However, not every setting is 
important to the story. 
 
To determine if the setting is important 
a reader should ask:

Plot: the order of the most important 
events in a story. The four (4) main 
parts of a plot are: the background 
(introducing the setting and 
characters), a conflict, the climax, 
and a resolution (how the problem is 
solved). 
The conflict of a story is something 
that goes wrong for the main 
character. The main character can 
face a conflict with [1] himself, [2] 
another character, [3] culture or [4] 
nature. In most cases, the character 
then takes action to solve this 
problem. Good readers know that 
there may be more than one major 
conflict in a story. 
The climax is the most exciting part of 
the story. In most stories, this 
happens right before the problem is 
solved. Being able to follow a clear 
plot helps a reader to better 
understand, enjoy and evaluate the 
author’s work.

lesson that the author wants the 
reader to learn from a story. It is

usually a lesson to better the reader’s 
life and their relationships with others. 
Some common themes are 
perseverance, courage, tolerance 
and change. These themes are 
known as universal themes. 
 
To figure out the theme of the story, 
ask yourself: 
 Did the main character change 
after solving the problem? 
 What lesson did this experience 
teach the main character about 
being a better person? 
 Can this lesson also help me 
become a better person or have a 
better relationship with others? 
 
There can be more than one theme in 
a story. In this case, ask yourself: 
“Which theme seems to be most

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Context Clues are the words that 
surround an unfamiliar word.  These 
words give clues about the meaning of 
the new word.  Some context clues are: 
  
Synonyms – Words that mean the 
same or almost the same as an 
unfamiliar word.  
 
Example:   
The oldest lighthouse in The Bahamas 
is situated or located Paradise Island.  
 
Antonyms – Sometimes a context clue 
would contrast with new word.  
 
Example:   
Unfortunately, it was not the drizzling 
type of rain, but the drenching kind as 
Audra emerged from the hairdresser’s 
shop.   
 
Definition – This is the kind of context 
clue where the writer gives the meaning 
of or explains a word in a sentence.  
 
 
Basic: Provide each group of students 
with a paragraph (large print) that 
contains a few words. Have 
“synonyms” for these words available.  
Provide students with glue and have 
them paste the words in the correct 
positions on the chart.  Have students 
then read the paragraph with the 
replaced words.  Ask them to explain 
what helped them to make their 
choices. 
  
Intermediate:  Prepare dominoes 
(index cards) with a sentence on one 
end and a word on the opposite end.  
Students will follow the rules of 
dominos and match unfamiliar words 
with their synonyms. This could be 
done as a group or class activity.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Making predictions involves using the 
information that has been provided by 
the author along with what you know 
already from past experiences or 
knowledge, to figure out what will happen 
next. Predictions must be relevant to the 
situation and logical.  
  
A reader can make inferences and draw 
conclusions to make better predictions 
during reading when more information is 
provided.  
 
To make a good prediction before and 
during reading a fictional text, ask 
yourself,   
 What is the title telling me about the 
characters? The setting? The events?  
 What are the clues in the story telling 
me about the main problem? 
 What do I think the main character 
will do next to solve this problem?  
 What would I have done next in this 
situation? 
 
 
 
To make a good prediction before and 
Basic: Place students in small groups.  
Instruct them to use the title and other text 
features to make an initial prediction about 
the story’s plot.  Have students write their 
predictions and the clues that were used 
on a chart.  Groups can share these 
predictions as well as those 
made throughout the reading of the 
passage.

Allow students to read short passages and 
then use the graphic organizer to write 
their predictions.  Have students explain 
why each prediction was made.

passage and identify any clues that they 
may have missed.

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The main idea of a text is the 
most important idea that the 
writer wants you to know about 
the topic. It is what is mostly 
being talked about in the text. 
Knowing the main idea helps a 
reader to better understand and 
organize the lesser details of the 
text when summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and retelling.   
 
Sometimes, a writer directly states 
the main idea in the text. It can be 
stated at the beginning of a 
paragraph as the topic sentence 
or the end as the concluding 
sentence. However, the main 
idea can also appear anywhere in 
the text.   
 
Sometimes, the main idea is 
unstated and the reader must 
figure it out from the supporting 
details. The supporting details 
are the sentences that tell us 
more information about the main 
idea. There are five main types 
of supporting details:  
[1] examples, [2] facts and figures, 
Basic: What is The Big Idea? Give each 
student a card with a list of words and phrases 
that supports an unknown topic. One at a 
time, read aloud a topic and challenge 
students to decide if it is the matching main 
idea for their details. Pause to allow students 
to self-correct or challenge the matches of 
others. Lead from the activity to discuss main 
ideas and supporting details.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Sequence is the order in which things 
happen.  Sequence also refers to steps 
in a process such as a recipe or 
directions.  
  
Authors may use key words or phrases 
to help readers understand sequence.    
  
Key/Signal Words:  after, before, 
while, then, next, first, last, later 
meanwhile, during, 
finally, Wednesday, and in the 
morning     
  
Dates tell you a specific month or year.  
 
Key words such as ‘meanwhile’ and 
‘during’ are clues that two or more 
events are happening at the same time. 
If there are no clue words, picture the 
events from the story in your 
mind and ask yourself, “What happened 
first, next, then and last?”  
   
In writing, bullets, numbers, and 
numerals can be used to indicate 
sequence.  
 
Basic:   Have students read and 
follow directions for a science

Most stories are divided into two major 
genres: fiction and non-fiction. The 
Latin word genre means ‘group’ or 
‘kind’. 
 
Knowing whether a story is fictional or 
realistic can help the reader to better 
understand the ideas of the author and 
make reasonable predictions. Good 
readers slow down when reading 
nonfiction to think about what is being 
communicated. 
 
The fiction genre has stories that are 
created from the authors’ imaginations. 
It refers to things that are invented or 
not true. Examples of fictional stories 
include: fairy tales, legends, 
historical fiction, science fiction, 
folklore, mythology and realistic 
fiction. 
 
Fairy Tale - stories about magical 
creatures with happy endings, usually 
written for children. 
 
Fable - stories where animals, plants or 
objects are behaving like humans. The

The graphic organizer that is 
commonly used to compare and 
contrast is called a Venn Diagram.  
 
 
Basic:  Have students read two short 
stories (fables or fairy 
tales).  Students will compare and 
contrast the characters, setting, plot, 
and theme of the short 
stories.  Students can put information 
on a Character Comparison Frame 
(Literacy Resource Handbook). 
   
Intermediate: Instruct students to 
compare prices and products of two 
stores in their neighbourhood or two 
lunch vendors at school. Allow them to 
write a paragraph that makes a 
comparison between the two.  
Encourage them to use keywords.   
   
Advanced:  Have students read 
articles on the same topic from two 
local newspapers.  Have them 
compare and contrast the articles 
and/or the authors’ perspectives or 
styles.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The author does not always directly tell 
the reader everything that is happening 
in the story.  However, the writer gives 
hints or clues so that the reader is able to 
figure out what is not stated directly.  
Good readers use the information given, 
along with what they already know, to 
make inferences. 
 
There are several different types of 
inferences that can be made. 
 
1. Object – Authors may give clues as 
to what an object might be.   
 
To figure out clues about the object, 
ask the following questions.   
1. For what purpose is the object 
being used?   
2. What sensory details are being 
provided?   
3. Where is the object located? 
 
Example:  Its diamond shape 
moved easily in the wind.  We tied 
bows on its tail so that it would 
dance gracefully for us. What is the 
object?  It is a kite.  
 
Basic: Have students review 
several store receipts with 
purchased items and make 
inferences about what the person is 
going to make. 
   
Example:  
 Flour 
 Yeast 
 Lard 
 
Using the store receipt, have 
students infer what the person is 
about to make. 
  
Intermediate: Have students  
write riddles where inferences 
must be made in order to solve 
them.  The riddles should be 
related to objects, categories and 
instruments.  Have students share 
riddles and discuss word clues.  
   
Example:  I am a native Bahamian 
dish.  You can purchase me at the 
Fish Fry.  My main ingredient is a 
mollusk. I also contain lime and 
various herbs?  What am I? Conch 
Have students 
complete a task card

make inferences.

2. Category - Authors may sometimes 
use names or words with which the 
reader is not familiar.  If they provide 
more than one example, the reader 
can use this information to identify the 
group to which the items or objects 
belong.   
 
To figure out clues about the object, 
ask the following questions.   
1. What is the location of the 
items/objects?   
2. What type of items/objects are 
they?   
3. For what are the items/objects 
used?

pain. What is the object that the 
nurse is holding?  A needle. 
 
Quite often inferences made, have to be 
defended.  These questions or

forms, but they are all asking the reader 
to provide the clues from the passage

A cause is an action or idea that 
makes something happen.  An effect 
is what happens because of this 
action or idea.  
   
A cause can have more than one 
effect as well as an effect can have 
more than one cause.  To find 
the cause-and-effect relationship 
during reading, a good reader asks:  
 
 
What happened? (Effect)  
 
Why did this happen? (Cause)  
   
Sometimes, an author or speaker may 
use a signal word to show a cause-
and-effect relationship.  
   
Key/Signal Words:  
because, since, when, as a result, 
therefore and so

A generalization is a broad statement 
that tells about a group of people, 
animals or things and what they have 
in common.  
  
Example:  All Bahamians love 
Junkanoo.  
   
 
Generalizations can be valid or

supported by facts, while faulty 
generalizations are not supported by 
facts.    
  
Clue words that often signal valid 
generalizations are: some, most, 
sometimes, often, probably, few, 
many, rarely  
  
Clue words that often signal faulty 
generalizations are: everyone, 
nobody, all, none, always, never.  
Some generalizations do not have 
signal words.  
 
Example:  Regatta is a traditional 
event that Bahamians enjoy.  
 
Basic: Spot the Generalization  
Provide students with groups of 
sentences.  One sentence in each group 
should be a generalization while the 
others are not.  Have students highlight 
the one that is a generalization and circle

Resources 
Every author has a reason for writing.  
This is known as the author’s purpose. 
There are four common reasons for  
writing:  
 
To Inform - When writing to inform or 
explain, the author uses facts. This is 
known as expository writing. 
Examples: cookbooks, science, history 
textbooks, and biographies  
 
To Entertain - Many stories, plays, and 
poems are written to teach a lesson or 
simply amuse its audience. This is also 
known as narrative writing.  
 
To Describe - An author may describe an 
event, scene, or person in detail. Words 
that appeal to the senses of the reader or 
listener are used. This is known 
as descriptive writing.  
 
To Persuade -Sometimes an author tries 
to persuade readers to agree with him or 
her or to take a particular action. This is 
known as persuasive writing. Examples: 
most commercials, campaign speeches, 
and advertisements.  
  
Basic:  Newspaper Search  
Have students look through 
newspapers and work in groups to 
find articles that match each 
author’s purpose.  
   
Intermediate: Talk Shows

students use the opening lines to 
identify the purpose for the talk 
show or vlog. Have them identify 
the author’s viewpoint.

Authors sometimes use propaganda 
techniques to influence the opinions, 
emotions, attitudes, or behaviours of 
readers.  There are several main 
propaganda techniques.   
 
 Bandwagon – Gives the impression 
that everyone is doing a particular 
thing and that is why readers should do 
it as well, so that they are not left out. 
Example: “Everyone will be paying a 
dollar for ‘Dress up Day’.  You will be 
the only one in uniform.” 
 
 Glittering Generalizations – Are 
statements that make people feel 
good.  They can be based loosely on 
people’s beliefs and morals.  They are 
positive in nature.   
Examples: 
1. “You are worth it!” 
2. “You deserve a break.” 
3. “Eat fresh…pick from our organic 
veggies.”  
 
 Name Calling – This is used to show a 
person or a product in a bad light.  
Example:   One brand of ketchup 
might be called “thin” and “watery” 
while another may be called “thick” and 
“flavourful”.

 Testimonial – Celebrities, social 
media personalities, public figures and 
movie starts may be used to endorse a 
product or a belief.   
Example: “Basketball player, Tim 
Smith, eats Wheaties to keep him 
making those jump shots.” 
 
 Transfer – This is the transfer of a 
good quality or a bad quality on to 
something else by association. 
Example:  Shaunae Miller-Uibo and 
Aliv.  Because Shaunae Miller-Uibo is 
fast on the track, Aliv’s internet is also 
fast. 
 
Regardless of the author’s purpose, there 
are clue words in his or her writing that tell 
us how the author feels or his/her 
viewpoint about what has been written.  
 
To find out how the author feels about a 
piece of writing, ask the following 
questions. 
1. Are there “feeling” words included in 
the piece, such as good, bad, great, 
fantastic, terrible etc.? 
2. How is the event, person, thing, or idea 
being described? irresponsible, 
organized, interesting, boring etc. 
3. Are negative or positive words being

used in the piece?  distasteful, tasty, 
satisfying, dissatisfied, filling etc. 
4. Does the author appear to be arguing 
for one side over another? 
 
Examples: 
 
Informative Piece – Crabbing is so much 
fun!  Before going, you need to make sure 
that you have all your tools such as a 
searchlight, a bag to put the crabs in, a 
stick and perhaps a pair of gloves. Once 
you have these materials, you are all set.  
Let the adventure begin! 
 
 How does the author feel about 
crabbing?  
 
 Are there clue words that tell us how 
the author feels? The word “fun” is 
used to indicate that crabbing can be 
an enjoyable experience.  The author 
also looks at it as an adventure. 
 
Descriptive Piece- The ground was 
soggy and wet!  What was once soil was 
now gathered into little mounds of mud.

 How does the author feel about 
what he is writing?  Does the author 
use descriptive words to describe 
the playing field and their uniforms?  
The author describes the field as being 
“soggy”, “wet” and “muddy”.  He also 
refers to “irritating squishing sounds”. 
The uniforms were “soaked” and 
covered in “brown spots”. They were 
stomping through the mud which 
indicates anger.  He indicates that the 
game they had been waiting to play is 
now ruined.   The author is probably 
feeling disappointed and a little angry 
about the rain.    
 
Expository Piece – Visiting the island of 
Inagua is one of the best decisions you 
can make.  It has the lovely flamingos, 
the curious, wild donkeys, and the 
magnificent salt ponds.  There is also a 
special place by the pumps where fish 
can be found in abundance. 
   
 Are the descriptive words negative or 
positive?  Do they give us clues as to 
how the author is feeling? The author 
uses words such as “best”, “lovely”, 
“magnificent”, “special” and

Inagua. 
 
Persuasive Piece- One of the best things 
you can do in this life is to take care of 
your teeth.  Brush and floss after every 
meal and you will not be sorry. This will 
help you to avoid getting harmful 
cavities and discoloured teeth.  You 
would never have to get needles in your 
gums to numb the pain while the dentist 
fills the cavities.  Work hard to keep them 
milky white and strong!  You won’t be 
sorry. 
 
 What are the clue words that tell us 
how the author feels about taking care 
of our teeth?  “best”, “you won’t be 
sorry”, “avoid getting harmful cavities 
and discoloured teeth”. The author also 
encourages readers to “work hard…”

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Making judgements is more than just 
forming an opinion about characters, 
things, events, and ideas in a story or 
article that may have no 
consequence. Judgements are 
decisions that are made based on 
evidence found in the passage, what 
the readers know and the reader’s 
own experiences, beliefs, morals, and 
values. 
   
When reading fiction, readers make 
judgements about the decisions and 
actions of characters in a story. They 
may agree or disagree with a 
character’s actions.  They may also 
decide if a character or an action is 
fair or unfair, wise or foolish, or 
generous or selfish.    
   
When reading nonfiction, readers 
make judgements about the author 
and the ideas, facts and 
opinions presented.   
 
To do this, readers should consider 
the following:  
 What is the author’s reason for 
writing the selection?  
Basic: You be the judge!  Invite 
students to be judges for the lesson.

People in different countries have their 
own unique way of expressing 
themselves. The Bahamas is no 
different. This type of expression is 
called colloquial expression.  This is 
an informal way of speaking 
to others.  Below is a list of common 
expressions used.  
  
Examples:   
 Toter- Someone who carries food 
from a party or function, wrapped in 
foil.  
 What you sayin’! – A greeting that 
invites the other person to share 
how they have been doing 
 Well mudda sick! - Oh my gosh! 
or You’re kidding!  
 Slop bucket - a pail that is used as 
a toilet 
 Monkey Tambrin -poison bush that 
causes itching  
 Benny - a grain (Sesame) cooked 
with sugar to make sweet cakes.  
 
Basic: Play portions of several 
Bahamian songs like “Toters” 
and “Naughty Johnny”.  Have 
students identify colloquial 
expressions and explain their 
meanings.   
  
Intermediate: Have 
students interview family 
members to gather popular 
colloquial expressions.  Have 
them create a booklet or poster 
in which they can record ten 
colloquial expressions and their 
meanings. 
  
Advanced: After reading short 
stories by local authors, have 
students identify and 
explain the meaning of the 
colloquial expressions found in 
the short story. (see Resources 
Section)

Objective 2.56. Interpret figures of speech in context (similes, metaphors, alliteration, onomatopoeia, hyperbole  
                          and personification).

Good readers recognize when an author 
is using figurative language. A figure of 
speech is a phrase or words that mean 
“something different altogether from what 
is being said”. Knowing how each figure 
of speech works can help a reader see a 
clearer picture of what is being 
described.   
   
Personification gives human qualities to 
non-human things.  Example: The 
computer screen winked at the man 
who pressed its reset button.  
   
When trying to find and interpret 
personification, a reader can ask:  
 Which object is performing the 
action?  
 What human action is the thing doing 
that cannot really happen?  
 What is the author trying to tell me 
about this thing being described?  
  
Hyperbole: This is an exaggeration. It is 
over-emphasizing or stretching the truth 
to make a point to the readers, to be 
dramatic or to add humour. Example:  
Shall I say this for the millionth time?  
Basic: On the Move! Place cards 
that identify the different types of 
figurative language by question 
type or a descriptive sentence in a 
bag. Have students randomly 
choose a card. Assign labelled 
spots around the classroom for 
each figure of speech. Allow 
students to classify their 
descriptions by moving under the 
correct figure of speech. Have 
students take turns reading their 
descriptions aloud and defending 
their choice. Provide corrective 
feedback, as required.  
  
Intermediate: Character Sketch 
Play the movie clip of the song, 
“You’re a Mean One, Mr. 
Grinch”. Supply students with the 
song lyrics and lead them to 
highlight the lines which contain a 
figure of speech. Identify each type 
of speech and use the guiding 
questions to help students interpret 
the meaning of each line that 
describes the mean grinch

When trying to find and interpret a 
hyperbole, a reader can ask:  
 Is this statement literally true?  
 Which part of the statement is being 
exaggerated?  
 Is the author trying to emphasize a 
point or just add humour?   
Alliterations and Onomatopoeia act as 
the sound effects of the text.   
   
Alliterations are created by repeating 
the beginning sound in two or more 
neighbouring words. Example: “The 
clowns can count on me to carefully 
count their funds”, smirked Shantell.   
   
Onomatopoeia refers to words that are 
actual sounds. Example: “Snip, snip, 
snippy, snip”, the scissors teased the 
model as it cut her hair.  
   
When trying to interpret an alliteration 
and onomatopoeia, a reader can ask:  
1. What person, place, thing, or idea is 
being described?  
2. What is the sound effect telling me 
about this ____________?   
3. What does the author want me to 
think or feel about the thing being 
described?  
attitude, behavior, and usual 
relationship with others). Repeat 
more guided practice with other 
songs and short passages 
(Examples: “This Girl is on Fire” by 
Alicia Keys, Disney, and Pixar 
songs)  
  
Advanced: What a Character! 
Have students create and present a 
simple PowerPoint that evaluates a 
fable or folktale character. Ensure 
that:   
   
1. Three qualities of the character 
are presented.   
2. Each conclusion about the 
character’s trait is supported 
with at least two figurative 
phrases quoted from the text.    
3. Each type of figurative language 
is identified and has a page 
reference.   
  
Encourage presenters to use the 
guiding questions to explain their 
interpretation of the quoted 
phrases. Students without access 
to PowerPoint can create a flipbook

Similes and Metaphors make 
comparisons of two unlike things.  
   
Similes are phrases that begin with 
“like” or “as”.  Example: The toddler 
moved with as much grace as a raging 
bull.    
  
However, metaphors are phrases that 
do not use the words “like” or “as”.   
Example: The older twin is the early 
bird, unlike his brother who is a night 
owl.  
  
When trying to interpret a simile or 
metaphor, a reader can ask:  
 
1. What two things are being

A sentence is a group of words 
that express a complete thought. It 
begins with a capital letter and ends 
with a punctuation mark.  It has two 
parts:  a subject and a predicate. 
 
A fragment is a group of words that 
only make up part of a sentence. A 
fragment does not express a 
complete thought or idea. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:   Divide the class into teams 
and have them stand on a line.  
Place a set of sentence strips in 
front of each team with sentences 
and fragments written on them, 
along with two boxes labelled 
‘sentences’ and ‘fragments’.  Have 
students take turns selecting a strip, 
reading it and placing it into the 
correct box.  When done, have 
students tag the next person in line 
and run to the back of the line.  The 
winner is the first team that 
completes the relay with all strips in 
the correct boxes.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A run-on sentence is two or more 
simple sentences not separated by 
correct punctuation and connecting 
words or conjunctions.  A run-on 
sentence does not mean a sentence 
is too long; longer sentences are likely 
to be run-ons only when they contain 
more than one complete idea. 
 
Example of a Run-On Sentence and 
Ways to Correct it: 
 
“Chocolate is a wonderful treat too 
much can cause a sugar rush!” 
 
1. Chocolate is a wonderful treat.    
    Too much can cause a sugar  
     rush! 
 
2. Chocolate is a wonderful treat, but 
    too much can cause a sugar rush! 
 
3. Chocolate is a wonderful treat; too  
    much can cause a sugar rush! 
 
Basic:  Give each group of students a 
set of sentence strips containing run-on 
and properly written sentences. Have 
students read each sentence.  Ask them 
to separate the sentences into two 
groups: “Run-on Sentences” and 
“Correctly Written Sentences”.   
 
Intermediate:  Give small groups of 
students an extremely lengthy run-on 
sentence on a long construction paper.  
Have them read their sentence aloud in 
one breath, then have them read it where 
they think punctuations should be 
inserted.  Next, allow students to use 
scissors to cut the sentence apart and 
edit for correctness.  Remind students to 
add capital letters and punctuation marks 
to show where one sentence ends and 
the new one begins.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Nouns are words that name a person, 
place, animal, thing, or idea. They are 
known as common nouns, when they 
do not name a particular person, place, 
animal, thing, or idea.  
 
Common nouns are capitalized when 
they begin a sentence or are part of a 
title. 
 
Example:   
Person:   police 
Place:      downtown 
Animal:   dog          
Thing:     building 
Idea:        fear 
 
A Proper Noun is the name of a 
particular person, place, or thing.  A 
proper noun begins with a capital letter. 
Days of the week, months of the year 
and holidays are proper nouns. 
 
Example: 
Person:  Stephanie Jones 
Place:     Exuma 
Animal:   Potcake 
Thing:     Ivy L. Dumont Building  
Idea:       Christmas 
Basic:  Have students work in groups 
to find examples of the different types 
of nouns (common, proper) in the 
local newspaper. Have students cut 
them out and tape them under the 
correct heading on a large piece of 
construction paper that is divided into 
sections.   
 
Intermediate:  Arrange students into 
groups. Provide each group with chart 
paper divided into columns and rows.  
Instruct the students to label the 
columns using the words ‘Animals’, 
‘People’, ‘Places’, ‘Ideas’ and ‘Things’.  
Choose a letter and tell the students 
that they have thirty seconds to find a 
noun for each category that begin with 
a specific letter.  Complete several 
rounds using a different letter each 
time. 
 
Advanced:  Have students use a list 
of common and proper nouns to write 
original sentences that include both 
types.  Have them underline the 
nouns and indicate, using ‘C’ or ‘P’ 
whether they are common or proper.   
 
Have students 
complete a worksheet 
where they have to 
identify common and 
proper nouns.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A compound word is made up of two 
or more words. 
shoe + lace = shoelace 
class + room = classroom 
mail + box = mailbox 
 
Compound words can come in various 
forms: 
 
Open form – This means that there is a 
space between the two words. 
Example:  seat belt 
 
Closed form – There is no space 
between the words. 
Example:  grandmother 
 
Hyphenated Form - Some compounds 
have a hyphen between the words. This 
helps to show that the words being 
together have their own special 
meaning. 
Example:  up-to-date - current 
 
When using ‘high’ or ‘low’ before a 
noun, use a hyphen. 
Example:   
A low-grade oil can clog your engine.

Collective nouns name groups of 
objects, people or animals. Some 
collective nouns are flexible and can 
be used to name different groups of

keys is called a “bunch”. A group of 
bananas on a tree is called a “bunch”. 
 
However, some collective nouns are 
specific to naming one kind of thing.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The possessive form of a noun is used to 
show ownership or to describe an attribute.   
 
A singular possessive noun is used to 
show ownership by one person or thing.  
The possessive of a singular noun is 
formed by adding an apostrophe (’) and 
the letter /s/ at the end of the word. 
 
Example:  the pirate’s hat 
 
A plural possessive noun is used to show 
ownership by more than one person or 
thing.  There are two rules for forming a 
plural possessive noun.   
 
1. If the plural noun ends with the  
    letter /s/, add an apostrophe (’) 
   after the /s/.   
   
Example:  The ladies’ suitcases 
 
2. If the plural noun does not end   
    with the letter /s/, add an  
    apostrophe (’) and the letter /s/   
    at the end of the word. 
    
Example:  geese's eggs 
 
Basic:  Have students make 
phrases written on the board show 
possession by adding an 
apostrophe or an apostrophe and 
an /s/. 
 
Intermediate: Have students

A verb is a word that tells what the 
subject of a sentence does, did or will 
do.  A verb can also express the state 
of being.   
 
An action verb is a word that 
expresses action.  
 
Example:  Mr. Burrows skippered the 
‘Whitty K’ during the recent Exuma 
Regatta. 
 
Linking verbs do not express action. 
Instead, they connect the subject of the 
verb to additional information about the 
subject. 
 
Example:  The beach is a peaceful 
place. 
 
The following verbs are true linking 
verbs: These include: am, is, are, was, 
were, seem, become. 
 
The following can be both linking or 
action verbs:  feel, look, grow, appear, 
taste, smell, sound and remain.

(similar to ‘Mother May I’). Students 
will ask their teacher a question using 
vivid verbs to help make the actions

ask them to perform that action verb.  
Example:  Teacher may I skip across 
the classroom? Teacher’s response: 
“Yes, you may!”

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The tense of a verb shows the time 
of an action. There are three main 
tenses: past, present, and future. 
 
The present tense of a verb means 
that the action is taking place now or 
happens regularly. A verb written in 
the present tense needs to agree with 
the subject of the sentence.  
 
Examples:   
The children attend virtual classes. 
The Bible tells us about God’s grace.  
 
The past tense of a verb means that 
the action has happened already. 
Most past tense verbs end with an 
‘ed’.  
 
Example:  My sister answered the 
phone yesterday. 
 
The future tense of a verb means 
that the action has not happened yet, 
but it will happen. This tense is formed 
by using ‘will’ or ‘shall’ with the 
simple form of the verb.  
 
Example:  Next year, Jeff will enter

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Good writing starts with well-written 
sentences. A sentence has two parts: 
the complete subject and 
the complete predicate.  
  
The complete subject of a sentence 
includes the main noun or 
pronoun and the additional words 
that tell who or what the sentence is 
about. The subject is usually found 
at the beginning of the sentence.  
 
Example:  Pirates such as Edward 
Teach stole ships.  
 
He was known as one of the most 
feared pirates. 
 
However, the subject of an imperative 
sentence is often not written in the 
sentence. It is understood that the 
subject is ‘you’. 
 
Example:  Go and wipe that messy 
mirror. 
(You) Go and wipe that messy mirror.

the newly formed sentences aloud. Start 
this activity with declarative sentences only 
and repeat the exercise gradually adding 
the other types of sentences.  
 
Intermediate: Have students either 
compose or copy from a text an example 
of each of the four types of sentences. 
Then, have them trade their sentences

their noun. 
 
Taking turns, challenge each partner to 
elaborate on the topic by adding one word 
to the subject or the predicate. Encourage 
students to add as many details as 
possible to build the complete subject and 
complete predicate without adding another 
sentence. Model the process of expanding 
the sentence for students, if necessary.

An adjective describes a noun or a

The long and winding road stretched 
before us as we left Deadman’s Cay to 
make our way to Cape Santa Maria where 
the powdery sand meets crystal clear 
waters. 
 
Adjectives may be used to compare two 
things that may be the same or different in 
some way.  If they are different, we 
compare them by adding ‘er’ to the end of 
the adjective (comparative). 
 
Example:  A cruise ship is longer than a 
mailboat. 
 
Use the –est form of an adjective to 
compare three or more persons, places, or 
things (superlative).  
The endings ‘er’ and ‘est’ are often used 
to compare adjectives with one syllable.  
Basic:  Have students use a 
thesaurus or dictionary to find 
synonyms for given adjectives that

A prepositional phrase includes the 
preposition, the object, and all the 
words that come between them.  The 
object of the preposition can be a noun 
or pronoun. 
In the sentence – “The old lady’s gaze 
wandered over the other side of the 
Glass Window Bridge,” there are two 
prepositional phrases.     
over the other side  
of the Glass Window Bridge. 
 
Sometimes, words that appear on the 
list of prepositions may not actually 
perform the duty of a preposition in a 
sentence.  They must be followed by an 
object to be considered a preposition. 
 
Example: Frankie went outside.  
   
The word ‘outside’ is an adverb in this 
sentence telling where. 
 
Frankie went outside the classroom 
door.  ‘Outside’ now has the object 
door and can be considered a 
preposition.

Coordinating Conjunctions join 
words, phrases, clauses and 
sentences of equal rank. Some 
coordinating conjunctions are: 
for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so.   
 
Examples: 
 
Joining words 
Is basketball or soccer the greater 
sport? 
 
Joining phrases 
Flamingos can be trained to stand at 
attention and in order. 
 
Joining Sentences 
Grace loves the ocean, but she 
doesn’t know how to swim. 
 
When a conjunction separates two 
sentences, a comma should be 
placed after the first sentence and 
before the conjunction as shown 
above.    
 
When coordinating conjunctions join 
two sentences into one, the 
sentence is called a compound 
Basic:  Provide students with a

A clause has a subject and a verb. 
 
There are parts of a sentence that can 
stand alone, they are referred to as 
independent clauses because they 
make a complete thought. 
 
In the sentence below there is a part of 
it that can stand alone. 
 
Since the teacher had to go to the 
office, the students conducted 
morning devotions. 
 
“The students conducted 
devotions”, makes a complete thought 
and can stand alone.  This is an 
independent clause. 
 
Dependent clauses do not make a 
complete thought.

“Since the teacher had to go to the 
office”, does not make a complete 
thought and is known as a dependent 
clause, because it needs the rest of the 
sentence to make sense.  It cannot 
stand on its own. 
 
The word ‘since’ in the sentence is 
known as a subordinating 
conjunction.  Subordinating 
conjunctions help to join a dependent 
clause to an independent clause. 
 
There are various types of 
subordinating conjunctions:  because, 
since, if, when, until, while, after, as,

When writing, it is important to use a 
variety of sentences in order to keep 
readers interested.   
 
A Simple Sentence has a subject and 
a verb and expresses a complete 
thought.  
 
Simple sentences can be expanded in 
several ways. 
 
1. Combining key information in two or 
more sentences. 
 
Example: 
 Jeff helped his mom to prepare 
a meal.  It was delicious. 
 Jeff helped his mom to 
prepare a delicious meal. 
 
2. Combining words in a series and 
phrases. 
 
Example: 
 She viewed a video on 
YouTube. She viewed a video 
on WhatsApp. 
 She viewed a video on the LMS. 
 
Basic:   Provide students with pairs 
of simple sentences that have 
related information.  Have students 
join the two simple sentences into 
one, by using a coordinating 
conjunction to combine the 
information contained in them.   
 
Intermediate:  Using two spinning 
wheels that contain nouns and 
verbs, have students spin to select 
either one noun and two verbs or 
two verbs and one noun to create 
sentences with compound subjects 
and compound predicates. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students with 
either an independent clause or a 
dependent clause and have them 
add to it in order to make a complex 
sentence.

Interjections are words that express 
sudden or strong emotions. 
 
Interjections are usually used as a 
greeting, an expression of surprise, or 
an expression of anger or pain. 
 
Examples:   
 
hey 
wow 
yay 
shh 
great 
ouch

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Synonyms are words that have the same 
or similar meanings. Synonyms are 
valuable tools for readers and writers as 
they can make writing more interesting and 
enriching. 
 
Examples:   
1. dirty – filthy, unclean  
2. sad – depressed, unhappy 
3. abrupt – quick, sudden 
4. grant – allow, permit 
 
Remember, words may have the same 
dictionary meaning, but certain synonyms 
have strong feelings and images attached. 
These words can impact the audience 
positively or negatively. 
 
For example, the synonyms ‘filthy’ and 
‘unclean’ both describe something that is 
‘dirty’. However, an object that is ‘filthy’ 
seems to be in a worse state than an 
object that is “unclean”. 
 
It is important that good readers and writers 
carefully select the correct synonym to 
invoke the right emotions and images. 
 
Basic:  Using emojis, have 
students write a pair of 
synonym words for each emoji 
shown.

The five steps in the Writing Process 
are:  
 
Prewriting – The writer brainstorms 
ideas about a particular topic and 
organizes thoughts using a web or 
outline. 
 
Writing – The writer follows the 
outline and begins writing, by adding 
details to those ideas in the plan. 
 
Revising – The writer reads the 
essay and shares it with others to get 
their feedback.  The writer adjusts the 
essay based on the feedback and 
focuses on using more vivid 
vocabulary.  
 
Basic:   Have students create 
illustrations that depict their 
perception of each step in the 
writing process.  Have them label 
their drawings with the appropriate 
steps in the process and then 
describe what happens at each 
step to a partner.

Resources 
There are four main types of writing. 
They each serve a different purpose. 
 
1. Narrative Writing – This type of 
writing tells a story.  It is mainly 
written for entertainment. A 
personal narrative tells a story 
about you. 
 
2. Descriptive Writing – Uses 
figurative language and provides 
sensory details about a person, 
place, thing or idea so that a clear 
picture is painted in the reader’s 
mind.  
 
3. Expository Writing – Provides 
information, gives an explanation 
or directions. 
 
4. Persuasive/Opinion Writing - 
This type of writing expresses how 
the writer feels about a particular 
subject and attempts to get others 
to feel the same way. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Provide students with 
examples of writing related to 
travel:  plane ticket/itinerary, 
airline advertisement, safety 
card, travel magazine, flight 
board etc.  Have them classify 
them into a particular type of 
writing and give reasons for their 
choices. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
work in groups to look through 
the newspaper to identify the 
four types of writing.  They 
should provide reasons for their 
choices. 
 
Advanced:  Divide students into 
four groups.  Assign each group 
a type of writing.  Have students 
prepare and debate why a 
particular type of writing is better 
than the others.  Ensure that 
they give good reasons for their 
arguments.

Resources 
Before writing there are several 
prewriting steps to follow: 
 
1. Generate ideas.  Strategies that 
can be utilized to help generate 
ideas include: peer discussions, 
brainstorming, grouping ideas that 
are alike, conducting research in 
textbooks or on the internet, 
talking to people who might be 
knowledgeable about the topic, 
conducting a survey, making a list 
etc. 
 
2. Select the best ideas.  Review 
the ideas and then make a 
selection based on those that are 
most important, most interesting 
and have information that is 
readily available. 
 
3. Refine ideas.  Ask leading 
questions that will give specific 
details on which the writer can 
elaborate:  Who?  What?  When?  
Where?  Why?  How? 
 
Basic: Ask students to create 
a list of famous pirates.  Have 
them select one on which to 
write.  
 
Intermediate:    Have students 
research information on the 
physical appearance of pirates.  
Ask them to select one feature 
on which to write.  Have them 
provide examples. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
brainstorm what they know 
about pirates.  Have them 
group certain ideas that are 
alike.  Ask them to select one 
aspect on which to write.  They 
can add details to their writing 
by asking the 5Ws and 1H 
questions (Who?  What?  
When?  Where?  Why?  
How?) and by including 
examples. 
 
Have students show the 
process that they used to 
narrow their ideas on a 
particular topic.

Sequence is the order in which things 
happen or should happen.  Sequential 
order is very important when one is 
relaying a story, writing directions or 
instructions for performing a particular 
task and describing something. 
 
 Before Words: ‘formerly’ and ‘prior 
to’ 
 
 Words that Show First: ‘initially’ 
and ‘originally’ 
 
 Words that Show Next: ‘shortly 
after’ and ‘a few seconds later’ 
 
 Words that Show Last: ‘to finish’ 
and ‘in conclusion’ 
 
Another way to put ideas in order is to 
use space order particularly when 
describing the location of something. 
Space order tells about something from 
top to bottom or from left to right or 
vice versa.   
 
Prepositions like ‘below’ and ‘beside’ 
relay specific images.

An essay is divided into several 
paragraphs.  A good paragraph has 
a topic sentence that clearly states 
the main idea.  The other sentences 
in the paragraph provide the details 
that support that idea.  
 
Good paragraphs also have 
transitional words and phrases that 
show clear relationships or 
connections between ideas, 
sentences or paragraphs.  There are 
three main types of transitions. They 
are transitions of time, comparison 
and contrast and transitions for 
exemplifying.

up the main idea of the paragraph. 
 
Narrative Writing – When telling a 
story, the topic sentence should 
indicate what the story will be about.  
The supporting details should all 
provide information related to that 
topic. Do not include un-related 
information. 
 
Example:  My birthday party was a 
disaster.  To begin with, all of my 
friends came late.  Then, there were 
no candles for the cake and most 
important of all, no one bought 
presents.  I just want this day to end. 
 
Descriptive Writing – The topic 
sentence should tell what is being 
described.  The supporting details 
should provide vivid descriptions of 
that person, place, thing or animal. 
 
Example:  The beach in Orange 
Creek, Cat Island is gorgeous!  The 
water is crystal clear.  At the right 
tide, white sand dunes can be seen 
poking out of the water.  Among them 
you may find tiny crabs, shells and

Expository Writing:   
If your purpose is to inform your 
reader, your supporting details 
should be facts.   
 
Example:  The crawfish season in 
The Bahamas is from 1st August to 
31st March.  It is important to 
establish a crawfish season for 
several reasons.  First, it allows the 
crawfish time to reproduce and for 
the babies to grow.  Secondly, it 
ensures that we do not consume too 
much crawfish which might cause 
them to become extinct.  Finally, it 
also ensures that some crawfish are 
there to perform their jobs of keeping 
the reefs clean.  If we follow these 
rules, we can enjoy crawfish for a 
long time. 
 
Persuasive Writing:  If the purpose 
is to persuade, then the topic 
sentence should clearly state the 
opinion of the writer on a particular 
topic and then have solid reasons in 
the details to support that viewpoint.

Voice refers to how much of the 
writer can be felt in a piece.  Is the 
writer interested and passionate 
about what is being written?   
 
The work of many famous authors 
can be recognized by their voice 
and writing style.  
 
The writer’s voice comes through in 
the tone and mood of the piece.  
Tone refers to the feeling that an 
author creates.  Is the piece 
serious? Playful? angry? etc.  
 
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the piece.  
Is the reader happy? sad? fearful?  
It is important that the tone matches 
the message that the writer is trying 
to send.  If the subject is serious for 
example, the language should not 
be light or funny.

The viewpoint from which material is written 
affects the voice.  Writing can be done from 
different perspectives.  Be careful when 
writing that you do not move from one 
perspective to another. 
 
First Person – This perspective uses 
pronouns like I, me, my, mine, and myself 
to tell the story.  The story is only being told 
from one person’s perspective.  Because it 
is personal, an easy connection can be 
made with the reader. 
 
Second Person – This viewpoint uses 
pronouns like you and yours.  The story is 
being told by someone who is looking on. 
 
Third Person – He, she, it and they are 
used when writing from this perspective.  
When writing from this viewpoint, the writer 
is the person who is looking on.  Readers 
get to experience the inner thoughts of the 
characters.   
 
Personification – This is when the writing 
is done from the perspective of an animal or 
an object.  This is accomplished by giving 
the animal or object human characteristics 
such as speaking or gesturing. 
Basic: Show students the silent 
commercial from The Guardian 
that shows an incident from three 
different perspectives.  Stop the 
video after the first and second 
perspectives to allow students a 
chance to share what they think is 
happening.  Play the final 
perspective and reflect on how 
their perspectives differed from 
what was really happening.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Writers often use dialogue in their 
narrative pieces to make them more 
interesting.  Quotation marks are 
used to set apart the exact words of 
the speaker from the rest of the 
sentence. One of the quotation marks 
appears at the beginning of what was 
said and the other at the end.  The 
first word in a quote is capitalized. 
 
Example:  
“Should we wait?” I asked. 
 
Commas are used to separate who is 
speaking from what is being said.  
 
Example:   
“Ricky,” she shouted, “Look at that 
lovely specimen on the rock.” 
 
We drank the lemonade slowly, “That 
was refreshing!” Jack exclaimed. 
 
Quotation marks are used to identify 
the title of a song or a piece of writing. 
The first quotation mark goes at the 
beginning of the title and the second 
quotation mark at the end of the title. 
Example:   
Basic: Provide students with a 
grammatically incorrect written 
dialogue.  Have them 
scrutinize the way the 
conversation is presented and 
identify the changes that 
should be made.  This can be 
done as a whole-class activity.

students with a transcript of an 
online chat between two 
friends.  Have students rewrite

“March on Bahamaland” is the name

To increase the impact of their writing, 
writers often use familiar quotes or 
quotes from famous people to get the 
attention of the reader.  These quotes 
are set off by commas.  They begin 
with a capital letter and quite often a 
comma separates them from the rest 
of the sentence.

Narrative writing tells a story or part of a 
story. Narrative writing can be seen in 
short stories, biographies, essays, 
autobiographies, poems, and plays. A 
narrative essay should have an 
introduction, body, and a conclusion. The 
general characteristics of a narrative 
include:  
 Characterization  
 Setting  
 Plot structure   
o Introduction  
o Development  
o Conclusion 
   
Characters are the people or animals in a 
story.  The protagonist is the word used to 
describe the hero. The antagonist is the 
villain in the story. Time should be spent 
developing descriptions of major 
characters.  Use specific words to 
describe some of their unique physical 
characteristics as they relate to their face, 
hair and body.  Also give insight into their 
character traits by detailing their actions 
and using interesting words. 
 
Examples:  
 Brave – bold, valiant 
Basic: Provide student with pictures of 
famous pirates. Have them brainstorm 
and write ideas about what is going on 
in the picture. Students should then 
write a story based on that picture, 
making sure that they sequence their 
ideas appropriately. Special attention 
should be given to describing the 
setting, describing the characters in the 
story and developing the plot. 
  
Intermediate: Provide students with 
information about the history of the 
Lucayans. Have them research the 
history and cultural significance of the 
Lucayans in The Bahamas and create 
their own historical narratives. 
  
Advanced: Have students develop 
interview questions they would ask an 
elderly person about his/her life.  Have 
them interview someone aged 65 or 
older and write a narrative using that 
person's voice. Special attention should 
be given to describing the setting of 
various events, describing the 
characters in the story and developing 
the plot in a seamless way. 
 
Have students 
compose a 
narrative, inclusive 
of story elements, 
following a 
standardized 
prompt.  Use a 
rubric to evaluate 
their essay.

The setting is the time and place where 
the story takes place.  Use the senses to 
tell what can be seen, heard, felt, tasted, 
or smelled.   
 
Provide evidence of the time of day.  This 
can be stated clearly in the piece.  
Example:  It was exactly 9:00 a.m. when 
she opened the door to the office.   
 
It can also be left up to the reader to infer 
the time of day.  
Example:  The sun was directly overhead 
as they began their walk to the sandy 
beach.  
  
In the body of the writing, time should be 
taken to develop the plot.  The plot tells 
what the problem in the story is and how it 
is resolved.  This is the time to use action 
and dialogue to provide information about 
the characters. Sentences should be 
linked using transitions.  
  
The end of the story or conclusion wraps

A descriptive essay is a group of 
paragraphs that can describe a person, 
place, event, or idea.  The author uses 
descriptive details, phrasing, and literary 
devices to make the writing come alive 
and make it easier for the reader to 
visualize what the writer is describing.   
 
A descriptive essay should have a 
captivating introduction that provides the 
reader with an overview of what the 
essay will be about.  The body of the 
essay should provide specific details 
about what is being described.  The 
writer should end with a concluding 
thought about the thing, place or person 
that was described.    
 
There are several strategies that authors 
use when writing descriptively.  The 
words that are used to describe, should 
be carefully selected so that they convey 
detailed images to the readers. 
 
 Show Me, Don’t Tell Me is a strategy

 Sensory details are words used to 
appeal to the five senses.  
 
Example:  As I passed Mr. Sawyer’s 
house, there they were…  the 
biggest, sweetest, darkest, purple 
sea grapes in the world!  They hung 
in long, heavy clusters just over the 
wooden fence.  Like a magnet, I was 
drawn to them.  As I got closer to the 
tree, I stepped on a few that had 
fallen to the ground.  A dark, purple 
liquid oozed out of them causing a 
strong, fruity scent to fill the air. 
 
 Literary Devices are also used as a 
tool for making writing interesting.  
There are several of them that can be 
used. 
 
o Similes are comparisons that use 
like or as. Example:  He ran as 
Bahamas. Have student groups 
compose a script for a commercial of 
at least two paragraphs, to entice 
visitors to come to The Bahamas. 
Students can create a video or 
perform their commercial in class. 
Peers can provide feedback. 
 
Have students listen to radio 
advertisements and their jingles 
(B.O.B, Wendy’s, Domino’s Pizza 
etc.) Have students discuss their use 
of descriptive details and use of 
literary devices.  Have student 
groups compose a jingle for a radio 
advertisement of at least two verses, 
to appeal to the listening audience. 
Students can create a video or

The Body of the Essay: This is where 
the writer develops the reasons to 
support his/her opinions.  Each 
paragraph in the body should represent 
one of those reasons with supporting 
evidence.    
 
Writers normally present their reasons 
in order of importance.  They begin 
with the most important reason to 
support their opinion and then present 
the others in descending order.  
Several persuasive techniques can be 
used to develop the body of the 
persuasive essay. 
 
Using Facts: Using information that is 
true to strengthen your position and 
explanations.  
 
Example: 
“Earth is considered the most valuable 
planet in the solar system. Billions of 
people live on Earth using its resources 
like oxygen, water and food sources. 
Therefore, I agree...”

Superlatives: Using phrases to 
describe the highest quality of 
something. 
Example:  'the greatest’, ‘the most’, ‘the 
best’ etc.  
 
Data: Writing with numbers, 
percentages, fractions, and quantities 
to make your explanations appear 
more believable. 
Example:    
Do you know that New Providence 
uses 11 million gallons of ground water 
per day?

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL  
ORAL PRESENTATION RUBRIC 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the oral presentation skills of students in Grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors 
are so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: content and delivery. This gives flexibility of use, as teachers and students can decide whether to focus on one aspect 
of an oral presentation or both sections.

USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEACHING OF READING 
 
 
THE READING PROCESS  
 
The reading process aims to provide readers with a systematic framework to monitor and guide their thinking, understanding, 
and response to a text. The overarching goal is for learners to eventually apply this process with automaticity inside and outside 
the classroom environment. However, to achieve this goal, readers must have multiple opportunities to observe this process 
being effectively applied to various texts and be allowed to use this method with guided support.  
 
The following Guide Steps for The Reading Process can be placed on individual bookmarks or posted on a classroom chart 
for ease of reference by students. 
 
BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
 Scan the Text. Ask yourself: 
o Is this text fiction or non-fiction?  
o Scan the cover, title, chapter 
headings, and pictures of a 
fictional text. 
o Scan the headings, bold print, 
and illustrations of a non-fictional 
text. 
o Skim read a few of the words. 
 
 
Think about what you know already 
about this topic.*  
 
 
Make predictions about what the 
 Read the text in chunks.  
 
 Stop and check if you understood 
what was read. Ask yourself: 
o What has happened so far? What 
important information was given 
already? 
o How am I feeling about what I am 
reading? 
o Do I need to re-read any 
confusing parts? 
o Can I see a clear picture in my 
mind of what is being shared? 
o Are the illustrations helping me to 
 Summarize and reflect on the main 
ideas of what you read. Ask yourself: 
o Did I learn any new information or 
ideas? 
o Do I have any burning questions 
left unanswered about this topic? 
 
 Connect it to your real life. Ask 
yourself: 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something else I read? 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something I have experienced 
before?

BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
text may be about.  
 
 
Think about what you may learn, 
feel, or encounter in this text. 
 
understand what I am reading? 
o Were my predictions correct? If 
not, what is my new prediction? 
 
 Figure out only important unknown 
words. Ask yourself: 
 Are there any context clues or 
word parts to help figure out the 
meaning?    
 Evaluate what you read. Ask 
yourself: 
o Did I agree or disagree with these 
ideas? 
o Have I changed my mind or 
feelings about this topic? 
 
 
*NOTE: Pay careful attention to the student’s responses here and determine if the reader has sufficient background 
knowledge about the topic to understand what is about to be read. If it seems that the reader does not, pause here and 
provide learning experiences to build knowledge before reading.  
 
 
BASAL READERS 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-levelled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate 
reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension 
skills, and vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journeys 


265 
 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
THE LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE APPROACH 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the 
board or chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the Language Arts 
components (speaking, listening, writing, and reading) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teacher’s observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read 
orally. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps 
the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 


266 
 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading focuses on developing readers’ ability to independently apply both strategies and skills in context. Readers are 
arranged in groups of four to six based on their instructional reading level and provided more targeted reading instruction and 
support. The instructional sessions are focused on the students’ use of multiple strategies or skills in context.  
 
BASIC ROUTINE FOR USING GUIDED-READING INSTRUCTION 
1. 
Conduct a diagnostic assessment of readers. 
5. Provide direct instruction or coaching on a specific 
strategy or skill. 
2. 
Group students according to their reading levels. 
6. Offer meaningful activities to the rest of the class while 
engaged with a group. 
3. 
Select a variety of texts at the instructional level for each 
group. 
7. Conduct ongoing reading-level assessments to track 
progress. 
4. 
Allow students during group sessions to read the entire 
text or sections. 
8. Provide individual or peer-led instruction to students who 
require further instruction. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings about the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The pupil encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in social studies, 


267 
 
science and arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialised the subject matter becomes, the more demand for 
reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides for both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  A lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ abilities and interests, and be ready to help students find the right books at the 
right time.  Learning students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can 
be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage 
students to visit their school libraries. 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least a 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate.

SAMPLE READING ENRICHMENT DAY MENU 
 
The Power of Choice! People are naturally more motivated to participate in an activity when given individual choice, and 
learning strategies are built on this tendency. They are flexible enough to be used with any content, ability, or grade level. Here 
is a sample of a Reading Learning Menu that can be used on Enrichment Day. Students are to complete all activities from the 
‘Must Do’ category and choose reading activities from The ‘Can Do’ category according to their preference. 
 
MUST DO 
CAN DO 
In a nutshell 
 
Read a literary piece. 
Write a 10-word summary 
of the pages (or book) you 
have just read. 
Perfect Prediction 
 
Start a new book. Before 
you begin, make three 
predictions based on the 
front cover. 
Setting 
 
Draw a picture of the setting 
of a book you read.

As you read, underline the 
nouns, circle the adjectives, 
and highlight the action 
verbs. 
Vlog

make a video, giving a 
summary of the book. Be 
prepared to share your 
video with the class.

recording on television or 
the news, and then write 
five sentences about what 
you understood and heard. 
Illustrator

DAILY ROUTINE FOR VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION 
 
Vocabulary is the gateway to comprehension, and greater word knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding of a text. While 
this is true, it is impossible to teach the meaning of every word to students. Therefore, vocabulary instruction in the classroom 
should be reserved for words that would have the greatest impact on the comprehension of a text. When learning the meaning 
of an unknown word, the definition is only the first step. Students must have multiple opportunities to engage with the word and 
be able to use it in different forms and contexts. Below is a basic 5–10-minute daily routine for vocabulary instruction for 
unknown words:

DISCUSSION / 
PRESENTATION 
Give direct instruction 
on the meaning of the 
word. Provide 
descriptions, 
illustrations, and 
examples of the word 
usage in everyday life. 
 
Allow students to use 
pictures, words, or body 
movements to 
represent its meaning, 
description, 
explanation, or 
example. Encourage 
creativity. 
Provide vocabulary 
activities to deepen the 
experience (examples / 
non-examples, 
analogies, related 
words, word parts, 
compare and contrast 
meanings with other 
words, etc.). 
Play vocabulary games 
with the focused words 
and other familiar 
words. 
Have students present 
their understanding of 
the word and its usage 
to a partner or another 
audience. Encourage 
creativity. 
NEXT STEP: The new vocabulary can now be added to the classroom word wall or the students’ personalized spelling log. Be 
sure to continuously revise these words in a fun way!

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL: HANDWRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRIC 
OVERALL LEGIBILITY 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the legibility of students’ writing in grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors are so 
detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two sections: 
letter formation and presentation. This gives the flexibility of use, as teachers and students can focus on one aspect of their 
handwriting or both sections during assessments.
