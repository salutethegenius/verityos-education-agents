PREFACE 
 
 
Several strategies were employed to assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum.  The process began 
with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions. These countries included Jamaica, the 
United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois), Canada, and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 guides). The 
documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their rationale and 
philosophy, the level of integration of Sub-Goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as well as the Scope 
of Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa and several other 
countries were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of English and the Ministry of 
Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.  
 
Opportunities were provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers throughout The 
Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted to be included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen (116) teachers 
throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students to get their feedback about 
what they wanted to learn and the types of learning activities they enjoyed.  Additionally, a focus group was conducted with 
members of the community that included business owners, parents, and those who interact with students in after-school clubs 
and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary school teachers, one preschool teacher, and a high school teacher.  Additionally, representatives 
from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment Section provided feedback.  
Opportunities were also provided for several Family Island teachers to submit content and activities through the Education 
Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time engaged in 
research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction to meet the needs of their students.

BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. the learning environment should be student-centred; 
2. at each grade level, students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. all students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason, and make decisions as well as develop self-confidence 
and greater freedom of expression; 
5. all students should acquire essential survival skills, enabling them to function well in society; 
6. technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. the methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. thinking, speaking, listening, reading, and writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme and 
should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms, which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing sixth 
grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our students 
receive at the primary level lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that students can 
take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on communication skills.  During this period in our history, knowledge of basic communication skills is 
essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalisation of everyday services.  More and more people are being 
pushed to use online services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct banking transactions, to pay bills, 
to make travel arrangements, to access government services, and so much more.   Additionally, changes in technology 
demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Landlines, that only required listening and speaking 
skills, have been replaced with smartphones and computers that allow us to communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, 
send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the internet, buy tickets, post to social media, create blogs, conduct and 
participate in meetings from anywhere in the world, and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of 
communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be confidence that our education system will prepare students 
to communicate effectively, despite the changes that occur.  Recognizing that Language Arts skills are the foundation of all 
learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on producing students who are not 
only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability to communicate effectively in a rapidly 
advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves creatively, collaborate, and problem solve as 
we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Goal 4, which speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education 
for all…”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of Oracy, Reading, and Writing, teachers will have in their hands the 
tools to equip students with the fundamental skills that they will need to become lifelong learners and to navigate successfully in 
an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM 
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardisation, teachers 
should familiarise themselves with its contents and should refer to it often, as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area subjects 
and have students apply these skills authentically in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and senses 
are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual field trips, exposure to a 
wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, interactive learning 
centres, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level to provide teachers and parents with a guide for what 
students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This information should be used 
to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also indicates the level of 
proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become proficient in a particular area, teachers 
should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted to make them 
developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the end of the course of study.  
Teachers should be guided by the content, which indicates what students should know or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three Sub-Goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading (Phonemic 
Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar, and Written 
Composition). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds on the 
previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided into three 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 25 
 
categories:  basic, intermediate, and advanced.  Depending on the level of students, teachers can access content and 
activities at their grade levels or other grade levels, as they find it necessary.  
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  Teachers 
are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines, as well as to integrate them into 
the other Language Arts Sub-Goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of opportunities should be provided for 
students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with various audiences.  They should engage in 
collaborative conversations with partners in small and large group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS, and other virtual platforms 
make it possible for conversations and collaborative projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, 
islands, and other countries once the necessary safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with students.  
Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the Sub-Goals.  To avoid duplication in the 
curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best applied.  It is expected that 
once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the strands and that they can be assessed 
across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This particularly refers to 
reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be highlighted.  Students are to be exposed 
to different types of literature and the various Language Arts skills should be taught through teacher read-alouds and 
independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade level. 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales, and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics, and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels, and Science Fiction 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, during 
reading, and after reading. 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 26 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening 
        Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in reading still have opportunities to 
understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (using pictures, video clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, 
short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions as students connect skills to their everyday 
experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing if 
students have mastered the skill is to have them incorporate it into a writing exercise.  This will allow them to apply what 
they have learned.  Students who can apply reading skills would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy.  
Following this method of teaching comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into 
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the sitting of 
the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling, and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as ends in 
themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting; 
however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in the case of Grammar, 
where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should only be scored for what has 
been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week, the number of items on the checklist should 
increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the checklist should be continually reinforced.  
By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been generated.  Students should be aware of what is 
contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to assess their writing before it is even submitted for marking.  
Students’ writing should be marked for content, mechanics, and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: Grade One 
students should begin writing utilising three lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations 
are correct. During the third term of grade two, cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected 
that cursive handwriting will be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, and 
words from the grade-level word list included in the appendices of this document.

Sub-Goal 1:  Engage effectively in listening and speaking situations for different purposes, audiences, and 
communicate using a variety of media. 
 
LISTENING AND SPEAKING 
 
Objective 1.1 Display the characteristics of a good listener.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A good listener is someone who 
engages in active listening. Good 
listeners strive to understand the total 
meaning of a communicated 
message.   
  
During informal settings, a good 
listener:    
 maintains eye contact;  
 shows empathy;  
 respects the opinions of others;  
 repeats key information, when 
appropriate, to convey 
understanding;  
 uses non-verbal communication 
(nod of head etc.) to show that 
he/she is listening; and  
 asks questions at the appropriate 
times.  
Basic:  Have students watch a 
clip from the Parliamentary 
Channel of the House in Session.  
Ask them to identify those 
members who are exhibiting good 
listening habits.  Have them 
explain the characteristic(s) that 
are being displayed.  (Any 
appropriate clip that shows an 
audience listening to a speaker 
may be used.) 
 
Intermediate:  Have students role 
play situations where listening is 
critical (doctor/patient, 
friend/friend, principal/student 
etc.) Have them demonstrate 
good listening skills. 
 
 
As a whole-group, 
challenge students to 
create a Listening 
Rubric. Then, have 
students assess 
themselves on how 
well they listened.

 During formal settings, a good 
listener:    
  
 maintains appropriate posture (sits 
or stands upright.);  
 looks at the person who is 
speaking;  
 listens/observes for clues (both 
verbal and non-verbal) that would 
assist in making the message 
clearer;  
 respects the opinions of others;  
 provides non-verbal cues to let the 
speaker know that he/she is 
listening, making notes etc.   
 asks questions or comments about 
what is being said at the 
appropriate times.  
 
 
 
 
Advanced:  Invite a guest 
speaker to talk about subject-
related content.  Have students 
display characteristics of good 
listening.  Give them feedback on 
their listening behaviour.

Resources 
Standard English is a term applied to 
language that is grammatically correct. It 
encompasses grammar, vocabulary, 
pronunciation, and spelling. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can get in 
the way of good communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class or with 
a more formal audience. Other occasions 
could be when conducting a class 
assembly, participating in a Christmas play 
etc. 
 
The Bahamian Dialect can be used when 
speaking in more informal settings like with 
family or friends.  It has its own special 
vocabulary and pronunciation. It includes 
words like: 
 
 
 bin = been 
 een = am not 
 tanks = thanks  
 dun = done 
 
 
In addition to being used in informal 
conversations, the Bahamian dialect is 
often featured in Bahamian songs, 
commercials, plays, and novels. 
 
Basic:  Have students create a 
rap about the proper use of 
dialect.  Have them give examples 
in the lyrics. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
listen to parts of a Bahamian play 
in dialect.  Have students translate 
parts of it into Standard English 
for a non-Bahamian audience. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
research online Bahamian dialect 
phrases or common sayings.  
Compare them with the dialect 
and common phrases from 
another Caribbean country like 
Jamaica or Barbados. Ask: 
 
1. How are they similar?   
2. How are they different?  
3. Are there similar occasions 
when they are used?

desks. Present 
students with 
various scenarios.  
Have them move to 
the left side of the 
desk if Standard 
English is the more 
appropriate option 
or move to the right 
if the dialect would 
be more 
appropriate.

Pitch refers to how high or how low 
the person is speaking.  Some 
people normally may have high-
pitched voices, others may have 
low-pitched voices.  When 
completing dramatic activities, the 
speaker may vary the pitch 
depending on who is speaking.

Resources 
A syllable is a unit of 
pronunciation. It is a word or part 
of a word with a single vowel 
sound. The number of syllables in a 
word is determined by the number 
of vowel sounds. Words can be 
divided into syllables.  
  
Syllabication helps in:   
a. Decoding words  
b. Reading fluently   
c. Spelling words accurately   
d. Dividing words at the end of 
    a line when writing   
 
Example: in the word murmur, it 
would be mur-mur and not mu-
rmur or murmu-r.  
 
 
Basic:  After presenting each 
syllabication rule, have students 
take turns dividing the words into 
syllables.   
 
Technology Adaptation:  
Use a gamification platform such 
as Quizizz, Blooket, and Quizlet to 
formatively assess students 
through an engaging activity.  
  
Intermediate:  Play the 
“Concentration Category” game. 
Set the categories to two syllable 
words, words with prefixes, 
suffixes, or ‘r’-controlled syllables.  
Students must produce a word 
that falls in a particular category 
and then divide it into syllables.

A consonant blend, also referred to  
as a ‘consonant cluster’, is when two  
or more consonants come together in 
a word. Each consonant keeps its sound 
when blended. 
 
There are four main basic forms of initial, 
medial, and or final consonant blends 
which are: ‘r’-blends, ‘s’-blends,            
‘l’-blends, and ‘n’-blends. These blends 
may appear at the beginning, middle or 
end of words. 
 
Sample Words:   
assignment 
recommend 
drowsy 
slipped 
dramatic 
swindle 
ministerial 
swivel 
presidential 
treasure 
 
Some blends contain three consonants.  
Common three consonant blends include:  
 
str, spl, shr, thr, scr and spr.  
str words:  strangle, strength, strawberry  
spl words:  splurge, splinter, spleen  
shr words:  shrivel, shrugged, shredded  
thr words:   throne, thrush, thrilling  
spr words:  spruce, sprite, sprawl  
Basic: Word Building Build 
unfamiliar words with letter tiles. 
Have the students identify the 
consonant blend in each word 
and state whether the word 
has an initial, middle, or final 
blend. Have students go back to 
the beginning of the word and 
allow students to decode the 
word.   
  
Intermediate:  Word Search 
and Say:  Create a word search 
containing consonant blend 
words that have not been 
introduced to the students. Have 
students find and highlight as 
many words as they can. Then, 
allow the students to decode 
each word out loud.   
 
Advanced:  Display a bag with 
objects containing various 
blends. Without looking, have 
students pull an object out of the 
bag.  Have them say what the 
object is and identify the blend in 
the word. Have the students 
Using any online 
platform such

blends to decode 
unfamiliar words 
displayed. (Students

Digraphs are two or more consonants 
that appear together in a word but 
stand for only one sound.   
  
Consonant digraphs are:  
/ch/ as in chaos;   
/sh/ shyster;   
/zh/ as in amnesia  
/th/ as in therapeutic (voiceless)  
/th/ as in thoroughly (voiced)

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
When the consonant ‘r’ comes after a 
vowel it sometimes changes the vowel 
sound.  The letter ‘r’ makes the vowel 
have a sound that is different from the 
usual short or long sound.  This 
special sound is considered ‘r-
controlled’.   
 
Sometimes the letters ‘ear’ can make 
the /ɪə/ sound as in ‘years’, 
‘earrings’, and ‘appeared’.   
 
Sometimes the letters ‘ear’ can make 
the /ur/ sound as in ‘earth’, ‘earnest’, 
and ‘earning’.    
   
The /eə/ sound can be spelled ‘air’ as 
in ‘stairway’ and ‘are’ as in ‘barely’.    
  
Sample Words  
 
appeared 
millionaire 
barely 
questionnaire

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A trigraph is a group of three letters 
that together form a single specific 
sound.  
 
The letter combination ‘dge’ is 
a trigraph because the three letters 
always function together to form the 
same sound as the letter ‘j’. 
  
When the /j/ sound is heard at the end 
of a syllable and it is immediately 
preceded by a short vowel, it is spelt -
dge.  
 
Example:   budget, fidget  
 
‘dge’ will never come at the beginning 
of a word. It can be in the middle or 
end of a word. 
  
If the /j/ sound is immediately 
preceded by a long vowel, r-
controlled vowel or consonants, 
the /j/ sound is spelt ‘ge’.  
 
Example:  page, gorgeous 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
and sing the rap about the ‘dge’ 
and ‘ge sounds.  Create a set of 
unfamiliar words that contain ‘dge’ 
and ‘ge’. Have students listen to 
the vowel sound to determine 
whether it will be spelt ‘dge’ or 
‘ge’.  
  
Intermediate: Create a list of 
unfamiliar words containing the 
‘dge’ spelling and provide each 
student with the list.  
Have students do the following: 
 Circle every misspelt word in 
the list.   
 Write the misspelt word

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Diphthongs are types of vowels where 
two vowel sounds are connected in a 
continuous, gliding motion (to make one  
sound). They are often referred to as 
gliding vowels.  
 
Examples of diphthongs are:  
 /oi/, /oy/, /ow/, /ou/  
 
The diphthongs /ou/ and /ow/ can  
have two distinct sounds.   
 /ou/ can sound like ou as in house, 
and like ou as in sprout.  
 ow as in powerful, and ow 
 as in bellow.  
 
Sample Words:   
counterfoils          exploitation   
mountainous       announcement  
flounder               plough  
hallow                  sparrow  
crowning              prowling  
buoyancy            annoyance   
  
If two vowels are beside each other in a 
word or syllable, the first vowel is 
usually long while the second vowel 
remains silent. This is called 
a vowel digraph.  
 
Basic:  Provide students 
with a sheet that has 
columns for each diphthong. 
Give them a list of words that 
have diphthongs.  Have 
students categorise a list of 
words according 
to the diphthong in each 
word.  Have students add 
two additional words of their 
own to each column.  
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students complete a 
crossword puzzle using 
words with diphthongs and 
vowel digraphs.   
  
Advanced: Have students 
write a poem about a 
content- related subject that 
contains diphthongs and 
digraphs.  
 
Have students read 
words in context that 
have the diphthongs and 
vowel digraphs.  Have

diphthongs and vowel 
diagraphs.

In most words, the vowel ‘i’ comes 
 before ‘e’, except after the consonant 
 ‘c’ as in ‘receive’.  
   
Vowel digraph ‘ei’ can spell the  
long a sound, as in ‘veil’.

sound.  
       Example:  wrong 
 
 The letters tch make the /ch/ 
sound.  
       Example:  twitch 
  
 The letters gh are silent in some 
words after ‘au’ and ‘ou’. They 
make the /f/ sound. 
     Examples:  laugh, cough 
 
 The letters wh make the /w/ 
sound. 
      Example:  whether

Alphabetical order refers to the 
organizing of a list of words in the 
order of the alphabet, based on the 
letters in their names. This makes 
information easier to find in a 
dictionary, thesaurus, phone book, 
index, filing system etc.  
  
There are specific rules as to how 
words are organized in alphabetical 
order.  
  
Arrange words in order using their 
first letters.  If the first letters are the 
same, then use the second letters to 
determine the order in which the words 
should appear.  If those are the same, 
then move to third, fourth, fifth letters 
etc.  
 
Examples: appendage, appendix, 
appetite  
  
Numbers are alphabetized 
according to their number order. 
The Arabic numbers are followed by 
Roman Numerals. Also, numbers are 
placed in the order they would be if

A dictionary contains a list of words 
arranged alphabetically.  The meaning 
of each word is explained, and other 
important information is provided.    
 
Guide words - These words are at the 
top of the page in a dictionary or

words found on that page.  
  
Etymology is the history or origin of a 
word. It often appears in brackets at the 
end of the definition.  
  
Entry Word - This shows how the word 
is spelt. The entry word has dots to 
divide the word into syllables.  
  
Pronunciation - Pronunciations are 
found in a bracket immediately after the 
spelling of the word. Its phonetic 
respelling is given. Accent marks show 
where a word has primary (*) and 
secondary (‘) stress. In some cases, 
the vowel in an unstressed syllable can

Resources 
Contractions can be made by 
shortening a word or a pair of words 
by omitting certain letters or sounds.  
An apostrophe is used to indicate 
missing letters or words.   
  
Contractions can be used when 
writing informally.  Words should be 
written fully when writing formally.   
  
Pronoun and Verb Contractions:  
I’d - I would

Basic:  Contraction Match Up 
Have students match the 
contraction cards to the words they 
comprise of.  Select four of the 
words and have students compose 
sentences. 
  
Intermediate:  Play a game of 
Sparkle in which a contraction is 
identified for students to spell.  
Have students stand.  Each student 
calls a letter of the contraction until 
the entire word is spelt. The

An abbreviation is a shortened form 
of a word that ends with a period.   
  
In abbreviations you will notice that:   
  
1.  Most are spelled with the first  
letters of the word.   
Example:  Avenue – Ave. 
 
2.  Some are spelt with a combination 
of letters from the word.   
     Example:  continued – cont’d. 
  
3.  Others are spelled with letters not  
found in the current word.  
     Example:  pound – lb (from the 
     original Latin ‘libra’) 
 
4.  Many abbreviations begin with a  
capital letter.  
Example:  Mister – Mr. 
 
5.  Some abbreviations that include 
unit of measurements or capital 
letters do not need a period.  
Example: Celsius - C

Resources 
Words often contain base words.  A base 
word is the part of a word that can stand 
alone and has meaning.  It is the 
simplest form of the word. 
 
Example: ‘Legal’ is a base word that 
means ‘permitted by law’.  
   
Prefixes and Suffixes can be added to 
base words to change the meanings of 
these words.  
  
Prefix – A prefix is a word or syllable that 
is added at the beginning of a base 
word.    
  
Prefixes have their own special 
meanings too. Example:  The 
prefix ‘il’ means ‘not’.  
  
The word ‘illegal’ means ‘not permitted 
by law’. 
  
A hyphen may sometimes be placed 
between the prefix and base word.  This 
is done in several instances.  
 
 
 
Basic:  Provide students with a 
list of words.  Have them use the 
rules related to hyphens to identify 
the words to which hyphens 
should be added.  
  
Intermediate:  Categorise 
suffixes into groups.  Have 
students search for other related 
words.  For example, -
ist refers to a focused area of 
study.  Have students find words 
that relate: chemist, biologist, 
psychiatrist, botanist etc.  Have 
them share their words with the 
class.  
 
Advanced:   Have students use 
the meanings of prefixes, base 
words, and suffixes to determine 
the meanings of unfamiliar words.

a paragraph.  Ask 
them to identify base 
words that contain 
prefixes or suffixes.  
Have them write the

word and its new 
meaning based on 
the prefix or suffix 
that was added.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
An inflectional ending is a word part 
that is added to a base word.  This 
ending can make a word plural, 
change word tense, or help to make 
comparisons.   Some inflectional 
endings are: ‘s’, ‘es’, ‘ing’, ‘ed’, ‘er’ 
and ‘est’. 
 
1. Adding ‘er’ and ‘est’  
  
If the word ends in a ‘consonant’ and 
‘y’, change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’.  
Example:  pretty - prettiest 
  
If the word ends in ‘consonant’ and 
‘e’, remove the ‘e’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’.  
Example:  fine - finest 
  
If the word ends in a ‘consonant, 
vowel, consonant’, double the last 
letter and add ‘er’ or ‘est’.  
Example:  slim - slimmer 
  
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students make a list of 
as many words with the ‘ing’ ending 
that they could think of in two 
minutes.  The student with the most 
correctly spelt words may win a 
prize.  Do the same with the other 
endings. Students can then categorize 
words according to their inflectional 
ending.  
  
Intermediate: Set up a television 
game show. Have students name that 
ending. Each contestant chooses an 
item from a category. Each item is 
worth a sum of money. When the 
sentence or phrase is read that the 
student chooses, they must indicate 
which word in the sentence has an 
inflectional ending.  Additionally, they 
must spell the entire word.   The 
contestant with the most money is the 
winner.  
 
Advanced:  Have students research 
an era in Bahamian History and write 
a brief account. They should use as 
many words that end with inflectional 
endings as possible.  
 
Have the students 
complete sentences 
by adding inflectional 
endings to base 
words.

2. Adding ‘ed’ and ‘ing’ rules:  
  
If the base word ends in ‘consonant, 
vowel, consonant’ and a stressed 
syllable, double the final consonant 
and add ‘ing’ or ‘ed’.  
Example:  slip – slipping, slipped 
 
If the base verb ends in a ‘consonant’ 
and ‘e’, remove the ‘e’ and add ‘ing’ or 
‘ed’.  
Example:  bottle – bottling/bottled 
  
If the base verb ends in ‘ie’, change 
the ‘ie’ to ‘y’ and add ‘ing’.  
Example:  lie – lying

Objective 2.32 Distinguish between the British and American spellings of commonly used words. 
 
Content

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The two main spellings we use in The 
Bahamas are British English and 
American English. It is important to 
distinguish between the two because 
of the spelling and pronunciation 
differences.  
  
British English keeps the spelling of 
words it has used from other 
languages, mainly French and 
German.  
  
American English spellings are 
based mostly on how the word 
sounds when it is spoken.  
  
Some spelling differences can be 
found at the end of words or the 
spelling changes completely.   
  
When writing, do not switch between 
the British and American spelling. Be 
consistent with the spelling you 
choose.  
  
The table on the next page shows the 
different types of endings that are 
common to both languages. 
Basic: Provide students with a list 
of words that are of American and 
British origin.  Using the cooperative 
groups in your class, have students 
place the words in the correct 
category (British or American) by 
looking at their endings. 
   
Intermediate:  Have students 
identify grocery items that may be 
British or American based on their 
spelling and other information. 
 
Alternate Activity: Dictionary 
Detective Place students in groups, 
give each group a list or words and 
instruct them to indicate the part of 
speech of the word, its origin, 
definition and then write a sentence 
using the word. 
 
Advanced: Have students watch 
clips from an American news show 
and a British news show.  Have 
them observe differences.  Have 
them make note of any words that 
were different, that were used to 
name the same things. Also have 
them indicate spelling differences. 
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet.

Not all the words spoken in English 
are English words.  Their roots were 
formed in another language. Being 
able to recognize certain roots can 
assist with spelling and 
understanding what particular words 
mean.  Recognizing roots can also 
help to see connections between 
words.  
  
Latin  
Latin has a major influence on words 
used in English.  It can often be 
found in words related to science, 
religion, and education.  Knowing 
the meaning of the root words can 
assist with understanding the 
meaning of the whole word.  
  
 In some Latin words, the /k/ is 
represented by a ‘c’.   
Example: canine and collaborate  
 
 The /ü/ sound as in ‘cool’ is 
spelled with a ‘u’ when followed 
by a ‘d’, ‘j’, ‘l’, ‘r’ or ‘s’.             
Example:  frugal and persecute  
 
Basic: Give students a root word 
from a Science or Social Studies 
lesson. Give them the meaning of 
the root and the language from 
which it comes. Have them work in 
groups to create webs of related 
words on charts. Encourage them to 
use dictionaries and textbooks as 
resources. Charts may be 
displayed in the classroom.   
  
Intermediate: Have students plan a 
meal using an Italian dish.  Have 
students compile a shopping list 
of all the ingredients they will 
need.  Give students an 
informal spelling test on these 
words.  
  
 
Advanced:  Have students review 
the spelling rules related to a specific 
language.  Present them with 
unfamiliar words that follow that 
same pattern.  Have them use the 
rules to spell the words.  
 
 
 
Create a Learning 
Game In groups of 
three, challenge 
students to create a 
simple game that 
helps fifth-grade 
students practice 
matching common 
Latin, Greek, and 
Italian roots to their 
meanings. The game 
must include the 3 
types of languages, 
sample words, clear 
rules, game pieces, 
and the answer key. 
Allow students to test 
their game on 
classmates and 
make changes based 
on feedback. 
Students can then 
ask fifth-grade 
students to play.

It is important when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at which 
you are reading, the rise and fall of your 
voice and expression.  
  
Rate – Refers to how fast or how slowly 
one speaks.  Be careful not to speak so 
slowly that listeners lose interest. Do 
not read too quickly, otherwise the 
words may not be clear and the 
listeners may find it difficult to follow.  
  
Breathing can indicate the rate or pace. 
If someone is running or crying, use 
quick short breaths between the words.  
If someone is relaxed, this can be 
portrayed by breathing out slowly.  
  
Intonation – The rise and fall of the 
voice to reflect what is happening in the 
reading piece.  
 
Intonation can communicate up to 70% 
of the meaning of a sentence. Read 
the same sentence below, but each 
time, only place emphasis on the bold 
word to show the influence of 
intonation. 
Basic:  Have students practice 
saying the same phrase 
repeatedly but using their voices

Text structure refers to how an author 
organizes information in a text. Being 
aware of non-fiction text structures and 
their purpose helps readers to make 
connections, recognize patterns, 
understand what is important and 
summarize information.  There are five 
basic structures that authors use. 
 
 Description - Provides information 
on a particular topic that is vivid and 
clear.  The thing being described 
can be a living thing like a person, 
animal, or plant.  It can also be an 
event, a process, or a place.   
 
Example:  a travel brochure, 
menus.   
Key words/phrases - for example, 
the characteristics of    
 
 Sequence    Provides the order in 
which something happened or 
should happen.  
 
Example:  recipes, calendars  
Key Words: first, next, finally 
Basic: Have students ‘buddy-
read’ selected paragraphs and 
explain which text structure is 
being used. Students can identify 
key words found in the 
paragraphs. 
 
Intermediate: Given authentic 
reading materials such as menus, 
obituaries, brochures, flyers, diary 
entries, advertisements, have 
students indicate the text structure 
being used. Ask students to 
defend or justify their choice of 
text structure.

a specific topic related to a 
content area subject such as 
“Plants”.  Have them research 
articles that can fit all five of the 
various text structures.  Have 
them share the materials they 
found and explain why it fits a

Resources 
A well-written story has five core 
elements. Being able to identify these 
elements and know how they work 
together in a story helps a reader to 
better understand, appreciate and 
evaluate an author’s work. 
 
The five core elements of a narrative 
are:   
  
Characters: the people or personified 
animals and objects in the story  
To learn more about the nature of a 
character, a good reader pays attention 
to his/her words, thoughts, actions, 
and appearance. An individual’s nature 
is his/her usual attitude or behaviour. In 
most stories, the nature of a character 
remains the same throughout the story or 
changes after a dramatic event.  
To figure out the nature of a character, 
ask yourself: 
 What thoughts is the character 
having? 
 What is the character saying? 
 How is the character behaving? 
Basic: Use direct instruction, any 
familiar story, and the Think Aloud 
Strategy to model how to complete

Point of View: refers to ‘who’ is telling 
the story. This speaker is known as the 
narrator. Narrators can be a character 
in the story or a witness who is speaking 
about what happened.  
 
Pronouns used by the narrator give clues 
to help the reader figure out the point of 
view. 
 
The First Point of View: the narrator is 
a character in the story

Setting: the location and time of a 
story. It can be about a place that is real 
or fictional and about a time that is in 
the past, present, or future. 
Sometimes, to help figure out the setting, 
a good reader must look for details such 
as the weather, time of day, landscape, 
and seasons. The setting can be used to 
change the actions of the characters, 
events of the story, and the audience’s 
mood.   
 
To determine if the setting is important, a 
good reader asks:  
 Would the story change if the events 
were happening in a different time 
and place?  
 Would the characters behave and 
feel differently in another time and

Plot: the order of the most important 
events in a story. The four (4) main 
parts of a plot: the background 
(introducing the setting and characters), 
a conflict, the climax, and a resolution.  
The conflict of a story is something that 
goes wrong for the main character. The 
main character can face a conflict with 
[1] himself, [2] another character, [3] 
culture, or [4] nature. In most cases, the 
character then takes action to solve this 
problem. Good readers know that there 
may be more than one major conflict in a 
story. 
The climax is the most exciting part of 
the story. In most stories, this happens 
right before the problem is solved. Being 
able to follow a clear plot helps a reader 
to better understand, enjoy and evaluate 
an author’s work. 
 
The resolution is how the 
conflict/problem is solved and happens 
near the end of the story. 
 
Theme: the message or lesson that the 
author wants the reader to learn from a 
story 
point of view of the character. 
 Create the picture on the 
postcard to show the most 
important setting in the story.

yourself:  
 Did the main character change after 
solving the problem?  
 What lesson did this experience 
teach the main character about being 
a better person? 
 Can this lesson also help me become

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Context Clues are the words that 
surround an unfamiliar word.  These 
words give clues about the meaning 
of the new word.  Some context 
clues are: 
 
Synonyms – Words that mean the 
same or almost the same as an 
unfamiliar word.  
 
Example:  The water tower stands 
126 feet tall and offers a breath 
taking or amazing view of Nassau. 
  
Antonyms – Sometimes a context 
clue would contrast with a new word.  
 
Example:  The guineps from Ms. 
Thurston’s tree were succulent, but 
the ones from Mr. Mason’s tree were 
hard and dry.   
 
Definition – This is the kind of 
context clue where the writer gives 
the meaning of or explains a word in 
a sentence.  
 
Basic: Introduce the different 
types of context clues, one at a 
time.  Have the students 
complete questions related to 
each type before presenting 
more than one type.    
 
Intermediate: Present students 
with sentences that contain 
different types of context clues.  
Have them use the clues to 
explain the meanings of 
unfamiliar words. 
  
Advanced: Have students read 
a paragraph where they have to 
use the different types of context 
clues to explain the meaning of 
underlined words. 
 
Provide students with a 
passage that utilizes 
context clues.  Have 
students use the clues to 
figure out the meanings of 
the words identified.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Classification refers to the 
grouping of items based on 
characteristics that they have in 
common.  
 
The name of each group is called 
a category. Categories have a 
heading or a label that tells what 
their classified items have in 
common. 
 
Authors often organize their 
ideas, descriptions, and details 
into categories during the 
researching and planning stages 
of writing.  Outlines are developed 
to assist in classifying the 
information in an organized 
manner. 
 
Understanding the existing 
relationships among categories 
can help the reader navigate the 
text quickly and successfully.  
 
It also helps a reader to detect 
and ignore details unrelated to the 
main idea of the material. 
Basic:  Using the Classified Ads, have 
students identify which area they would 
have to look to find certain information.  
Example: Where would you look to 
find a truck to buy? 
 
Intermediate:  Using the Television 
Guide, present various scenarios to 
students where several criteria must be 
met.  Have them select the best 
channels that meet those 
requirements.  Have them justify their 
responses.  
 
Example: Mr. Smith is a retired Math 
teacher.  He spends lots of time in 
nature working in his garden. Which 
channel(s) would you recommend for 
him to watch?  Give reasons to support 
your recommendation.   
 
Advanced:  Using the Classified Ads, 
present scenarios to students where 
they must use certain criteria to select 
the ad that most suitably meets that 
need.

Making predictions involves using 
the information that has been provided 
by the author along with what you 
know already from past experiences 
or personal knowledge, to figure out 
what will happen next. Predictions 
must be relevant to the situation and 
logical.  
  
A reader can make inferences and 
draw conclusions to make better 
predictions during reading, when more 
information is provided.  
 
To make a good prediction before and 
during reading a fictional text, ask 
yourself:   
 What is the title telling me about 
the characters? The setting? The 
events?  
 What are the clues in the story 
telling me about the main 
problem? 
 What do I think the main character 
will do next to solve this problem?  
 What would I have done next in 
this situation? 
 
Basic:  Have students read 
various short scenarios and 
choose the most logical 
prediction from a given list as to 
what might happen next. Have 
students share why they chose 
the option they did.  
  
Intermediate:   Have students 
read or watch a weather report

what a meteorologist’s advice 
would be for boaters and the 
public. 
  
Advanced:  As students read a 
passage or watch a short Pixar 
film, have them stop at certain 
points.  Provide students with 
various possible predictions. Have 
students read each prediction and 
determine whether it is logically 
based on evidence from the text.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The main idea of a text is the most 
important idea that the writer wants 
readers to know about the topic. It is 
what is mostly being talked about 
in the text. Knowing the main idea 
helps a reader to better understand 
and organize the lesser details of 
the text when summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and retelling.   
 
Sometimes, a writer directly states 
the main idea in the text. It can be 
stated at the beginning of a 
paragraph as the topic sentence or 
the end as the concluding 
sentence. However, the main idea 
can also appear anywhere in the 
text.   
 
Sometimes, the main idea is 
unstated and the reader must figure 
it out from the supporting details. 
The supporting details are the 
sentences that tell us more 
information about the main idea.  
 
 
 
 
Basic: A to Z Ideas   As a whole 
group, have students produce a list 
of random topics beginning with 
each letter of the alphabet. In groups 
of three, challenge students to pick 
and classify 10 of the 26 topics, 
based on their similarities. Have 
students then create a main idea 
label for each category formed. 
Allow each group to share the labels 
of their categories. Encourage peers 
to ask questions for clarification or 
give suggestions for corrections. 
Lead from the activity to discuss 
main ideas and supporting details.  
 
Intermediate: Provide students with 
different colour highlighters and a 
short passage with a stated main 
idea. After reading, allow learners to 
highlight the main idea sentence and 
discuss its location in the passage. 
Have students then highlight the 
supporting details with a different 
colour. Gradually introduce 
passages with unstated main ideas 
and model how details are used to

Sequence is the order in which things 
happen. Sequence also refers 
to steps in a process such as a 
recipe or directions.  
  
Authors may use key words or 
phrases to help readers understand 
sequence.  
 
Key/Signal Words: while, previously, 
eventually, over time, suddenly, in 
conclusion, meanwhile and finally.  
   
Dates tell you a specific month or 
year.  
 
Key words such as ‘meanwhile’ and 
‘simultaneously’ are clues that two or 
more events are happening at the 
same time.   
  
If there are no clue words, you can 
visualize the story in your mind and 
ask yourself what happened first, next, 
then and last.  
 
In written pieces/texts, bullets, 
numbers, and numerals can be used 
to indicate sequence.  
Basic: Provide small groups with 
directions to locate an item hidden 
around the school.  Have students 
highlight all sequence key words.  Next, 
have students read and follow the 
directions. After students have located 
the item have them answer questions

Most stories are divided into two 
major genres: fiction and non-
fiction. The Latin word genre means 
‘group’ or ‘kind’. 
 
Knowing the genre of a text can help 
the readers to make reasonable 
predictions and adjust their reading 
speed to match the genre. Readers 
can skim read non-fiction material to 
find information or read it slowly- 
word for word.   
 
Fiction is a story that is created from 
the author’s imagination. It refers to 
things that are invented or that are 
not true. Examples of fictional stories 
include: fairy tales, legends, 
science fiction, historical fiction, 
folklore and realistic fiction. 
 
Realistic Fiction - Stories that can 
happen in real life but didn’t happen.  
 
Fairy Tale - stories about magical 
creatures with happy endings usually 
written for children.  
 
 
Basic:  Book Summaries  
Have the class visit the school or 
community library and read the 
summary at the back of various 
books. Encourage students to also 
examine the book covers. Have 
students then record the titles of 
five non-fiction books and five 
fiction books. During this time, 
circulate throughout students and 
challenge them to identify the sub-
genre of their selected books. 
Provide corrective feedback, as 
required. 
 
Intermediate: “If Books Could 
Talk!”  
Assign each student a type of 
literature. Allow students to prepare 
a speech given by the literature as 
if it was human. Challenge learners 
to creatively include its main 
characteristics, how it is often 
perceived by most readers, and any 
challenges it may experience in the 
literary world. The literature can be 
humanised with thoughts and 
emotions. Encourage students to 
use relevant props or visuals. 
Pre-Assessment 
(before teaching): Have 
students complete a 
worksheet designed to 
identify genres and sub-
genres, based on 
descriptions. Let 
students document their 
scores in their 
notebooks. 
 
Example: 
“My Vacation in Abaco” 
by Jerome Gardiner 
Jerome describes his trip 
to the island in five thrilling 
paragraphs.  
Genre: _______________   
  
Post-Assessment 
(after teaching): Have 
students complete the 
same worksheet. Let 
students compare their 
new score with their pre-
score. Have learners ask 
themselves:

Resources 
In a world filled with free-flowing 
information, “fake news”, and 
persuasive techniques, it is important 
that individuals can tell the difference 
between a fact and an opinion.  
 
A fact is something that has 
happened or something that can be 
proven as true or false. 
Facts can be proven through 
observation, measuring or by 
checking reference books and 
credible internet resources. 
 
Example:  
The House of Assembly and the 
Senate are in Parliament Square. 
 
This fact can be checked by visiting a 
credible government website or 
Parliament Square. 
 
A statement of opinion cannot be 
proved true or false because it tells 
someone’s ideas, feelings, or 
beliefs.  Opinions are normally 
associated with phrases such as ‘I 
think’, ‘I feel’, ‘I believe’ and ‘In my

Engage students with the basic recall 
questions about the text such as: 
‘who’, ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’ and 
‘how’. 
Have each student create two (2) 
large flashcards and give each card 
one label: ‘Fact’ or ‘Opinion’. To play 
the game, read aloud phrases and 
sentences from the letter - some 
opinions and some facts. Challenge 
students on the count of three to

To summarize means to 
restate a text in a shortened 
form.   
 
A summary is different from the 
retelling of an event because a 
summary should only include the 
main points of the selection. A 
retelling of an event or story 
includes as many details as 
possible.    
 
It is important that a summary 
does not include any added 
opinions and feelings.

make a restatement of a text 
using other words.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Comparing and contrasting requires 
a person to look at people, objects or 
situations and think about how they 
are different or alike.   
 
Authors often compare or contrast for 
three (3) reasons: 
1. To persuade a reader that one 
thing is better than the other.  
2. To help a reader pay closer 
attention to details. 
3. To explain something unfamiliar 
using something that is more 
familiar.  
 
Sometimes authors use clue words to 
signal comparison and contrasts. 
Some words and phrases that signal 
comparisons are: ‘like’, ‘are similar’, 
‘still’, ‘in the same way’ and ‘in 
comparison’.  
   
Some words and phrases that signal 
contrasts are: ‘however’, ‘on the 
other hand’, ‘although’, ‘but’, ‘yet’, 
‘nevertheless’, ‘on the contrary’, 
‘nonetheless’ and ‘in contrast’.       
  
Basic: Allow students to go online to 
read the weather report for another 
country and The Bahamas.  Record it

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The author does not always directly tell the 
reader everything that is happening in the 
story.  However, the writer gives hints or 
clues so that the reader can figure out what 
is not stated directly.  Good readers use 
the information given, along with what 
they already know, to make inferences. 
There are several different types of 
inferences that can be made. 
 
1. Cause and Effect – The author may  
provide clues to what happened (the event) 
or what might have caused the event. 
 
To figure out clues about an event  
or what might have caused the  
event, ask the following questions. 
 What is happening in the environment? 
 Under what circumstances have I seen 
or experienced such a thing?   
 How are the characters reacting? 
 
Example:  When we got home, my mom let 
out a loud gasp in dismay!  It was then 
that we children noticed that the front door 
was wide open, and furniture had been 
thrown all around the room.   
 
Basic: Introduce each inference 
type one at a time.  Have 
students complete several 
activities related to each type of 
inference.   
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
read a paragraph or watch Bre’ 
Bookie and Rabbie short stories 
(Sands, 2020).  Have them 
answer questions that cover 
various inference types. 
  
Advanced: Have students read 
an authentic piece of literature.  
Have them make inferences as 
they read.

2. Feeling and Attitude – Authors 
sometimes give clues as to how a 
character is feeling through the actions or 
movements of the character.  
 
To figure out clues as to how a character is 
feeling, ask the following questions: 
 What is the character doing? 
 What is the character’s body movement 
like? 
 How is the character responding? 
 
Example:  Miriam glared at the customer 
as she gave him a refund. 
 
Is Miriam happy to be giving the customer a 
refund?   No. 
How do you know? She is angry because 
the passage states that she was 
“glaring” at the customer. 
 
3. Action - Authors sometimes give clues 
as to what a character is doing, by 
indicating the environment, identifying 
items that are in the environment and 
describing the character’s movements.

To figure out what the character is doing, 
ask the following questions.

 What are the movements of the 
character like? 
 Who or what is in the environment? 
 
Example: 
Mummy gathered onions, sweet 
peppers, cucumbers, celery, tomatoes, a 
lime, and an orange and placed them on 
the kitchen counter.  She began dicing 
them.  She grabbed the conch soaking in 
salt and lemon juice and placed it on the 
board.    
  
What is mummy getting ready to do? She 
is getting ready to make conch salad.   
 
What information did you use to make this 
inference? She gathered ingredients 
used in making conch salad and she 
was dicing them. 
 
4. Problem-Solution – A character in the 
story might be presented with a 
problem.  The author may not indicate 
directly how it was solved but would 
provide clues as to how it was resolved.

place? 
 What does it normally mean when 
something like that is happening? 
 
Example:  Jeremy was extremely hungry.  
He had forgotten to take his lunch to school 
that day.  When he arrived at home, he saw 
an apple pie cooling on the rack.  At 
dinner time his mom wondered why he 
could only take a few bites of food. 
 
How did Jeremy solve his problem? He ate 
the pie that was cooling on the rack. 
 
5. Character – Authors provide clues as to 
the character and personality of the 
characters in their stories. 
 
To learn more about the characters about 
which you are reading, ask the following 
questions: 
 What is the character doing? 
 How is he/she behaving? 
 What is he/she saying? 
 How is he/she feeling?

Is Joanne an organized person? No.   
How do you know?  Her room was a mess,

homework was resting on her clothes and 
not on a desk or in her school bag. 
 
Quite often inferences that are made must 
be defended.  These questions or 
commands can come in many different 
forms, but they are all asking the reader to 
provide the clues from the passage that 
helped them to make their inferences.

2. Support your answer using information 
from the passage.

Resources 
A cause is an event or idea that leads to 
a result called an effect.  Signal words 
such as because, since, so, therefore, 
due to and as a result, help us to 
identify cause and effect relationships.    
  
A cause can have more than one effect 
as well as an effect can have more than 
one cause. 
 
To find the cause-and-effect relationship 
during reading, a good reader will ask:  
 
 What happened? (Effect)  
 Why did this happen? (Cause)  
  
Sometimes sentences that include cause 
and effect relationships do not use 
signal words.  In this case, it is up to the 
reader to make the connection.   
  
Example:  
Jermaine smiled and did his happy 
dance as the big slice of guava duff that 
was placed in front of him.    
   
In this sentence the cause is – “The 
big slice of guava duff being placed in 
front of him”.   
Basic:  In pairs, have students 
play a game of Charades where 
they are given scenarios to act out. 
For example, throwing stones and 
a crying person who was hit with a 
stone. The remaining students will 
identify the cause-and-effect 
relationships portrayed.  
   
Intermediate:  Have students 
create cause and effect posters 
using headlines or pictures from

The effect is “Jermaine smiled and did

A generalization is a broad statement that 
tells how a group of people, animals or 
things are similar. Many times, 
generalizations are not entirely true 
because there are usually exceptions.   
  
Example: Many Bahamians would rather 
reside on a Family Island instead of New 
Providence 
   
Generalizations are either valid or faulty.  
Valid generalizations are based on facts 
or logic, whereas faulty generalizations 
are not supported by facts.  
 
Clue words/phrases that often signal valid 
generalizations are: some, most, many, 
sometimes, often, probably, few, in 
general, and rarely. 
 
Clue words that often signal faulty 
generalizations are: everyone, nobody, 
all, none, always and never.   
 
Faulty generalizations usually do not have 
signal words. 
Example:  Bahamians are industrious and 
hard working. 
Basic: Odd Man Out: Give students 
sentence strips with statements on 
them. Some sentences should be 
generalizations while some should 
not. Have students, in groups of four, 
stand in front of the classroom with their 
sentence strips. One student must not be 
holding a generalization while the others 
are. The seated students will vote on 
which student is not holding a 
generalization. Lead a discussion on how 
they were able to identify the ‘odd 
man’, as well as the key words used.  
  
Intermediate: Invite students to take 
turns reading passages aloud. Have 
classmates listen for generalizations. Ask 
students to explain how they determined 
if a statement was a generalization. 
Discuss whether each generalization is 
valid or faulty. For valid generalizations, 
students must provide the details that 
proved the statement was valid.  
  
Advanced:  Have students complete a 
detailed Generalization Graphic 
Organizer where they must use details to 
make appropriate (valid) generalizations.

generalizations 
being made in a

Objective 2.51 Interpret the author’s purpose. 
 
Content

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Every author has a reason for writing.  
This is known as the author’s purpose. 
There are four common reasons for 
writing:  
 
To Inform - When writing to inform or 
explain, the author uses facts. This is 
known as expository writing. 
Examples: cookbooks, science, history, 
textbooks, and biographies  
 
To Entertain - Many stories, plays, and 
poems are written to teach a lesson or 
simply amuse their audience. This is also 
known as narrative writing.  
 
To Describe - An author may describe an 
event, scene, or person in detail. Words 
that appeal to the senses of the reader or 
listener are used. This is known 
as descriptive writing.  
 
To Persuade - Sometimes an author tries 
to persuade readers to agree with him or 
her or to take a particular action. This is 
known as persuasive writing.  
Examples: most commercials, campaign 
speeches, and advertisements.  
Basic: Present clips of television 
shows that can fit into each of 
the four common purposes for 
writing.  Have students identify 
the author’s (script writer’s) 
purpose and discuss the reasons 
for his/her decisions.  
   
Intermediate:  Have students 
browse appropriate 
magazines.  Students can 
find examples of propaganda 
techniques.  Have students 
share their selections with the 
class.  Discuss their 
responses.    
   
Advanced:  Divide the class into 
four groups.  Select a common 
topic.  Have each group produce 
a piece of writing that reflects 
one of the four common 
purposes for writing.  
 
Have students read 
short paragraphs to 
determine the author’s 
purpose.

Authors sometimes use propaganda 
techniques to influence the opinions, 
emotions, attitudes, or behaviours of 
readers.  There are several main 
propaganda techniques.   
 
 Bandwagon – Gives the impression 
that everyone is doing a particular 
thing and that is why readers should do 
it as well, so that they are not left out. 
Example:  Nobody wants to be at 
home for the Boxing Day Parade, so 
you had better get your tickets now 
before they are all gone! 
 
 Glittering Generalizations – These 
are statements that make people feel 
good.  They can be based loosely on 
people’s beliefs and morals.  They are 
positive in nature.   
Example:  This air conditioner is 
environmentally friendly! 
 
 Name Calling – This is used to show a 
person or a product in a bad light.  
Example:   One brand of cereal might 
be called “crunchy” and “fresh” while 
another may be called “soggy” and 
“stale”.

 Testimonial – Celebrities, social 
media personalities, public figures and 
movie stars may be used to endorse a 
product or a belief.   
Example: “Baseball player, Don 
Roberts, drinks Vitamalt to keep him 
hitting those home runs.” 
 
 Transfer – This is the transfer of a 
good quality or bad quality onto 
something else, by association. 
Example:  During the Covid-19 
Pandemic there was a campaign for 
people to get vaccinated.  Prominent 
people in the community such as the 
Prime Minister, church leaders etc. 
were shown on television getting their 
shots.  It was felt that since people 
have a level of trust in these leaders, 
then they would transfer that trust to 
the vaccine and think it was safe to 
take. 
 
 Card Stacking – Involves focusing on 
the positive qualities of a product and 
leaving out the negative.   
Example:  An ice-cold drink may be 
touted as the best thing to cool you on 
a hot day.  It has a terrific flavour that 
makes your taste buds come alive.

The fact that it is loaded with calories 
or sugar would be ignored. 
 
 Plain folks – This is where a product 
is associated with everyday people. 
Example:  To encourage people to 
attend a particular event, the 
advertisers use a typical family to 
promote it. 
 
Regardless of the author’s purpose, there 
are clue words in his or her writing that tell 
us how the author feels or his/her 
viewpoint about what has been written. 
This is referred to as “author bias”. 
  
To find out how the author feels about a 
piece of writing, ask the following 
questions: 
 
1. Are there “feeling” words included in 
the piece, such as ‘good’, ‘bad’, ‘great’, 
‘fantastic’, ‘terrible’ etc.? 
2. How is the event, person, thing, or idea 
being described?  ‘irresponsible’, 
‘organised’, ‘interesting’, ‘boring’ etc. 
3. Are negative or positive words being 
used in the piece?  ‘distasteful’, ‘tasty’, 
‘satisfying’, ‘dissatisfied’, ‘filling’ etc. 
4. Does the author appear to be arguing 
for one side over another?

relatively easy.  You must first know the 
number of the bus you need to catch to 
take you where you want to go.  Stand on 
the side of the road where traffic is moving 
towards your destination.  You may also 
wish to sit on one of the covered benches 
so you can feel the calm breeze as you 
wait.  As you see your bus approaching, 
stretch out your arm and move it up and 
down quickly to signal the driver.  Pay the 
driver as you enter and sit on the nice, 
sturdy seats.  Enjoy the cool air-
conditioned ride as you see the sights. 
There is always something interesting to 
see. When you are getting close to your 
destination, say “bus stop”.

conclusions. A conclusion is a 
decision that the reader reaches 
after identifying details and facts 
from the text as well as using prior 
knowledge. This conclusion should 
be logical.  
  
Good readers can use the following 
guided questions to help them draw 
conclusions:  
 What are the facts? 
 What do the facts reveal? 
 Do the characters’ appearance, 
thoughts, words, or behaviour tell 
anything about them?

Making judgements is more than 
just forming an opinion about 
characters, things, events, and ideas 
in a story or article that may have no 
consequence.   Judgements are 
decisions that are made based on 
evidence found in the passage, 
what the readers know and the 
reader’s own experiences, beliefs, 
morals, and values. 
   
When reading fiction, readers make 
judgements about the decisions and 
actions of characters in a story. They 
may agree or disagree with a 
character’s actions.  They may also 
decide if a character or an action is 
fair or unfair, wise, or foolish, or 
generous or selfish.    
 
When reading nonfiction, readers 
make judgements about the author 
and the ideas, facts and 
opinions presented.

A Figure of Speech is a phrase or 
word that means something different 
altogether from what is being said. 
Knowing how each figure of speech 
works can help a reader see a clearer 
picture of what is being described and 
correctly figure out the author’s 
message.   
   
Personification gives human 
qualities to non-human things.   
   
Example:  The stars danced as the 
sea breeze whistled the Caribbean 
beat.   
  
When trying to find and interpret 
personification, a reader can ask:  
   
1. Which object is performing the 
action?  
2. What human action is the thing 
doing that cannot really happen?  
3. What is the author trying to tell me 
about this thing being described?

Alliteration and Onomatopoeia act 
as the sound effects of the text.  
   
Alliterations are created by repeating 
the beginning sound in two or more 
neighbouring words.  
   
Onomatopoeias are words that are 
actual sounds.  
Example:  The instructor kissed his 
teeth, “tsk, tsk, tsk”, with disgust.

Resources 
A run-on sentence is two or more 
simple sentences not separated by 
correct punctuation and 
connecting words or 
conjunctions.  A run-on sentence 
does not mean a sentence is too 
long; longer sentences are likely to 
be run-ons only when they contain 
more than one complete idea. 
 
Example of a Run-On Sentence 
and Ways to Correct it: 
 
“Steven Gardiner is the fastest 
runner in the world he wins all the 
races!” 
 
1. Steven Gardiner is the fastest   
runner in the world.  He wins all 
the races! 
 
2. Steven Gardiner is the fastest 
runner in the world, so he wins 
all the races! 
 
3. Steven Gardiner is the fastest 
runner in the world; he wins all 
the races. 
Basic:  Read aloud several examples of 
run-on sentences as well as complete 
sentences.  As each sentence is read, 
instruct students to ‘stand up’ if the 
sentence is correct, but to ‘remain 
seated’ if it is a run-on sentence.  Allow 
students to defend their choices. Record 
all run-on sentences and in a large 
group, demonstrate how to correct run-
on sentences. 
 
Intermediate:  In groups, give students 
several sentence strips containing run-on 
sentences.  Have them use scissors to 
cut the strips at the correct place to make 
each into two sentences.  Allow them to 
write the two new sentences with the 
correct punctuation and capitalization.   
 
Advanced: Have students work in 
groups for this “Runaway Paragraph” 
activity.  Give each group a lengthy 
paragraph that is made up of one 
sentence (a capital letter at the beginning 
and one end mark). Have them take 
turns to collaboratively correct this 
paragraph. Allow the learners to share 
their edited paragraph with others. 
 
Have students 
complete a worksheet 
where they have to 
identify and correct run-
on sentences.

Nouns are words that name a person, 
place, animal, thing, or idea. They are 
known as common nouns, if they do 
not name a particular person, place, 
animal, thing, or idea.  
 
Common nouns are usually not 
capitalized unless they begin a 
sentence or are part of a title. 
 
Example:   
Person: policeman 
Place: downtown 
Animal: dog          
Thing: building 
Idea: fear 
 
A proper noun is the name of a 
particular person, place, or thing.  A 
proper noun begins with a capital letter. 
Days of the week, months of the year, 
holidays, historical documents, 
institutions, and organizations are 
examples of proper nouns.   
 
Example:  
Person: Jalen Pinder 
Place:  Princess Margaret Hospital 
Basic:   Make two sets of cards: one 
set with common nouns and the other 
set with their matching nouns. 
Combine both sets of cards and 
randomly give each student one card.  
Have students work together to match 
each common noun with its proper 
noun by looking for their partner card. 
For instance, the student with the 
noun “cereal” will have to find the 
student with the “Lucky Charms” 
proper noun card. 
 
Lead from this activity to introduce the 
difference between these concrete 
nouns and the term ‘abstract nouns. 
 
Intermediate:  My Favourite! 
Have students ask each member of 
staff to name their favourite: 
 
1. thing, person, place, or holiday. 
2. feeling or character quality. 
 
Instruct students to record each 
person’s response and job title under 
their name. Lead from these answers 
to explain the difference between 
concrete and abstract nouns. Allow 
learners to then edit their writing to 
Spot the Error:  
Fill in the answers 
on a worksheet 
designed to identify 
concrete and 
abstract nouns. 
Intentionally include 
errors with the 
identification.  
 
Provide students 
with the incorrect 
worksheet. Ask 
learners to spot and 
correct all the 
errors. Require 
students to provide 
a rationale for each 
correction made.

Proper nouns help to make one’s 
writing more specific. 
 
Example:  
 Take these books to the school.  
 
 Take these Social Studies books to 
Gerald Cash Primary School. 
 
Concrete nouns are nouns that can be 
physically seen and experienced with 
your five (5) senses. They can be 
common or proper nouns.    
 
Examples:  table, The Mall at 
Marathon 
   
Abstract nouns cannot be physically 
seen or touched. They are ideas, 
feelings, thoughts, or character 
qualities.    
 
Examples:  freedom, January, brave, 
patience, friendship, joy, peace, wise  
 
ensure that proper capitalization was 
used for proper nouns.   
 
Advanced: Editing Like a Pro! 
Present students with a typed Bible 
passage that has all the capital letters 
removed. Have students underline, 
then capitalize proper nouns in the 
passage (like the names of people, 
countries, mountains, etc.). Using a 
green highlighter, ask students to 
highlight three abstract nouns used in 
the passage.

A singular noun names one person, 
place, thing, or idea. 
 
A plural noun names more than one 
person, place, thing, or idea. 
 
Most nouns become plural by adding 
an ‘s’ 
 
Examples:  holiday - holidays,  
                  veterinarian - veterinarians 
 
Nouns ending in ch, sh, s, ss or x, add 
‘es’ to show more than one.

Examples:   
country – countries 
party – parties  
 
Basic:  Accompany the students on 
a nature walk around the school. 
Have students compile a list of ten 
objects written as singular words to 
convert to their plural form.  
 
Intermediate:  Allow students to 
choose a noun card from a box.  
For each one chosen, they must 
write on the reverse side, the plural 
of the given noun by adding an ‘s’ 
or ‘es’.  Students can compete in a 
noun relay game to see which team 
would be the first to complete all 
the cards correctly.   
 
Advanced:   Have students discuss 
marine animals in The Bahamas.  
Have them generate a list of fifteen 
singular and plural nouns. Have 
students compose a descriptive 
paragraph using at least five 
singular and five plural words from 
their lists.

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
To form the plural of some nouns, you do 
not add ‘s’ or ‘es’.  Rather, the spelling of 
the noun must change.  These are called 
irregular plural nouns.  
Examples: 
bacteria – bacterium  
curriculum – curricula  
chateau – chateaux 
oasis - oases 
 
Add ‘s’ to nouns ending in ‘f’, ‘fe’ or ‘ff’. 
Examples:  
handkerchief – handkerchiefs  
giraffe – giraffes  
mastiff – mastiffs. 
 
For some nouns, drop the ‘f’ or ‘fe’ and 
add ‘ves’.  
Examples: 
scarf- scarves 
wharf – wharves. 
 
Some nouns have the same singular and 
plural forms. 
Examples: 
aircraft – aircraft 
grapefruit– grapefruit 
gallows- gallows  
 
Basic:  Have students work in 
pairs to produce the irregular 
plural for the noun given. 
 
Intermediate: Have  
students brainstorm as many 
irregular plural nouns as they 
can think of.  Using a T-chart, 
have students create a learning 
visual chart.  Make a web of 
these words to mount in the 
classroom. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
proofread a passage with errors 
in forming plural nouns.  Have 
them rewrite the passage with 
the corrected forms of the 
irregular verb. 
Have students

Objective 3.23 Identify compound words. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A compound word is made up of two 
or more words. 
sand + box = sandbox 
shoe + laces = shoelaces 
 
Compound words can come in various 
forms: 
 
Open form – This means that there is 
a space between the two words. 
Example:  real estates 
 
Closed form – There is no space 
between the words. 
Example:  godmother 
 
Hyphenated Form - Some 
compounds have a hyphen between 
the words. This helps to show that the 
words being together have their own 
special meaning. 
Example:  up-to-date - current 
 
When using ‘high’ or ‘low’ before a 
noun, use a hyphen. 
 
Example:   
He came into the clinic with a low-
grade fever. 
Basic: The teacher can place 
words in a box that can be used to 
make compound words.  One by 
one, students can pick cards out 
of the box.  Students whose words 
can form a compound word 
should pair up and stand at the 
front of the classroom. Using their 
spelling words, students can make 
bookmarks with the words to keep 
handy as they read and complete 
other tasks. 
  
Intermediate:  Disseminate 
newspaper articles to the 
students. Have them search for 
ten compound words. Have 
students create a glossary with 
their set of compound words. 
  
Advanced:  Have students write a 
short narrative about ‘The 
Spookiest Halloween Ever.’  
They should use at least five (5) 
compound words in their story. 
For instance: tombstone 
Revising Like a 
Professional! Provide 
each student with a 
short passage. Instruct 
students to enhance 
the text by adding 
compound words (two 
open, three closed, 
and two hyphenated 
forms). 
 
Give an extra point for 
each combination of 
verb/noun and 
adjective/noun used. 
 
Be sure to have 
students peer edit and 
display their writings.

Collective nouns name groups of 
objects, people, or animals.  Some 
collective nouns are flexible and can 
be used to name different groups of 
things. For example, a collection of 
keys is called a “bunch”. A group of 
bananas on a tree is also called a 
“bunch”. 
 
However, some collective nouns are 
specific to naming one kind of thing. 
For example, the term "fleet" always 
describes a group of vehicles such as 
a ‘fleet of ships’ and a ‘fleet of cars’. 
 
Collections of Things: 
 case of sardines 
 batch of cookies 
 cluster of grapes 
 ream of paper 
 library of books 
 fleet of cars / ships 
 stack of wood 
 galaxy of stars 
 cluster of diamonds

The possessive form of a noun is 
used to show ownership or to describe 
an attribute.   
 
A singular possessive noun is used 
to show ownership by one person or 
thing.  The possessive of a singular 
noun is formed by adding an 
apostrophe (’) and the letter /s/ at the 
end of the word. 
 
Example:  the apple’s core 
 
A plural possessive noun is used to 
show ownership by more than one 
person or thing.  There are two rules 
for forming a plural possessive noun.   
 
1. If the plural noun ends with the  
    letter /s/, add an apostrophe (’) 
   after the /s/.   
   
Example:  The babies’ shoes 
 
Basic: Place students in groups. 
Have students play a game “Happy 
Families”. Have students collect an 
occupation card from the deck.  On 
the occupation card should be a 
picture of the character and three 
items that belong to that character 
that need to be collected.  The 
second deck of cards should 
contain pictures of the items to be 
collected.  These cards should be 
distributed evenly face down. The 
students should take turns asking 
their classmates if they have the 
items that belong to their characters 
using the correct possessive 
terminology.  
 
Example: The Speaker of the 
House would have his wig, robe, 
and the Mace of the House.  When 
asked, the student may reply as 
follows: “Sorry I do not have the 
Speaker’s wig.”

Possessive pronouns are 
pronouns that show ownership. 
Like all pronouns, they are 
substitutes for nouns or noun 
phrases. 
 
Examples of possessive 
pronouns are: mine, yours, 
his, hers, its, ours and theirs. 
 
Possessive pronouns do not 
need apostrophes. 
 
Example: 
That is Ava’s Alcatel phone.      
That is her Alcatel phone.   
That is hers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic: Have students select a noun 
and an object from a given list.  Have 
them write a sentence with a 
possessive pronoun to show that the 
subject selected owns the noun 
selected.  For example, if a student

Resources 
A verb is a word that tells what the subject 
of a sentence does, did or will do.  A verb 
can also express the state of being.   
 
An action verb is a word that expresses 
action.  
 
Example:   
The school of Jacks jumped out of the 
water to escape the approaching 
barracuda. 
 
Linking verbs do not express action. 
Instead, they connect the subject of the 
verb to additional information about the 
subject. 
 
Example:   
 Keila is a prefect.  
 Irene always feels tired after her dance 
routines. 
 
The following verbs are true linking verbs: 
am, is, are, was, were, become and 
seem.  
 
There are also verbs with ‘multiple 
personalities’: appear, feel, grow, look, 
remain, smell, sound, taste, and turn. 
Basic: Using a graphic 
organizer labelled “Action 
Verbs” and “Helping Verbs” 
have students categorize a list 
of verbs as helping or action 
verbs.   
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
read sentences and determine 
if the underlined verb is an 
action, helping or linking verb. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
read a paragraph about a 
national hero.  Have them 
identify the type of verbs that 
are underlined. 
 
Provide students with a 
paragraph.  Have them 
underline the verbs in 
the paragraph.  Have 
them place an ‘A”, “L” 
or ‘H’ underneath the 
verbs to indicate 
whether they are 
Action, Linking or 
Helping Verbs.

Sometimes these verbs are linking verbs; 
sometimes they are action verbs. To tell 
whether the verb is linking, substitute “is” 
in its place.  If it still makes sense, then 
the verb is behaving like a linking verb. 
 
Examples: 
The peas ‘n rice smells good!   
 Can “is” be substituted for “smells” and 
still make sense in the sentence?   
 The peas ‘n rice is good. 
 
The sentence still makes sense. “Smells” 
is a linking verb that connects peas ‘n rice 
with “good”.  
 
In the sentence “Felix smelled the peas ‘n 
rice cooking on the stove,” the word “is” 
cannot be substituted, as it would not 
make sense.  “Smelled” is an action verb 
in this case. 
 
Helping verbs come before main verbs 
and provide more details about the time of 
an action. Helping verbs include: has, 
have, had, can, does, shall, would, may 
and must. 
 
Example: 
The sea’s movements have been shaping 
our coastlines.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The tense of a verb shows the 
time of an action. There are three 
basic verb tenses: past, present, 
and future. 
 
The present tense of a verb 
expresses an action that is taking 
place now or happens repeatedly. 
A verb written in the present tense 
needs to agree with the subject of 
the sentence.  
 
Example:  The volunteer assists 
us daily. 
 
The past tense of a verb 
expresses an action that took place 
in the past. Most past tense verbs 
end with an ‘ed’.  
 
Example:  The group of athletes 
walked for miles. 
 
Irregular verbs have special past 
tense forms which must be 
memorized.  
 
Example:  The girls bought tickets 
to the movie. 
Basic: Concentration Game 
Provide students with a list of 
verbs that form the past tense in 
an irregular manner.  Have 
students make cards that contain 
verbs and their irregular verb 
tense forms. Play the game by 
placing each card face down in 
even rows. Students can take 
turns turning two cards over. If the 
verb and its irregular past tense 
match, the player keeps the cards, 
and the winner is the person who 
has collected the most cards.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Good writing starts with well-
written sentences. A sentence 
has two parts: the complete 
subject and the complete 
predicate.  
  
The complete subject of a 
sentence includes the main noun 
or pronoun and the additional 
words that tell who or what the 
sentence is about. The subject is 
usually found at the beginning of 
the sentence.  
 
Example:  The major islands of 
The Bahamas are popular tourist 
destinations.  
 
However, the subject of an 
imperative sentence is often not 
written in the sentence. It is 
understood that the subject is 
‘you’. 
 
Example:  Take a moment to 
reflect on the sacrifices made by 
our ancestors.   
  
The complete predicate of a

asking “Who or what is doing 
something in the picture?” and

Leading from their responses, write 
one declarative sentence that the 
students agree describes the main 
idea of the picture. Encourage them 
to add descriptive details. Ask 
students to then draw a line between 
the complete subject and the 
complete predicate of their sentence. 
Guide students to repeat the process 
using other newspaper pictures.  
 
Intermediate: Sentence Building 
In pairs, assign each group a noun 
related to the current Science topic. 
This simple subject must reflect the 
core idea of the topic. Then, the pair

The simple subject of a sentence 
can be singular or plural. When it is 
singular, an ‘s’ is added to the verb.  
Example: The Hon. Patricia Deveaux 
maintains order in the House of 
Assembly. 
If the subject is plural, then no ‘s’ is 
added to the verb.

Adjectives are words that modify or 
describe nouns and pronouns. 
 
Authors use sensory adjectives to “show” 
their readers what they are talking about 
rather than just “telling” them with facts.   
 
Sensory words help the readers see, 
hear, feel – and sometimes even smell or 
taste what is being described.  
 
Example:  The conch fritters were deep-
fried in sizzling oil to a golden brown.  
Chunks of sweet green pepper, onions 
and conch caused its skin to bulge out in 
parts, giving some of the fritters odd 
shapes. Fritz dipped the hot fritter in a 
creamy sauce before placing a piece of 
it in his mouth.   
 
Adjectives may also be used to 
compare nouns and pronouns.   
 
There is the comparative form in which 
two nouns are being compared. When 
comparing two things add ‘er’ on to the 
word. 
 
Basic: Students should go on a 
nature walk around their school 
and write at least ten sentences 
about what they hear, see, and 
feel with the use of an adjective in 
each sentence.   
 
Intermediate: Give students 
sentences to complete with an 
adjective that compares.    
 
Example:  Andros is the _______ 
of all the Bahama Islands.  
 
Advanced: Students can read a 
short story containing no 
adjectives.  They can work in 
small groups to include adjectives 
to make the story more interesting

Students should ensure that they 
use different types of adjectives 
discussed such as demonstrative, 
proper and predicate adjectives.

another adverb.  It tells how, when, 
where or to what degree. 
 
Adverbs that tell how an action took 
place, often end in ly.   
Example:  gracefully, powerfully, 
skilfully, brilliantly, and cleverly. 
 
There are some adverbs that describe 
when something happens. This can 
also include how often and how long. 
 
When – frequently, eventually 
How often – periodically, frequently 
How long – momentarily, continuously 
 
Adverbs can also tell where.   
Example:  nearby, neighbouring, 
somewhere 
 
Adverbs can also indicate ‘to what 
degree’ or ‘to what extent’.  When 
comparing two things use ‘er’.  For 
more than two use ‘est’.

other word in the sentence.  
Prepositions can tell location, 
direction, time, and relationships. 
Examples of commonly used 
prepositions are: about, above, across, 
after, against, around, at, before, 
behind, beneath, beside, between, by, 
despite, down, during, except, for, from, 
in, near, of, off, on, over, through, to, 
toward, under, up and with.  
Location  
The skilled diver swam into the depths 
of the Blue Hole. 
 
Direction  
The mouse bolted under the large 
container in the warehouse. 
 
Time  
Joshua did not go inside until the 
movie had started.   
 
Relationships  
Marjorie is going to the library with her 
brother. 
Basic:  Students can look at 
newspaper articles and highlight 
as many prepositions as they 
can find.  The student finding the 
most prepositions wins.  Mount 
their highlighted newspapers on 
the bulletin board.   
 
Intermediate:  Play the song, 
“Going Down Burma Road”, in 
small sections.  Ask students to 
listen closely for the 
prepositional phrases used in the 
song.  Have them make a list of 
the phrases and circle the 
preposition in each one.  Ask 
them to identify the words that 
are linked by the prepositions.   
 
Advanced: Have students 
design a Preposition Treasure 
Hunt for their classmates. They 
can work in groups to compose 
the instructions using 
prepositions.  
 
Example:  Look under the 
cupboard and behind the math 
books.  What have you found?  
Have students use 
prepositions in their 
composition writings 
to make their 
sentences more 
interesting.

A prepositional phrase includes the 
preposition, the object, and all the 
words that come between them.  The 
object of the preposition can be a noun 
or pronoun. 
 
Example: 
The skilled diver swam down into the 
depths of the blue hole. 
 
There are two prepositional phrases:   
 into the depths  
 of the blue hole. 
 
Sometimes words that appear on the 
list of prepositions may not actually 
perform the duty of a preposition in a 
sentence.  They must be followed by an 
object to be considered a preposition. 
 
Example: Fritz went outside.   
 The word outside is an adverb in 
this sentence telling where. 
 
Fritz went outside the classroom 
door.   
 The word outside now has the 
object ‘door’ and can be considered 
a preposition. 
 
 
Have students underline the 
prepositional phrases.

Prepositions help to make our writing 
more interesting as they help to give 
more details.  
 
Example: 
 Plain Sentence 
They walked to the park. 
 
 Interesting Sentence

the park at the end of the street. 
 
Compound Prepositions: 
A compound preposition consists of two 
or more words that come together to 
behave like a one-word preposition. 
 
Examples: 
 up to 
 as of 
 in spite of             
 in front of

Coordinating Conjunctions join 
words, phrases, clauses, and 
sentences of equal rank. The 
coordinating conjunctions are: for, 
and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. 
 
Examples: 
Joining words 
Massive and mega are suitable 
synonyms for the word big. 
 
Joining phrases 
At Atlantis, you can enjoy a 
memorable experience in the pool, or 
at a restaurant. 
 
Joining Sentences 
My grandmother has lots of elegant 
hats, but she never wears them! 
 
When a conjunction separates two 
sentences, a comma can be placed 
after the first sentence and before the 
conjunction as shown above.    
 
When coordinating conjunctions join 
two sentences into one, the sentence 
is called a compound sentence. 
 
Basic: Present students with specific 
scenarios.  Have students construct 
and orally present sentences using 
appropriate conjunctions about the 
scenarios. 
 
 A student is in the food store and 
can only purchase one type of 
cereal. 
 You want to explain why an 
accident happened.

A clause has a subject and a verb. 
 
There are parts of a sentence that can 
stand alone, they are referred to as 
independent clauses because they 
make a complete thought. 
 
In the sentence below there is a part of 
it that can stand alone. 
 
 Although Jake had an explanation, 
he remained quiet. 
 
 “He remained quiet” makes a 
complete thought and can stand 
alone.  This is an independent 
clause. 
 
Dependent clauses or subordinate 
clauses do not make a complete a 
thought. 
 
In the sentence below there is a part of 
it that cannot stand alone. 
 
 Although Jake had an 
explanation, he remained quiet. 
 
 
Basic: Have students

 “Although Jake had an 
explanation”, does not make a 
complete thought and is known as 
a dependent clause, because it 
needs the rest of the sentence to 
make sense.  It cannot stand on its 
own. 
 
The word ‘although’ in the sentence is 
known as a subordinating 
conjunction.  Subordinating 
conjunctions help to join a dependent 
clause to an independent clause.  
 
Dependent clauses are often 
separated from the rest of the 
sentence by a comma. 
 
There are various types of 
subordinating conjunctions:  because, 
since, if, when, until, while, after, as, 
whenever, before, although, unless,

Interjections are words or groups of 
words that express strong feelings or 
emotions. 
 
Interjections are usually used as a 
greeting, an expression of surprise, or 
an expression of anger or pain. 
 
Examples: 
 
Yikes! 
Hooray! 
Good grief! 
Great! 
Gee! 
Well! 
Oops! 
Ugh! 
Oh 
Dear me!

Strong interjections are followed by 
an exclamation mark (!), and milder 
ones are followed by a comma (,) 
 
Examples: 
“Ouch! That hurts!” 
 
“Well, I am happy to learn that 
information.”

Synonyms are words that have the 
same or similar meanings.  Synonyms 
are valuable tools for readers and writers 
as they can make writing more 
interesting and enriching. 
 
Examples:  
1. baffle – confuse, deceive 
2. beautiful – attractive, stunning 
3. bossy – controlling, tyrannical 
4. funny – humorous, comical 
5. important – required, essential 
6. shy – introverted, bashful 
 
Words may have the same dictionary 
meaning, but certain synonyms have 
strong feelings and images attached. 
These words can impact the audience 
positively or negatively. For example, 
the synonyms ‘filthy’ and ‘unclean’ both 
describe something that is ‘dirty’. 
However, an object that is ‘filthy’ seems 
to be in a worse state than an object 
that is “unclean”. 
 
It is important that good readers and 
writers carefully select the correct 
synonym to invoke the right emotions 
and images. 
Basic:  Have students play 
Synonym Hangman. Present 
students with a word and the 
blanks for its synonym.  Follow

It is important to know when to 
capitalize letters.  In the following 
instances, capital letters should be 
used.   
 The first letter of the first word of  
     each sentence 
 The first letter in a proper noun 
 The days of the week and months 
of the year       
 The pronoun “I”

Resources 
The five steps in the Writing Process 
are:  
 
Prewriting – The writer brainstorms 
ideas about a particular topic and 
organizes thoughts using a web or 
outline. 
 
Writing – The writer follows the 
outline and begins writing, by adding 
details to those ideas in the plan. 
 
Revising – The writer reads the essay 
and shares it with others to get their 
feedback.  The writer adjusts the 
essay, based on the feedback, and 
focuses on using more vivid 
vocabulary.  
 
Basic: Host a Writing Process 
Pageant.  Have students dress like 
a particular stage of the writing 
process and describe their 
costumes which should explain the 
step in the writing process. Add 
music and a runway so that 
students can model their costume 
for the class to see. Encourage 
students to be creative, but also 
focus on the including the correct 
content. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students work 
together in groups to compose a 
musical piece that explains one of 
the steps in the writing process. 
Have them include the 
consequences of omitting this

There are four main reasons for 
writing:  to inform, to entertain, to 
describe and to persuade.  
Whatever the purpose, there are 
some basic qualities that are in all 
good pieces of writing. 
 
1. fresh and exciting ideas. 
2. captivating introduction 
3. vivid details 
4. well-organized with a distinct 
beginning, middle and end. 
5. keeping the audience in mind and 
answers any questions they may 
have 
6. written in a voice that connects 
with the readers 
7. interesting and advanced   
vocabulary that includes specific 
nouns and vivid adjectives.

piece flowing 
9. different types of sentences with 
varying lengths 
10. correct grammar, spelling, and

Intermediate: Have students 
conduct a talk show about the 
qualities found in good writing.  The 
talk show host should make sure that 
each quality is covered in the radio 
broadcast.  
 
Advanced: Discuss how a team of 
doctors work on a patient in an

Present each group of “doctors” with 
a writing piece that is weak in one or 
two areas. The piece is referred to 
as the “patient.” Doctors in each 
ward must save their “patients” by 
ascertaining what is making the 
piece of writing sick, and then take 
measures to strengthen the piece. 
Select four passages 
and divide the class into 
four large groups.  
 
Assign students in each 
group a copy of one of 
the passages. Using the 
basic qualities of a good 
piece of writing as a 
checklist, have students 
evaluate the quality of 
their passages.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
There are four main types of writing. 
They each serve a different purpose. 
 
1. Narrative Writing – This type of 
writing tells a story.  It is mainly 
written for entertainment. A 
personal narrative tells a story 
about you. 
 
2. Descriptive Writing – Uses 
figurative language and provides 
sensory details about a person, 
place, thing, or idea so that a 
clear picture is painted in the 
reader’s mind.  
 
3. Expository Writing – Provides 
information, gives an explanation 
or directions. 
 
4. Persuasive/Opinion Writing - 
This type of writing expresses 
how the writer feels about a 
particular subject and attempts to 
get others to feel the same way. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
recorded commercials from the 
radio.  Have them decide the type of 
writing involved and give reasons for 
their choices. 
 
Intermediate:  Divide students into 
groups to participate in the Different 
Types of Writing Amazing Race.  
Teachers will have to use a QR code 
generator to represent the different 
types of writing.  Place the QR codes 
around the school.  Have students 
use their devices to scan them to 
reveal a particular type of writing.  
Students should identify the type of 
writing and its location before 
returning their answer sheets to the 
teacher, who will record their times.  
 
Advanced:  Provide students with 
different written scenarios. For 
example, one that talks about the 
garbage on the beach after a 
holiday. Have students decide which 
type of writing might be necessary to 
address the issue, and then give 
reasons for their choices. 
Have students respond 
to oral questions on the 
four types of writing.

prewriting steps to follow: 
 
1. Generate ideas.  Strategies that 
can be utilized to help generate 
ideas include: peer discussions, 
brainstorming, grouping ideas that 
are alike, conducting research in 
textbooks or on the internet, talking 
to people who might be 
knowledgeable about the topic, 
conducting a survey, making a list 
etc. 
 
2. Select the best ideas.  Review 
the ideas and then select based on 
those that are most important, 
most interesting and have 
information that is readily 
available. 
 
3. Refine ideas.  Ask leading 
questions that will give specific 
details on which the writer can 
elaborate.  Who?  What?  When? 
Where? Why? How? 
 
 
Basic:  Have students list the 
national symbols that were

events of Independence.  Ask 
them to discuss some of the 
things that they observed.  Have 
them use the information 
presented and the discussion to 
write about three ways in which 
Independence was celebrated. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
brainstorm about what it means to 
be an independent country.  They 
should refer to their Social Studies 
text for ideas.  Have them select 
one on which to write

Sequence is the order in which things 
happen or should happen.  Sequential 
order is very important when one is 
relaying a story, writing directions or 
instructions for performing a particular 
task or describing something.  The 
words we select to indicate sequence 
are very important.

onset’ and ‘initially’ 
 
 Words that Show Next: 
‘consequently’ and ‘subsequently’ 
 
 Words that Show Last: 
‘ultimately’ and ‘in conclusion’ 
 
Another way to put ideas in order is to 
use space order, particularly when 
describing the location of something. 
Space order tells about something 
from top to bottom or from left to 
right or vice versa.  Prepositions like

An essay is divided into several 
paragraphs.  A good paragraph has a 
topic sentence that clearly states the 
main idea and details that support that 
idea.   
 
Good paragraphs also have transitional 
words and phrases that show clear 
relationships or connections between 
ideas, sentences, or paragraphs.  
There are three main types of 
transitions. They are transitions of time, 
comparison and contrast and

Narrative Writing – When telling a 
story, the topic sentence should 
indicate what the story will be about.  
The supporting details should all 
provide information related to that topic. 
Do not include unrelated information. 
 
Example:  The best line fishing 
experience happens after a storm.  
We had planned a fishing trip for the 
night leading into the Labour Day 
Holiday. We were all excited.  We had 
our special food that included delicious 
chicken from KFC.  As we motored to 
our special fishing spot, just beyond 
Clifton Pier, we got caught in the worst 
storm ever.  Lighting flashed, thunder 
roared, and the sea produced giant 
waves that crashed on to the bow of the 
boat. We hunkered down under the tarp 
that we had in the boat. We were 
terrified!  The next morning after the 
storm passed, we threw our lines 
overboard.  Within seconds, all of us 
had beautiful snappers on our lines.  
This continued throughout the day.  We 
went home that day with a boatload of 
fish!

Descriptive Writing – The topic 
sentence should tell what is being 
described.  The supporting details 
should provide vivid descriptions of that 
person, place, thing, or animal. 
 
Example:  The new girl was a sight 
to behold!  Her uniform jumper was too 
tight and too short.  Her blouse was a 
crumpled mess beneath it.  Her hair 
was matted to her head like it had not 
been combed in weeks. She barely 
looked up as she took her seat. I 
wondered what her story was.  Did she 
not have someone to take care of her?  
 
Expository Writing:   
If your purpose is to inform your reader, 
then the topic sentence should clearly 
state the topic or what is being 
explained. Your supporting details 
should be facts and they should all be 
linked to the topic sentence. 
 
Example:  Queen Elizabeth II was a 
much-loved queen!  Her death at the 
age of 96 (after spending 70 years on 
the throne) was felt around the world, 
even in The Bahamas.  For example, all

the Queen’s Medal recipients 
remembered how special it was to 
receive such an honour. 
Her passing has been felt in the hearts 
of many and indeed signals the end of 
an era. 
    
Persuasive Writing:  If the purpose is 
to persuade, then the topic sentence 
should clearly state the opinion of the 
writer on a particular topic and then 
have solid reasons in the details to 
support that viewpoint. 
 
Example: Reading daily for at least

The conclusion of a writing piece 
brings everything to an end in a way 
that is satisfying for readers. A good 
writer does not have to “announce” 
that it is the “end” but should move the 
readers through the piece in such a 
way that they realize the piece is 
concluding. 
 
There are several ways to conclude a 
piece of writing. 
 
 End with a quote.  Like Dr. Seuss 
says, “Why fit in, when you were 
born to stand out?” 
 
 Restate the topic sentence from 
the introductory paragraph in a 
different way.  If everyone would 
obey the laws of the road, we 
would have far less traffic 
accidents each year. 
 
 Summarize the main points.  Do 
not introduce new ideas.  To

school is to review your work daily,

Basic:  Schedule an author to visit 
your class, either virtually or face-to- 
face. Have students interview the 
real-life author by asking general 
questions related to writing and 
specific ones on the process of 
writing conclusions. 
 
Intermediate:  Discuss the meaning 
behind several quotes that are 
familiar to the students.  Have them 
end a story using one of them. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
several pieces related to saving our 
natural resources, such as the 
grouper, conch etc.  Have students 
pay attention to how the pieces are 
concluded.  Have students write 
about a cause that they feel is 
important.  Have them use one of the 
types of conclusions discussed in 
their writing.

Objective 3.56 Demonstrate voice in their writing pieces by exploring tone and mood. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Voice refers to how much of the 
writer can be felt in a piece.  Is the 
writer interested and passionate 
about what is being written?  
 
The work of many famous authors 
can be recognized by their voice 
and writing style.  
 
The writer’s voice comes through 
in the tone and mood of the 
piece.  Tone refers to the feeling 
that an author creates.  Is the 
piece serious? Playful?  Angry? 
etc.  
 
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the 
piece.  Is the reader happy? sad? 
fearful?  It is important that the 
tone matches the messages that 
the writer is trying to send.  If the 
subject is serious for example, the 
language should not be light or 
funny. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Give students a particular 
scenario on which to write.  Have them 
share their pieces.  Discuss the different 
voices that are represented although 
they were all given the same scenario. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students re-enact 
their experiences with service at the 
Tuck Shop or a restaurant.  They should 
re-tell in such a way that the voice of the 
server is evident, such as frustrated, 
angry, etc.  Discuss the voices used with 
the class. 
 
Advanced: Have the class brainstorm a 
list of letters and notes that people might 
write and audiences for them. Make a 
three-column chart listing all types of 
letters and notes in the first column. In 
the second column, list the primary 
audiences for each of those types. Then, 
write a list of voices in the third column to 
match the right voice to each type of 
letter or note.  
 
 
 
 
Have students write a 
paragraph about 
something about 
which they are 
passionate.  Provide

used.

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The viewpoint from which material is 
written affects the voice.  Writing can 
be done from different perspectives.  
Be careful when writing that you do 
not move from one perspective to 
another. 
 
First Person – This perspective uses 
pronouns like I, me, my, mine, 
myself, and we to tell the story.  The 
story is only being told from one 
person’s perspective.  Because it is 
personal, an easy connection can be 
made with the reader. 
 
Second Person – This viewpoint 
uses pronouns like you and yours.  
The story is being told by someone 
who is looking on. 
 
Third Person – He, she, it, and they 
are used when writing from this 
perspective.  When writing from this 
viewpoint, you are the person who is 
looking on.  Readers get to 
experience the inner thoughts of the 
characters.   
 
Basic:  Have students watch an 
episode from a court case where 
witnesses are giving different 
accounts of an incident that 
happened.  Have students discuss 
their similarities and differences.  
Relate it to the different viewpoints in 
writing. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students visit 
the library to search for writing 
samples from different perspectives.  
Ask them to share with the class.  
Students can also look on-line for 
writing samples. 
 
Advanced:  Have students complete 
a piece of writing written in the third 
person.

Poems have sounds. Two types of 
sounds found in poems are: alliteration 
and onomatopoeia. Alliteration is the 
repeating of beginning consonant 
sounds of words that occur close 
together. Many clichés are written as 
alliteration.  
 
Examples:  
 Jump for joy  
 Sweet smell of success 
 
Onomatopoeia refers to words that 
sound like the noises they make (buzz, 
crunch).  
 
Diamante Poem: 
The Diamante is a form similar to the 
Cinquain. The text forms the shape of a 
diamond.  Each line has specific 
requirements.

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Writers often use dialogue in their 
narrative pieces to make them more 
interesting.  Quotation marks are used to 
set apart the exact words of the speaker 
from the rest of the sentence. One of the 
quotation marks appears at the 
beginning of what was said and the other 
at the end.  The first word in a quote is 
capitalized. 
 
Example: 
“Did Jason leave?” I asked. 
 
Commas are used to separate who is 
speaking from what is being said. The 
dialogue tag is the part that tells which 
character spoke and describes how they 
spoke.  
 
Example:  
 “Prince,” Karen questioned with a smile, 
“What is your favourite planet?” 
 
 The Dialogue Tag: Karen questioned 
with a smile. 
 
He shrugged his shoulders, “I did not see 
your bag!” he mumbled. 
 The Dialogue Tag: he mumbled. 
 
Basic: Have students place 
quotation marks and commas 
correctly in given sentences. Ask 
learners to circle the dialogue tag 
in each sentence.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
collect famous quotes and their 
authors that focus on popular 
themes such as honesty, hard 
work etc.  Assign them a piece of 
writing in which they are to use 
some of these quotes.  Have them 
use these quotes in their writing to 
make an interesting introduction, 
support a point, or conclude a 
piece. 
 
Advanced: Cut and paste a small 
section of chats from Zoom or 
Team’s class conversations.   
Have them write the conversation 
using appropriate grammatical 
conventions (quotation marks, 
commas, etc.). Encourage 
students to use various verbs and 
adverbs in the dialogue tags. 
 
Cartoon Strips: 
Collect several 
cartoon or comic 
strips that contain a 
lot of dialogue. In 
pairs, give students a 
strip to write the 
conversation using 
paragraphs and 
correct punctuation 
(quotation marks, 
commas, etc.).   
 
Challenge learners to 
use a variety of 
specific verbs and 
adverbs in the 
dialogue tags.

Quotation marks are used to identify the 
title of a song or a piece of writing. The 
first quotation mark goes at the 
beginning of the title and the second 
quotation mark at the end of the title. 
 
Example: “Who Let the Dogs Out” is the 
name of a favourite Bahamian song by 
Baha Men.  
 
To increase the impact of their writing, 
writers often use familiar quotes or 
quotes from famous people to get the 
attention of the reader.  These quotes 
are set off by commas.  They begin with 
a capital letter and quite often a comma 
separates them from the rest of the 
sentence.

Narrative writing tells a story or part 
of a story. Narrative writing can be 
seen in short stories, biographies, 
autobiographies, essays, poems, 
and plays. A narrative essay should 
have an introduction, body, and a 
conclusion. The general 
characteristics of a narrative 
includes:  
 
 Characterization 
 Setting 
 Plot structure   
o Introduction  
o Development  
o Conclusion  
  
Characters are the people or 
animals in a story.  The protagonist 
is the word used to describe the 
hero. The antagonist is the villain in 
the story. Time should be spent 
developing descriptions of major 
characters.  Use specific words to 
describe some of their unique 
physical characteristics as they 
relate to their faces, hair, and 
bodies. (See Grade 4 Curriculum) 
Basic: Have students spend 
time developing particular traits 
of characters for a story that they 
will write.  They can look at 
pictures from magazines etc. 
and develop a character from 
them.  Have them include these 
traits in their story (physical 
features, facial features, 
movement etc.). 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
watch video clips depicting the 
preparation made for a general 
election (dissolving of 
parliament, election day 
announced, nomination day, 
campaigning etc).  Have them 
write a story from the voter’s 
point of view. They should 
interview an actual voter to help 
with ideas.  Special attention 
should be given to describing the 
setting, characters in the story 
and developing the plot in a

A descriptive essay is a group of 
paragraphs that can describe a person, 
place, event, or idea.  The author uses 
descriptive details, phrasing, and 
literary devices to make the writing 
come alive and make it easier for the 
reader to visualize what the writer is 
describing.   
 
A descriptive essay should have a 
captivating introduction that provides 
the reader with an overview of what the 
essay will be about.  The body of the 
essay should provide specific details 
about what is being described.  The 
writer should end with a concluding 
thought about the thing, place or person 
that was described.    
 
There are several strategies that 
authors use when writing descriptively.  
The words that are used to describe, 
should be carefully selected so that 
they convey detailed images to the 
readers. 
 
 
Basic: Display a poorly written 
descriptive essay. Have students 
evaluate its ‘descriptive strength’, 
using a rubric.  As a whole class, 
have students revise and re-write 
this descriptive essay using literary 
devices and other descriptive 
details. Have them re-score the 
passage.

 Show Me, Don’t Tell Me is a 
strategy that authors use.  For 
example, instead of saying that a 
person is afraid, authors show that a 
person is afraid. 
 
Example: 
Robert’s voice began to tremble, 
as his lips quivered, and his 
saucer-like eyes shifted to the door 
that was slowly beginning to open. 
 
 Sensory details are words used to 
appeal to the five senses. They also 
include describing emotions and 
attitudes. 
  
Example: 
Madison, a one-year-old Labrador 
dog with a black, shiny coat, was

Friendly letters are written to our family, 
friends, and anyone with whom we have 
a personal relationship. They are 
examples of informal writing, and the 
tone is friendly. Friendly letters should 
include the following: 
 
 The heading - This includes the 
address of the sender and the date. 
It is normally written in the right-hand 
corner at the top of the page. 
  
 Salutation or Greeting - This is the 
way to identify to whom the letter is 
being written. It usually begins with 
“Dear”.  A comma follows the name 
of the person to whom you are 
writing. 
 
 The Body of the Letter – This is 
considered the main part of the letter. 
Include all the interesting details 
about family and friends and write 
about what you have been doing 
(hobbies etc.). Indent at the 
beginning of each paragraph.    
 
 The Closing – This is a way of 
ending the letter or signing off.  
Basic: Have students, within 
small groups, create an 
infomercial for the friendly 
letter, in which they creatively 
define it and all its components. 
Each group member will have a 
different letter component to 
highlight. The teacher can allow 
students to record their ads or

ORAL PRESENTATION RUBRIC 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the oral presentation skills of students in Grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors 
are so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: content and delivery. This gives flexibility of use, as teachers and students can decide whether to focus on one aspect 
of an oral presentation or both sections.

USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEACHING OF READING 
 
 
THE READING PROCESS  
 
The reading process aims to provide readers with a systematic framework to monitor and guide their thinking, understanding, 
and response to a text. The overarching goal is for learners to eventually apply this process with automaticity inside and outside 
the classroom environment. However, to achieve this goal, readers must have multiple opportunities to observe this process 
being effectively applied to various texts and be allowed to use this method with guided support.  
 
The following Guide Steps for The Reading Process can be placed on individual bookmarks or posted on a classroom chart 
for ease of reference by students. 
 
BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
 Scan the Text. Ask yourself: 
o Is this text fiction or non-fiction?  
o Scan the cover, title, chapter 
headings, and pictures of a 
fictional text. 
o Scan the headings, bold print, 
and illustrations of a non-fictional 
text. 
o Skim read a few of the words. 
 
 
Think about what you know already 
about this topic.* 
 


 Read the text in chunks.  
 
 Stop and check if you understood 
what was read. Ask yourself: 
o What has happened so far? What 
important information was given 
already? 
o How am I feeling about what I am 
reading? 
o Do I need to re-read any 
confusing parts? 
o Can I see a clear picture in my 
mind of what is being shared? 
o Are the illustrations helping me to 
 Summarize and reflect on the main 
ideas of what you read. Ask yourself: 
o Did I learn any new information or 
ideas? 
o Do I have any burning questions 
left unanswered about this topic? 
 
 Connect it to your real life. Ask 
yourself: 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something else I read? 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something I have experienced 
before?

o Were my predictions correct? If 
not, what is my new prediction? 
 
 Figure out only important unknown 
words. Ask yourself: 
 Are there any context clues or 
word parts to help me figure out 
the meaning?    
 Evaluate what you read. Ask 
yourself: 
o Did I agree or disagree with these 
ideas? 
o Have I changed my mind or 
feelings about this topic? If so, 
why? 
 
 
*NOTE: Pay careful attention to the student’s responses here and determine if the reader has sufficient background 
knowledge about the topic to understand what is about to be read. If it seems that the reader does not, pause here and 
provide learning experiences to build knowledge before reading.  
 
 
BASAL READERS 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-levelled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate 
reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension 
skills, and vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journeys 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 286 
 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
THE LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE APPROACH 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the 
board or chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the Language Arts 
components (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teacher’s observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read 
orally. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps 
the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 287 
 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading focuses on developing readers’ ability to independently apply both strategies and skills in context. Readers are 
arranged in groups of four to six based on their instructional reading level and provided more targeted reading instruction and 
support. The instructional sessions are focused on the students’ use of multiple strategies or skills in context.  
 
BASIC ROUTINE FOR USING GUIDED-READING INSTRUCTION 
1. 
Conduct a diagnostic assessment of readers. 
5. Provide direct instruction or coaching on a specific 
strategy or skill. 
2. 
Group students according to their reading levels. 
6. Offer meaningful activities to the rest of the class while 
engaged with a group. 
3. 
Select a variety of texts at the instructional level for each 
group. 
7. Conduct ongoing reading-level assessments to track 
progress. 
4. 
Allow students during group sessions to read the entire 
text or sections. 
8. Provide individual or peer-led instruction to students who 
require further instruction. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings about the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The student encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in Social Studies, 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 288 
 
Science, and Arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialised the subject matter becomes, the more demand 
for reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  A lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ abilities and interests, and be ready to help students find the right books at the 
right time.  Learning students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can 
be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage 
students to visit their school libraries. 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least a 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate.

SAMPLE READING ENRICHMENT DAY MENU 
 
The Power of Choice! People are naturally more motivated to participate in an activity when given individual choice, and 
learning strategies are built on this tendency. They are flexible enough to be used with any content, ability, or grade level. Here 
is a sample of a Reading Learning Menu that can be used on Enrichment Day. Students are to complete all activities from the 
‘Must Do’ category and choose reading activities from the ‘Can Do’ category according to their preference.

DAILY ROUTINE FOR VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION 
 
Vocabulary is the gateway to comprehension, and greater word knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding of a text. While 
this is true, it is impossible to teach the meaning of every word to students. Therefore, vocabulary instruction in the classroom 
should be reserved for words that would have the greatest impact on the comprehension of a text. When learning the meaning 
of an unknown word, the definition is only the first step. Students must have multiple opportunities to engage with the word and 
be able to use it in different forms and contexts. Below is a basic 5–10-minute daily routine for vocabulary instruction for 
unknown words:  
 
DAY 1 
DAY 2 
DAY 3 
DAY 4 
DAY 5 
DIRECT

DEEPENING WORD 
KNOWLEDGE 
GAMES 
DISCUSSION / 
PRESENTATION 
Give direct instruction 
on the meaning of the 
word. Provide 
descriptions, 
illustrations, and 
examples of the word 
usage in everyday life. 
 
Allow students to use 
pictures, words, or body 
movements to 
represent its meaning, 
description, 
explanation, or 
example. Encourage 
creativity. 
Provide vocabulary 
activities to deepen the 
experience (examples / 
non-examples, 
analogies, related 
words, word parts, 
compare and contrast 
meanings with other 
words, etc.). 
Play vocabulary games 
with the focused words 
and other familiar 
words. 
Have students present 
their understanding of 
the word and its usage 
to a partner or another 
audience. Encourage 
creativity. 
NEXT STEP: The new vocabulary can now be added to the classroom word wall or the students’ personalized spelling log. Be 
sure to continuously revise these words in a fun way!

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL: HANDWRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRIC 
OVERALL LEGIBILITY 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the legibility of students’ writing in Grades 4 to 6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors are 
so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: letter formation and presentation. This gives flexibility of use, as teachers and students can focus on one aspect of 
their handwriting or both sections during assessments.

MATHEMATICS
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit


iv 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics Curriculum focuses on fundamental mathematics concepts and skills, as well as on making connections between related mathematics concepts, 
between mathematics and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life. It also supports new learning about mathematical modelling and financial literacy. 
Additionally, this curriculum is designed to help students build confidence in approaching mathematics and acquire a positive attitude towards the same, learn from their mistakes, 
work collaboratively with others towards a shared goal, value deep thinking and making connections, and become capable and confident mathematics learners. 
 
The curriculum, with varying definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching-learning process that students of an academic programme are required to undergo. It includes 
objectives and learning outcomes, course contents, teaching methodologies and methods of assessment of learning. Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a 
fast pace and new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised accordingly. 
In an effort to remain current with the national mathematics standards, advances in technology and the needs of an ever-evolving society, a timespan of five (5) years has been 
allocated for this document. The period 2022 –  2027 DOES NOT indicate the demise and or extinction of this document, but instead reflects the quinquennial rotation of 
continuous revision, monitoring and assessment of the same. 
The Bahamas Primary Mathematics syllabus has been revised and will be put into effect during the Academic Year (2021 – 2022). The revised syllabus is aligned with the 
rationale and aims of the National Curriculum Framework and is also addressing feedback received on the current syllabus. Below are some changes that are prominent in the 
revised version:  
 
 Inclusion of the Ministry of Education vision, mission and belief statements; 
 Addition of Profile of the Ideal Graduate; 
 Moving from six mathematical strands to five strands as prescribed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; 
 Insertion of various topics for a better flow of teaching the subject; 
 Alignment of topics in the Pacing Guide with the strands and objectives; and 
 Placement of number of weeks/ periods and time allocation on the Pacing Guide. 
 
It is hoped that this curriculum document, prepared by the Curriculum Team, will serve the purpose of meeting our national, social and economic needs, and it would also provide 
the level of competency specified in the Department of Education’s Framework to make it compatible with international educational standards.

THE LATE MRS. JOANNE REDHEAD 
 
During the early 1980’s, Mrs. Redhead formed a team which travelled extensively and gathered information to assist in the development of the original Mathematics curricula 
for primary schools.  The first draft of the completed document was released into schools in 1992 and was the guide that was used to aid the teaching of Mathematics from 
1992 to 1998.  
 
During this period, Mrs. Redhead worked continuously, and oversaw the development and production of the revised 1999 Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines draft 
which replaced the original draft (1992 -1998).  Thank you, Mrs. Redhead and may your soul find rest.

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
  
 
 
Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry, commerce, the day to day living in society/world and is essential to the quality of life of our 
people. Mathematics requires thinking, reasoning, and understanding of principles, thoughts, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the 
development of mathematical concepts. Its specific focus is to prepare students to explore, discuss, develop, test, and apply mathematical concepts in the further growth and 
development of society. 
 
The rationale of the Mathematics Curriculum is in alignment with United Nations’ Sustainable Developmental Goal Number 4, which highlights the broad area of Education. 
Listed below are components from the curriculum that support Goal Number 4. 
 
 Develop critical and engaged approach towards learning; 
 Make connections between their own lives and those of others throughout the world; 
 Identify own learning needs for personal development; 
 Impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings and on national economic growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008); and 
 Support of technology and shared knowledge to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RATIONALE

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
 
 
 
In order to understand the expectations of the mathematics curriculum more fully, the curriculum writing team offers the following mathematics processing standards to consider 
as you strive to reach these goals with your students/children. The mathematics processing standards incorporate the 4Cs of Learning and Innovative Skills: Critical Thinking 
and Problem Solving, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication, as well as the profile of a graduate of The Bahamas education system in the 21st century. 
 
   1.     Students will become mathematical problem solvers. Every Mathematics lesson should have some element of problem solving to challenge the students.  There are two 
main types of problems: routine and non-routine. Routine problems are usually application problems and can be solved by applying an operation of a formula.  We teach 
children to reason and think critically with these problems when we work on reading for understanding. Teaching key words such as ‘altogether means to add,’ does not 
lead to understanding and is an inappropriate problem solving technique. Asking students to draw a picture of what is happening in the story helps students make 
connections to the concept of the operations and involves reasoning. Have students apply developing problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and 
conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding. 
 
Non-routine problems tend to be more open-ended, may have more than one answer or solution and usually require a strategy to solve the problem. These problems require 
reasoning and not simply application of operations. A teacher with a well-balanced mathematics programme uses a combination of problems with his/her students. 
 
 
      2.   Students will be able to communicate mathematically. In order for students to achieve this goal, they must be encouraged daily to communicate in class through small 
and large group discussions and writing. Oral and written presentations, creating their own story problems and explaining HOW they arrived at solutions are ideal ways 
to achieve this goal and are methods supported through the activities in this curriculum/resource guide. 
 
 
3. Students will develop self-confidence with Mathematics. In order to develop self-confidence, students and teachers need to have success in Mathematics.  Build on your 
students’ previous experiences and draw on your own. 
 
 
4. Students will learn to value Mathematics. Students will achieve this goal over time if they see the enthusiasm for the subject.  School-wide projects such as Math Day or 
“One Hundred Day” celebrations in primary schools and “Invention Day” in the high schools or national projects like Math at the Mall that will assist in developing this 
goal.  Speakers with jobs that use Mathematics (which is most careers) are also helpful. Finding examples of Mathematics used properly or improperly on TV, social media 
and in the newspapers is another worthwhile connection.

A DISCUSSION

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
 
5. Students will be able to make connections within the field of Mathematics, and with Mathematics in the real world.   Students should understand Mathematics as a 
necessary set of skills and concepts for the real world; therefore, teachers are encouraged to integrate Mathematics teaching with other subjects.  Also when working with 
one strand, use skills from other strands.  For example, Data Analysis and Probability and Number and Operations blend well together. 
 
 
6. Students will learn to work cooperatively.  Most jobs that require a mathematical background are those where people must collaborate.  Therefore, the activities in the 
curriculum support peer tutoring, cooperative learning, pairing of students, group projects, group presentations and activities in which each student in the class participates. 
 
 
7. Students will become more proficient in the use of technology and other mathematical tools.  While calculator and computers are the primary pieces of technology 
used in Mathematics, students should also learn how to use the rulers, compasses, protractors and other tools.  In addition, students also need to learn which tool is 
appropriate for a given situation. These learning tools allow students to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems.

Attitudes 
Way a person views something or tends to behave towards it.  Mathematical attitudes include showing confidence in using mathematics, 
perseverance in solving problems, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work.  These attitudes will enable success in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics. 
 
Concepts 
 
 
 
Scheme or plan for Mathematics. Key mathematical concepts include addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and fractions,  
 
Content Standards   
            Cover what students are to learn in various subject areas, such as Mathematics and Science.  
 
Essential Questions  
Develop foundational understandings. They provide the fundamental organizing principles that bound an inquiry and guide the development 
of meaningful, authentic tasks. Essential questions have several key components: 
 
 Attempts to answer essential questions and allow people to explore the connection between their personal, individual, unique 
experience of the world and its exterior objective, held-in-common dimensions. In exploring essential questions together, people are 
able to find expression for their own strongest gifts and interests at the same time that they are able to establish a sense of community 
with others. 
 Essential questions allow us to explore what knowledge is, how it came to be, and how it has changed through human history. 
 An essential question is always posed at the boundary of the known and the unknown. While permitting fruitful exploration of what 
others before us have learned and discovered, attempts to answer an essential question open up mysteries that successively reveal 
themselves the more we come to "know". 
 An essential question reaches beyond itself. It is embedded in ideals of freedom, strength, and possibility that permit people to come-
to-know without becoming trapped in constructs that are unfair or no longer useful. Essential questions arise from an implicit 
commitment to human efficacy: to a belief that individuals can make a difference, that knowledge can both be acquired and changed. 
 An essential question engages the imagination in significant ways. Without imagination, we could not ask the questions that drive 
science forward. We would have no art, no stories, no mathematics, no philosophy. Moreover, it is questions that spark the 
imagination that permit young and old to journey together into unknown realms. Imagination knows no bounds, no restrictions; nor do 
the questions we pose when we cultivate our powers of imagination. An essential question that arises from imaginative engagement is 
an important way to bring teacher, student, and subject matter together in ways that enrich all three.

 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
                                                                                                                       
 
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) proposed five strands/standards that are content oriented. For the content standards/strands, the goals are further broken 
down into objectives. 
 
Number and Operations: Deals with the proficiency of numbers and understanding of how numbers operate. It involves an understanding of how different types of numbers, such 
as fractions, decimals, and percent are related to each other, and how each can best be used to describe a particular situation. Further, it includes the more traditional category of 
school mathematics curriculum called numeration (process of counting or numbering) and thus includes the important concepts of place value, number base (decimal, multiple, 
binary) magnitude, approximation and estimation and calculating using the four rules. Knowing how to represent numbers, recognizing 'how many' are in a group, and using 
numbers to compare and represent, paves the way for grasping number theory, place value and meaning of operations and how they relate to one another. Estimation is a process 
that is used constantly by mathematically capable adults, and one that can be easily mastered by children. It involves an educated guess about a quantity or an intelligent prediction 
of the outcome of a computation. The growing use of calculators makes it more important than ever that students know when a computed answer is reasonable. The best way to 
make that determination is through the use of strong estimation skills. Equally important, is an awareness of the many situations in which an approximate answer is as good as, or 
even preferable to an exact one. Students can learn to make these judgments and use mathematics more powerfully as a result. 
 
This strand emphasizes the understanding of numbers, number patterns, counting, and estimation. Such understanding is best developed through purposeful, concrete experiences 
and the use of manipulatives.  These are the fundamental basis of all mathematics, and teaching this critical area is the first content standard. All students must be taught to 
understand numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems; understand meanings of operations and how they relate to one another; 
[and] compute fluently and make reasonable estimates. The ability to perform mental calculations and to calculate answers on paper is "essential.  
 
 
Algebra: Algebra is the ability to sort, order objects or numbers, and recognize and build on simple patterns. Algebra provides the language through which one communicates the 
patterns in mathematics. Algebra is more than a set of procedures for manipulating symbols. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts and ideas. 
Additionally, it describes relationships that are purely mathematical or ones that arise in real-world phenomena and are modeled by algebraic expressions. From the earliest age, 
students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, make mathematical discoveries. They should have 
opportunities to analyze, extend, create a variety of patterns, use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. The function 
concept is one of the most fundamental unifying ideas of modern mathematics. Students begin their study of functions in the primary grades, as they observe and study patterns. As 
students grow and their ability to abstract matures, students form rules, display information in a table or chart, and write equations which express the relationships they have 
observed. In high school, they use the more formal language of algebra to describe these relationships.  Learning algebra helps students make connections in varied mathematical 
representations, mathematics topics, and disciplines that rely on mathematical relationships. 
 
The Algebra strand develops student ability to recognize, represent, and solve problems involving relations among quantitative variables (unknown letter). The key algebraic 
models in the curriculum are linear, exponential, power, polynomial, logarithmic, rational, and periodic functions. Each algebraic model is investigated in four linked 
representations - verbal, graphic, numeric, and symbolic - with the aid of technology. Attention is also given to modeling with systems of equations, both linear and nonlinear, and 
to symbolic reasoning and manipulation. 
 
DEFINITION OF STRANDS 


xvi 
 The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
Measurement:  Accentuates the investigation of concepts such as length, area, volume, capacity, mass, time, and temperature. Students begin to learn how to measure by working 
with non-standard units and then progress to using the basic metric and customary units. Students also become familiar with telling and computing elapsed time (the amount of 
time that has passed since a particular process started). Telling time and using money link to an understanding of the number system and represent an important life skill. 
Measurement offers an opportunity for learning and applying other mathematics skills, including number operations, geometric ideas, statistical concepts, and functions. It 
highlights connections within mathematics and connections between mathematics and areas outside mathematics, such as Social Studies, Religious Studies, Science, Music, Art, 
and Physical Education. 
 
Geometry and Spatial Sense:  Stresses the development of students' spatial awareness through active involvement in working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  The 
primary goal of the Geometry and Spatial Strand is to develop visual thinking and student ability to construct, reason with, interpret, and apply mathematical models of patterns in 
visual and physical contexts. Geometry is a natural place for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills, The focus is on describing patterns with regard to 
shape, size, and location; representing patterns with drawings or coordinates; predicting changes in shapes under geometric transformations; and organizing geometric facts and 
relationships through deductive reasoning. Geometric ideas are useful in representing and solving problems in other areas of mathematics and in real-world situations. Geometric 
representations can help students make sense of area and fractions. Bar graphs and scatter plots (a graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data) can 
give insights about data.  Some geometry skills are used in many everyday tasks, such as reading a map, describing the shape of an object, arranging furniture so that it fits in a 
room, or determining the amount of fabric or construction materials needed for a project 
 
Data Analysis and Probability:  Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The primary role of the Data Management and Probability strand is to 
develop students’ ability to analyze data intelligently, to recognize and measure variation, and to understand the patterns that underlie probabilistic situations. The ultimate goal is 
for students to understand how inferences can be made about a population by looking at a sample from that population. As children collect information about the world around 
them, they will find it useful to display and represent their knowledge in the form of tables and graphs. Utilizing probability, students need to understand the fundamental concepts 
so that they can interpret weather forecasts, avoid unfair games of chance (gambling, buying raffle tickets), and make informed decisions about traveling or going on a field trip. 
They should regularly be engaged in predicting and determining probabilities, often based on experiments (like flipping a coin 100 times), but eventually based on systematic 
counting strategies. High school students should use probability models and solve problems involving compound events and sampling. Probability is also linked to other 
mathematical content areas such as counting techniques (number and operation), ratios of areas and volumes (geometry), and relationships between functions and the area under 
their graphs (algebra, data analysis).

Students will develop self-confidence and display proficiency in logical, critical and analytical reasoning as well as become proficient in the use of technology and other 
mathematical tools.  They will also demonstrate mastery of problem solving, communicating mathematically, working cooperatively, and learning to value mathematics while 
incorporating classroom experiences with real life situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
         
 
The Mathematics programme, as outlined in the curriculum guidelines, requires that all students in The Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, patterns, ratios and proportions. Additionally, compute fluently and making reasonable 
estimates. 
 
2. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and relationships in data, solve problems and predict results.  
 
3. Make and use measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and determine acceptable levels of accuracy.  
 
4. Use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and draw conclusions about points, lines, planes, and space. 
 
5. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and interpret uncertainty - using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these sub - goals, all students must have varied experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make conjecture, and test solutions to complex, practical problems. 
 
This curriculum document is intended to foster an understanding of the “whys” of Mathematics as well as appropriately meet the current and future needs of the student population 
in schools across The Bahamas. The use of current research in Mathematics and a working knowledge of entry requirements for programmes at The University of The Bahamas 
and Colleges in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the University of the West Indies as well as adherence to our own goals, constituted the basis used by curriculum 
developers to formulate the objectives/content of this document. 
 
It is our intention that teachers and parents use this document to guide their teaching of Mathematics, supplementing it with activities from texts and other resources to help our 
students attain the goals that are outlined within this document.

BENCHMARKS: GRADES 4 - 6 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027

Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. The Mathematics curriculum introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contribute to and serve as building 
blocks for each other across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematical strands that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at 
school, home, and even work settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to view, understand, and appreciate the relationships 
among mathematical skills and concepts. When students build connections and skills, their understanding deepens and expands.  
 
Students should have opportunities to learn mathematical skills and concepts as they progress through the grades and as such, should not spend a significant part of their 
instructional time reviewing mathematics content. Teachers at each grade level should know what mathematical concepts their students have already studied and will study in 
future grades to ensure that topics and skills taught at the present grade level are aligned with the past and perceived mathematical experiences. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into 5 strands: Number & Operations, Algebra, Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Sense, and Data Analysis & Probability. 
 
While each of the five strands deal with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching 
computation, it is natural to look at patterns and concepts from number sense. While teaching statistics, it is natural to ask questions that will require students to compute data 
presented in graph form. 
 
In the Scope and Sequence, there are acronyms to advise teachers when a skill is to be introduced, developed, maintained, and advanced.  The letter I = Introduce, D = Develop, 
M = Maintain, and A = Advance. Proficiency is achieved if students comprehend skills and concepts with at least 56% accuracy as stipulated by the Department of Education. 
Following the Scope and Sequence is a suggested pacing guide for each grade level. The pacing guide is to assist teachers in planning for the year in order to include all of the 
content necessary for meeting the standards in teaching mathematics. Teachers are reminded that there are 10 periods of Mathematics scheduled for the lower primary grades and 8 
periods for the upper primary grades on the Time Table per week. Using the scheduled time wisely, will enable teachers to complete the content at their grade level. At the 
beginning of each Scope of Work are essential questions that will guide the teaching and learning of the strands. At the end of the strands, students should be able to answer all of 
the questions. 
 
Teachers are not expected to teach the objectives in the order presented. Instead, teachers are encouraged to take the objectives and work them into their yearly plan in a manner 
that integrates the strands with one another, and with other subjects. There are an unlimited number of combinations and each teacher should put together lessons that allow 
students to make sense of the material presented. If students attain the learning objectives in the time frame given, then move on. If not, move on and use other avenues in the 
document that will allow students to acquire the knowledge and skills. 
 
Teachers of grades 4 - 6 could begin the academic year with another strand other than Number and Operations if students would have been exposed to the skills earlier. During 
the period of 2005 - 2010, it has been proven (by the Primary Mathematics Unit) that students in the upper grades enjoy Measurement and Geometry and Spatial Sense Strands at 
the beginning of the academic year. It is not feasible to list every objective in the pages of The Scope of Work of each strand in grades K-7 of the Mathematics Curriculum. 
Therefore, the Scope of Work for the year in which it is introduced at subsequent grade levels is reinforced and extended. 
 
 
 
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027

The major theoretical framework that guides the Primary Mathematics Curriculum is the constructivist theory. Constructivism emphasizes a hands-on approach to mathematics 
where students are more actively involved with teachers in creating new meanings. Additionally, constructivism often utilizes collaboration and peer criticism as a way of 
provoking students to reach a new level of understanding. During instruction, teachers focus on having students make connections between facts and developing new 
understanding. Further, teachers modify their teaching strategies to students’ responses which encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict information. Teachers depend 
on open-ended questions for discussions and encourage extensive dialogue among students. The curriculum promotes the following: 
 Acceptance of student independence and initiative; 
 Utilization of interactive and physical manipulatives or materials; 
 Use of cognitive terminology by teachers such as "classify,” "analyze,” and "create" when planning; 
 Responses of students to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content; 
 Inquiry concerning students' understanding of concepts before sharing their own understanding of those concepts ; 
 Dialogue of students with the teacher and with one another;  
 Inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encourage students to ask questions of each other; 
 Elaboration of students' initial responses; 
 Allowance for wait time after posing questions; and 
 Time for students to construct relationships and create descriptions.  
 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxii
 
 
 
FOUR PHASES IN SOLVING A PROBLEM 
In solving any problem, it helps to have a working procedure. You might want to consider this four-step procedure: Understand, Plan, Try It, and Look Back. 
 
 Understand: Before you can solve a problem you must first understand it. Read and re-read the problem carefully to find all the clues and determine what the question is 
asking you to find. 
What is the unknown? 
What are the data?  
What is the condition? 
 
 Plan: Once you understand the question and the clues, it's time to use your previous experience with similar problems to look for strategies and tools to answer the 
question. 
Do you know a related problem?  
Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. 
 
 Try It: After deciding on a plan, you should try it and see what answer you come up with. 
Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  
Can you also prove that the step is correct? 
 
 Look Back:  Once you've tried it and found an answer, go back to the problem and see if you've really answered the question. Sometimes it's easy to overlook something. If 
you missed something check your plan and try the problem again. 
Can you check the result?  
Can you check the argument?  
Can you derive the result differently?  
Can you see it at a glance?

Best practices in mathematics focus on allowing students to be actively doing mathematics so that they can build and enhance their understanding of mathematical ideas. The 
following links will provide more information on current NCTM math standards and best practices in mathematics. Programs should provide a curriculum that is based on research 
findings on how best to improve student achievement in mathematics. Those findings are summarized by Grouws and Cebulla in an ERIC Digest, January 2002. Programmes 
should be designed to offer supplemental instruction, which expands students’ exposure to mathematical skills and concepts. Strong correlations between opportunity to learn 
(OTL) and the mean of student achievement scores is documented in several international studies cited by Grouws and Cebulla. Other best practices identified in this study 
include: 
 
 Daily problem-solving inclusive of multiple steps problems; 
 Opportunities to discover and invent new knowledge; 
 Opportunities for student interaction and discussion; 
 Whole-class discussion following individual and group work; 
 Instructional focus on number sense; 
 Provision of differentiated classroom instruction using a variety of instructional methods and intervention; 
 Use of manipulatives and technology; 
 Use of cooperative learning strategies/peer tutoring; 
 Integration of mathematics strands and other subjects; 
 Use of probing and questions skills; 
 Lessons that are student oriented; 
 Link to prior knowledge; 
 Fostering active inquiry and supportive interaction; 
 Emphasizing the real life relevance of Mathematics; 
 Monitoring students’ progress and revise their instructional plan as needed; 
 Allowing students to reason mathematically and to communicate and justify their thinking; and 
 Drawing on students’ discovery and creativity to keep them interested.

 Give pre and post-tests from grades 1-6.  Pre-tests are given at the beginning of the academic year and are used to assess and group students according to their needs and 
direct teaching practices. Teachers of grade 4 should use the Grade Level Assessment Test (GLAT) results to identify weaknesses and strengths of their students. 
 
  Teach to the needs of each group of students during guided mathematics activities. 
 
 Integrate mathematics across the curriculum. 
 
 Give tests at the end of a concept or unit.  This will identify students learning and the effectiveness of teacher strategies/practices 
 
 Give post-test at the end of the school year to determine students’ successes.  
 
 Record results from the assessments in teachers’ Mark Book, portfolios, and formal reports. 
 
 Host Mathematics competitions to give students the opportunity to compete with their peers and solidify skills and concepts taught. 
 
 Teacher training/upgrading in mathematics instruction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE NUMERACY IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxvi
 
 
 
 
 
The Assessment Principle 
 
Assessment should support the learning of mathematics, furnish useful information to both teachers and students, and be more than merely a test at the end of instruction to gauge 
learning. It should be a part of instruction that guides teachers and enhances students’ learning. 
 
Teachers should continuously gather information about their students through questions, interviews, writing tasks and other means. They can make appropriate decisions about 
such matters as reviewing materials, reteaching a difficult concept, or providing something more or different for students who are struggling or need enrichment. 
 
Assessment is the standardized process of measuring students’ performance to gather information for future developmental use. At the primary school level, National Examinations 
are used to assess the status of the CURRICULUM to gather qualitative information that pinpoint and diagnose strengths and weaknesses. As the examinations are diagnostic in 
nature, for the students to excel, they must initially be exposed to all the content areas across each strand of the Mathematics curriculum as this aspect of teaching and learning is 
critical to their overall success. Assessment should focus on understanding as well as procedural skills. Students learn in different ways, therefore, multiple ways of assessment 
should be utilized.   
 
Secondly, students must become confident in their ability to apply the skills across all of the cognitive levels of learning.  Alexander Bloom (1956), identified six levels within the 
cognitive domain which must be acquired if students are going to fully develop their critical thinking skills.  These levels range from remembering facts, as the lowest level to the 
creating and judging of material that is classified as the highest level. The levels and accompanying skill structures are as follows:  
 
Remembering: Is remembering previously learned material or information.  At this level, all that is required is the recall or bringing to mind the information that was previously 
taught.   
 Understand: Is the ability to grasp the meaning of material.  This skill assesses the students’ ability to effectively manipulate information. Mastery of this skill is shown by the 
students’ ability to effectively: 
 translate material from one form to another (words to numbers etc.), 
 interpret material (explain or summarize procedures etc.), and 
 estimate future trends (predicting consequences or effects and/or draw mathematical conclusions). 
 Learning outcomes at the comprehension level go one step beyond the simple remembering of material, and represent the lowest level of understanding. 
 
ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES

xxvii
Apply: Is the ability to use previously learned material or information in new and or concrete situations. This includes the application of such things as: 
 rules 
 methods  
 concepts 
 principles 
 laws   
 theories  
Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of understanding than those under Understand. 
Analyze: Is the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood.   This includes:  
 the identification of the individual parts of geometrical shapes, structures and units;  
 the analysis of the relationships between parts and of parts to the whole structure or unit; and 
 recognition of the organizational principles involved in the operation of the individual parts and the structure or unit as a whole. 
 Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form 
of the material presented. 
Evaluate: Is the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report etc.) for a specific purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria which 
the student may determine or be given. 
Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on the formulation of new patterns or structures. 
Create: Is the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This involves the: 
 assembling or creating of a graph, table, geometric shape, patterns etc.; 
 organizing or arranging of a set of objects with abstract relations (scheme for classifying information etc.); 
  putting together a plan of operation (research proposal); and 
  production of a speech, play, recital etc. 
 Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all the other categories, plus conscious value judgments based on clearly 
defined criteria.

LEVELS OF QUESTIONING 
 
Additionally, national assessments expose students to various types of questions.  Hence, students must develop an appreciation for answering appropriately different types of 
questions among which could be found the following types of questions:   
 
 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS:  Questions of the four-type option type that consist of a stem with one correct answer and three  distracters.  
 
 
 MATCHING QUESTIONS-ONE-TO-ONE PAIRING: Column aligned questions in which students must match options in column ‘A’ with those in column ‘B’.  
 
 
 SHORT ANSWER / COMPLETION QUESTIONS: Questions that require the completing of a statement or question using a single word or a well-constructed sentence, or a 
multi-faceted mathematical process. 
 
 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxix
 STRUCTURED QUESTIONS: Questions in which sub-question branches follow from a common stem with the easiest question first and the difficulty level increasing with 
the progression of the structure. These would include such skills as the interpretation of information from graphs and follow through questions.   
 
 
 FREE RESPONSE (ESSAY) QUESTIONS: Questions that require explanation, discussion or calculation on material for which the examiner has not provided a pattern of 
response.  In their response to this type of question, the students are expected to demonstrate communication, planning and organizational skills. 
 
Exposure to the various questioning types allows for an in-depth assessment of students’ knowledge on the various subject matters as well as their ability to apply critical 
thinking skills.  Further, National Assessments promote the use of timed tests. As success in this mode requires discipline on the part of the students, continual practice in 
working with timed tests and quizzes throughout the school year will provide students with regular practice in working within the allocated time frames for the various 
components of the examination. Given continued exposure to all curriculum content areas, the different levels of the assessment objectives, the various questioning techniques 
and timed tests/ quizzes on a continual basis, students will be equipped with the skills and practices that are necessary to prepare them mentally and physically to confidently 
write National Examinations.

   In Accommodating Math Students with Learning Disabilities, author Rochelle Kenyon lists the following strategies for teaching students with math-related learning disabilities:                  
 
1. Avoid memory overload. Assign manageable amounts of work as skills are learned; 
2. Provide supervised practice to prevent students from practicing misconceptions and ‘misrules’; 
3. Make new learning meaningful bay relating practice of subskills to the performance of the whole tasks; 
4. Reduce processing demands by pre-teaching component skills of algorithms and strategies; 
5. Use visual and auditory examples; 
6. Use real-life situations that make problems functional and applicable to everyday life. 
7. Use uncluttered worksheets to avoid too much visual information; 
8. Challenge critical thinking about real problems with problem solving; 
9. Focus instruction on building understanding, proficiency and maintenance of mathematics; 
10. Reduce note taking and writing;    
11. Engage students in multiple ways of doing mathematics; and 
12. Use manipulatives and technology. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027

Students of all ages should be given the challenge to solve problems in mathematics class every day. It is only through solving problems that they will become proficient problem 
solvers. Therefore, to help teachers find appropriate grade level problems, in the appendix is a collection of about 100 problems for your grade level. Some problems have the 
answers and for others you have the opportunity of working them out with your students. 
 
How you use these problems is up to the individual teacher. Below are a few suggestions: 
 
i. 
Post a Problem of the Day (POD) in your classroom every morning and let students work on it individually or in groups throughout the day and for homework. The 
next day, discuss the previous day’s solution and post a new POD; 
 
ii. 
Start each mathematics class with a POD. Let student work on it when they finish assignments. Discuss solutions at the end of the class; 
 
iii. 
Set aside 15 minutes per day for students to work in assigned groups on the POD; 
 
iv. 
 Post a POD every other day and let students work on it after they complete other class assignments; 
 
v. 
Assign a POD for homework and give extra credit to students who show evidence of attempting a solution; 
 
vi. 
Post the same POD for an entire grade level every day or every other day. Let students collect points for every problem well attempted (Which class gathers the    
             most points?); and 
 
    vii.   Open every faculty meeting or department meeting with a POD just for fun! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY 


The Bahamas Primary School Mathematics Curriculum 2022-2027 
xxxii
Problems of the Day 
 
 Give students a problem daily. Instead of solving the problem, break down the task. This makes it easier to model all steps in the problem-solving process.  Students can  
 
 
tell what the question is asking them to do  
 
underline key words in the question that indicate the mathematical operation to be performed  
 
delete extraneous information  
 
identify the parts in the question  
 
find the best problem-solving strategy and explain why it is the best  
 
describe two different ways a problem could have been solved  
 
have students develop questions from graphic information  
 
share student-generated questions  
 
ask other students to solve the problem and justify their answers   
 
 
*NOTE:  No matter how you use your PODs, it is imperative that there be a class discussion of the solution(s) where students present solutions with justifications. 
 
**NOTE:  It is fun to solve problems with the class when you do not know the solution in advance Try it!

 1. Read, write and 
identify the place 
value of digits in 
whole numbers up to 
the billions period (12 
digits). 
                       
 
 
  
 Numbers are part of the decimal 
system. This system uses ten 
digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
single or collectively. These digits 
form whole numbers or decimal 
numbers.  
 These numbers can be written in 
standard form, expanded form, 
word form, or short word form. 
   Example:  
Standard Form:  28 964 371 045 
 
Expanded Form: 20 000 000 000 
+ 8 000 000 000 + 900 000 000 + 
60 000 000 + 4 000 000 + 300 000 
+ 70 000 + 1 000 + 000 + 40 + 5 
 
Word Form:  twenty-eight 
billion, nine hundred sixty-four 
million, three hundred seventy- 
one thousand, forty-five. 
 
Short Word Form: 28 billion, 
964 million, 371 thousand, 045 
 School Campaign 
a. Hold a school wide campaign “How Big 
is a Million? 
Collect one million of some small items 
(Example: one-cent coins or bottle caps). 
Allow all students to contribute, count and 
decide where to display one million of 
selected items. 
 
b. Students investigate the question: What 
size room would be needed to hold one 
million basketballs? 
 Have students play a game called “Step 
Forward”. Give a group of students 
digit cards and have them create a 
number.  Call out a place in that 
number and the student holding that 
digit must step forward. If the students 
cannot identify themselves, that digit is 
removed from the number and the 
students are removed from the game. 
The game then continues with the new 
number formed.

3. Estimate by several 
methods including 
rounding. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Estimate means to find an answer 
that is closest to the exact answer. 
The answer is found by rounding, 
by clustering, or by using 
compatible numbers.  
 Rounding means to replace a 
number with one that tells about 
how many or how much. 
 Clustering is a method of 
rounding when all the addends are 
about the same.  
Example 
  669 + 678 + 699 + 682 = 700 x 4 or  
  2800  
 
 Compatible numbers are pairs of 
numbers that are easy to compute 
mentally. 
Example: Compatible numbers 
for 6 are divisible by 6 such as 12, 
18, 24, 30, … 
  541 ÷ 7 = 490 ÷7 = 70 or 
  541 ÷ 7 = 560 ÷ 7 = 80 
 Guide students to solve problems 
using rounding, clustering, or using 
compatible numbers. 
 Show students sets of numbers.  
Example: 673 
670 
Have students tell which method was 
used to estimate rounding. Answer: 
Rounding

4.  Apply mental math strategies 
to addition and subtraction 
(Continue).  
 
 
 Mental Math strategies do not require paper 
and pencil for arithmetic calculations 
 
 Addition: Use addition properties of zero, 
commutative, or associative. 
Example 7 + (9 + 6) = (7 + 9) + 6 
 
  Compensation is a property where you add 
an amount to one number and subtract an 
amount from the other to make a simpler 
addition.  
Example 1:  58 + 72 = (58+2) + (72-2)  
This way you get an easy operation, e.g., 
   60 + 70; and you can do it mentally. 
     
Example 2:  
Change one addend to a multiple of ten and 
then adjust the other addend to maintain the 
balance.  
426 + 394 = 820 
      426 + (394 + 6) = 426 + 400     
     = 826 – 6  
     = 820

4. Apply mental math 
strategies to addition 
and subtraction.  
          
 
 
 Some addition and subtraction 
strategies include: 
 Adding the tens and then the ones in 
both numbers to get the sum. 
Example: 65 + 34 
              60 + 30 = 90 
               5 + 4 = 9 
               90 + 9 = 99 
 
Subtracting in parts 
Example: 73 – 21  
                  73 – 20 =53 
                   53 – 1 = 52

6. Apply mental math 
strategies to multiplication 
and division. 
       
 
 
Some division and multiplication strategies 
include: 
 
 When multiplying by 10, 100 or 100 
place one, two or three zeros behind the 
number. 
Example: 19 x 100 
                = 1 900 
 When multiplying by 2, double the 
number 
Example: 24 x 2 
       24 + 24 = 48 
  When multiplying by 5, multiply by 
10, then half the answer. 
Example: 23 x 5 
       23 x 10 = 230 
      230 ÷ 2 = 115  
 
 When dividing by 2, half the values 
Example: 518 ÷ 2 
       500 ÷ 2 = 250 
       18 ÷ 2 = 9 
       250 + 9 = 259 
 
 
 Guide students to compile a 
booklet with a variety of unique 
word problems. Students will

8. Apply the divisibility 
rules for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
8, 9,10. 
 
A number is divisible by another 
number when the quotient is a 
whole number and there is a 
remainder of zero. 
 Divisibility rules can help you find 
factors. 
Example: A number is divisible by:  
       a. 2 if the last digit is an even    
number. 
       b. 3 if the sum of the digits is 
divisible by 3 
        c. 4 if the last two digits form a 
number divisible by 4.  
        d. 5 if the last digit is 0 or 5 
        e. 6 if the number is divisible by 2 
and 3 
        f. 8 if the last three digits are 
divisible by 8 
        g. 9 if the sum of the digits is        
divisible  by 9 
         h. 10 if the last digit is 0. 
 Divisible Numbers 
a. Students work in groups of 2-4. 
b. Teacher gives students a number 
to use as a divisor. 
c. Students roll three to four dice

14. Multiply and divide by 
powers of 10 
 To multiply a whole number by a 
power of 10, add on as many 0s as 
appear in the power to the right of 
the whole number. 
Examples: 
     36 x 10 = 360 Add one 0 
   36 x 100 = 3 600 Add on two 0s 
36 x 1 000 = 36 000 Add on three 0s 
 
 To divide a whole number by a 
power of ten, start from the right 
of the whole number, separate as 
many decimal digits as there are 0s 
in the power. If there are not 
enough digits, add on 0s 
Examples: 
 
265 ÷ 10 = 26.5 Starting from the right 
of 245, separate one decimal digit. 
 
265 ÷ 100 = 2.65-Separate two decimal 
digits 
 
265 ÷ 1000 = 0.265 Separate three

the decimal point in the product 
after finding the total number of 
decimal places in the factors. 
Count that many places from the 
right in the product.  
 
 Division of decimals numbers is

 An even number is an integer that can 
be divided exactly into two. 
 An odd number of objects cannot be 
put into groups of two without an 
object left over. 
 A multiple is the product of a given 
whole number and another whole 
number. 
 A square is the product of a number 
and it can be expressed with the 
exponent 2.   
 The square root is one of the two 
equal factors of a number. A number  
multiplied by itself equals the original 
number. 
 A prime number has only 2 factors: 
itself and 1. 
Example: 11= 11 x 1 = (1, 11)

 Numbers can be expressed as products of prime 
numbers using exponential notation/index form.   
 A prime number is a whole number that is 
greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and 
itself. 
 Exponential notation or index form is a 
number that has a base and an exponent. The 
exponent shows how many times the number 
base is used as a factor.    
Example: 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³  
   56 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2³ x 7

21. Estimate square roots of non- 
perfect squares using at least 
one of the following strategies:  
 
Identify the relationship 
between the number of 
digits in a number and the 
number of digits in its 
square root. 
 
 
Deduce that if a number 
lies between two other 
numbers then the square 
root of that number must 
lie between the square 
roots of the other two 
numbers. 
 A non -perfect square is a number that cannot 
be expressed as an integer multiplied by itself. 
 Non- perfect squares do not have square roots 
that are whole numbers. For example, 7 is not a 
perfect square. Its square root is 2.65. 
 To calculate the square root of a non-perfect 
square: 
a. place the values of the adjacent perfect 
squares on a number line. 
b. Interpolate between the points to 
estimate to the nearest tenth. 
Example √27 
i. 
The perfect square on each side of 
27 is 25 (5) and 36 (6). 
ii. 
Half way on the number line is 30. 
iii. 
Therefore, √27 is 5.2 
 Using a hundreds charts, let 
students highlight the numbers that 
are not perfect squares.  
a. Allow them to also write the

 A mixed number is a whole 
number and fraction combined. 
 
 To find mixed numbers, follow 
these steps. 
Step 1: Find the LCM and then 
write as equivalent 
fractions. 
 
Step 2: Add or subtract the 
fractions. 
 
Step 3: Add or subtract the 
whole numbers. 
 
Step 4: If you cannot add or 
subtract the whole 
numbers regroup and 
then perform the 
necessary operation. 
 
Step 5: Simplify if possible. 
 
 Allow students to use fractional 
models to illustrate problems with 
solution. 
 Give students recipes with fractions 
of common ingredients. Students 
find the amount of that item by 
adding and subtracting to make the 
ingredient more or less for the 
required number of persons. 
 Divide students into groups of 
fours. Have students compete in a 
relay race to correctly solve four 
addition/subtraction problems. The 
first team to complete the race wins.

ASSESSMENT 
1. Identify and construct 
patterns relating to 
rectangular, square, 
oblong, and triangular 
numbers. 
         
 Rectangular numbers are numbers that 
create rectangles. Rectangular numbers 
are: 
4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18,  
    20, 21, 22, etc. 
 
 Square numbers are numbers that is 
the product of two equal integers.  For 
example 9 is a square number because 9 
=3x3 
 Create rectangular, oblong, 
square, and triangular patterns 
with varied concrete objects.

 Lesson quiz where they 
complete patterns with and 
without pictures. 
 
2. Solve non-routine 
problems where finding a 
pattern is an appropriate 
strategy. 
 Non-routine problems are problems that 
require non-traditional algorithms or 
sums to solve them.  
 Non-routine problems provide a more 
highly probable method for discovering 
the solution to a problem. Building a 
model, drawing pictures, work 
backwards are non-routine problem 
solving strategies. 
 Finding a pattern is a strategy in which 
you look for patterns in the data in order 
to solve the problem. Look for items or 
numbers that are repeated, or a series of 
events that are repeated. 
 Give students task card with a 
variety of problems. Allow 
them to work in groups to 
develop patterns to solve. For 
example, how many different 
handshakes would take place 
between three and four friends?

3. Use patterns to make 
computation more 
efficient. 
 Patterns are used to make 
computation easier. 
40 x 9 = 360 
400 x 9 = 3 600 
4000 x 9 = 36 000 
What pattern do you notice? 
 Give students a variety of 
work cards with pattern 
starters. Let them complete 
up to the ‘n’ pattern set     
For Example:    
 
                    8 ÷   2  =   4 
                  80 ÷ 20  =  4 
                800 ÷ 20 = 40 
              8000 ÷ 20 = ___ 
            80000 ÷ 20 = ___

A point in a plane contains two components 
where order matters! It comes in the form 
(xx,yy) where xx comes first, and yy comes 
second. 
  
The xx-component of the point (xx,yy) 
moves the point along a horizontal line. If 
the xx-value is positive, the point moves 
“xx-units” towards the right side. On the 
other hand, if the xx-value is negative, the 
point moves “xx-units” towards the left. 
 
The yy-component of the point (xx,yy) 
moves the point along a vertical line. If 
the yy-value is positive, the point moves 
“yy-units” in an upward direction. However, 
if the yy-value is negative, the point moves 
“yy-units” in a downward direction.

6. Verify the probability of 
a particular outcome and 
write it as a fraction or 
ratio. 
 Probability is the chance that an event 
will happen. It compares the number of 
favourable outcomes and the number of 
possible outcomes. 
 
 Probability     =  number of favourable 
outcomes 
of an event      total number of possible 
outcomes 
 
Example: Fraction 2/3; ratio = 2 to 3 or 2:3 
  Reuben writes each letter of his name on a 
separate piece of paper and puts them in a 
bag. He chooses one piece of paper from 
the bag without looking. What is the 
probability that Rueben will chose the 
letter B? 
 
There is 1 favourable outcome out of 6 
possible outcomes, R E U B E N. The 
outcomes are equally likely. The 
probability of choosing the letter B is 1/6 
or 1 to 6 or 1:6

7. Use probability to make reasonable 
prediction. 
-  tells what could happen because 
outcomes are likely to occur. 
 
 
 A reasonable prediction is one that 
indicates what could happen based on 
specific conditions. 
 Using probability to make reasonable 
predications must include all possible 
outcomes. 
 


booklet that answers questions such 
as the following: Rashad says to 
Billy “The probability of rolling a 6 
with a die is 1 to 6.   
 
Roll the die. Whenever a 6 comes up, 
you win and Rashad will pay you 
$5.00. Whenever a 6 doesn’t come 
up, I win and you pay me $5.00.”  
Billy accepts the challenge. What do 
you think will happen and why?

SCIENCE
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit

PREFACE 
 
We live in a world that is scientifically and technologically oriented – a world of phenomenal scientific advancement and innovations. As The Bahamas 
keeps pace with this advancement, our children must be exposed to effective, comprehensive Science Education early in life. We must take advantage of their 
innate curiosity and zeal for learning about the environment before it diminishes. 
 
Science is important because it links to technology and industry, which are areas of priority for a country’s development. Science provides ways of 
making sense of the world systemically. Opportunities must be provided for our children to experience science at an early age. It is important for them 
to understand scientific ways of thinking and to have adequate knowledge of science if they are to keep pace with the technological advances and 
innovations of the 21st Century. 
 
The production of the revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines consisted of local educators who accepted the challenge of producing this document 
– a third document for the Department of Education: Science Unit (August 2001, June 2010, and December 2021). The Production Team has ensured that 
the purposes of developing sciences are met. A few of these aims are to communicate, to relate science to everyday life, and to explore, apply and 
investigate scientific and technological knowledge and ideas. 
 
In accomplishing these aims, instructional facilitators will guide students through the use of various communication modes, developing their awareness of 
the importance of science in life. Students will be encouraged to make decisions based on their knowledge of science and issues such as personal health and 
well-being, safety and the preservation of the environment. These students will be able to appreciate that experimentation is not judged by success or failure, 
but by the knowledge, which is gained from the process. 
 
The revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines grades 1-6 boasts several new features. The previous Primary Curriculum consisted of three stands; we 
introduced a fourth strand –  “Environmental Science.” More focus was given to the integration of technological skills in developing the basic concepts, skills 
and activities in the Life, Earth, Physical and Environmental Sciences. Also noteworthy in the document are the deliberate efforts to highlight skills and 
attitudes that we wish for our students to develop. 
 
When the guidelines in this revised Primary Science Curriculum Guidelines are effectively implemented, they will ensure that our students have the 
foundation of basic scientific concepts and principles that develop the attitudes, skills and knowledge necessary for them to successfully work and live 
in the 21st Century.

PRIMARY SCIENCE MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Primary Science Unit recognizes the place of science in everyday human affairs and aim for scientific literacy that is operational in understanding 
oneself. We seek to provide a level of understanding and scientific literacy that will prepare students to be informed and participative citizens who are able to 
make judgments and decisions regarding science applications that may have social, health or environmental impacts. 
 
 
 
BROAD OBJECTIVES 
 
The team responsible for effecting the necessary revisions to the Primary Science Curriculum holds the view that the curriculum should achieve two 
broad objectives: 
 Provide courses of study that challenge participants to acquire scientific skills and academic standards consistent with emerging global 
workforce requisites while simultaneously promoting self-confidence, character strengthening, creativity and personal initiative. 
 Improve the use of technology in the teaching/learning process. 
 
 
 
RATIONALE 
 
To provide opportunities that expose and engage students in The Bahamas in acquiring scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes which will enhance 
critical thinking, problem-solving and organizational skills. In so doing, students will be able to participate in varied scientific and technological 
careers in the global environment, as well as realize the impact that they make on the natural world and appreciate the need for its sustainability.

HOW TO USE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
 
Teachers know that a curriculum guide is the most important document available to them, and without one, it will be difficult to write lesson plans. Using 
the Primary Science Curriculum Guide will support teachers in creating effective lesson plans that are based on the goals and learner outcomes outlined in 
the document. This document is intended to provide facilitators with the overview of the outcomes framework for primary science education. It also 
includes suggestions to assist teachers in designing creative, critical thinking learning experiences and assessment tasks for primary school students. 
Standards and Benchmarks can be split into two categories. The content standards are guidelines which dictate the crucial skills, knowledge and 
understanding that a student must learn in the specific science content area. Benchmarks point you to where the students should reach academically. 
Benchmarks also provide a structure for external assessment. 
Scope and Sequence is a list of concepts, topics and materials to be observed and covered (where possible in this document). The Scope refers to topics and 
areas of development within the Primary Science Curriculum, and the Sequence is the order in which those skills are taught. 
The Pacing Guide helps you to see the big picture for the school year. It provides an opportunity for facilitators/teachers to pace out and create an impetus 
for a certain period of time  and to identify standards or units to be taught during that time. The Pacing Guide also ensures that grade level teams are 
concentrating on identical topics/lessons in a specified time period. 
The Scope of Work encompasses the theory, planning, design, development, implementation and evaluation of units of Life, Earth, Physical and 
Environmental strands of the Primary Science Curriculum.

The nucleus controls the activities 
of the cell. It is also known as the 
control and the brain of the cell. 
The cell membrane holds the parts 
of the cell together. It also separates 
the cell from its surroundings and 
controls what material enters and 
leaves the cell. The cell membrane 
lets, food, oxygen, and water flow 
into the cell when they are needed, 
and it lets the cells waste flow out. 
Cytoplasm is a colourless, jellylike 
substance containing many 
chemicals to keep the cell 
functioning. The vacuole stores 
food, waste and water. The cell 
wall (only found in plants) is a stiff 
outer layer that protects the cell and 
gives it shape.  
Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll 
that plants need  to make food. 
Without chlorophyll, the plant will 
die and would not be able to make 
its own food.

 Sponges are marine animals. 
Sponges are invertebrates. 
They usually remain anchored 
in one place all their lives. 
Sponges are filter feeders. 
They filter tiny particles of 
food from the water. 
 A sponge has only two layers 
of cells. The outer covering of 
the sponge’s body is covered 
with tiny holes called pores. 
These pores lead to canals 
which are made up of 
specialized cells with whip-
like  structures that beat 
rapidly. This motion helps 
pump purified water into 
canals. Thread like 
structures remove the tiny 
pieces of food from the water. 
The water then  flows out 
through an opening called a 
vent. Sponges have needle-like 
parts that give them shape.

 Sponges reproduce by budding, where they 
grow a new sponge on them. Once the new 
sponfe grows big enough, it falls off.  
 
 Some sponges reproduce sexually,  forming 
egg and sperm cells. A fertilized egg forms 
a larva that leaves the  parent sponge and 
travels through the water to another part of 
the ocean floor. There, it attaches itself to a 
hard surface where it develops into an adult 
sponge. 
 Different species of sponges have different 
colours, shapes and sizes. Sponges are 
found on reefs in The Bahamas. At one 
time, Bahamian fishermen harvested 
sponges, which were sold to foreign 
countries where  sponges were processed 
into a variety of household items that could 
be used for decorations and bathing. The 
sponging industry was started by the 
Greeks. At that time, the sponging industry 
was the most important economic activity 
in The Bahamas.

Our teeth cut and chew our food. We 
use our tongues to taste and to mix 
food with saliva. 
    2. The food travels down the 
esophagus to the stomach.  
3. In the stomach, the food mixes 
with gastric juices. Gastric juices 
break the food down.  
4. The mixture of food and gastric 
juices travels through the small 
intestine. Nutrients from the food are 
absorbed into our blood to be 
transported to all the cells of our 
bodies.

 
The part of the tooth that can be seen 
which is not covered by the gum (the 
pink, fleshy part) is called the crown. 
The crown of each tooth is  covered with 
enamel. Enamel is a very  tough 
substance that is hard and shiny and 
protects the tooth. Beneath the enamel is 
dentin, which is the final protective layer 
before reaching the pulp. The pulp cavity 
is where the nerves and blood vessels are 
located. 
 Since teeth are such important tools, 
humans get two sets. Our first teeth start 
to grow when we are just 6 months old. 
They are called primary teeth (milk 
teeth). These are the teeth that falls out 
when we grow. This first set contains 
20 primary teeth.

 By the time you turn 12 or 13 years old, all 
your primary teeth will have fallen out. The 
second set of teeth that replace the primary 
teeth is called permanent teeth. 
 Adult humans have 32 permanent teeth, 
which are 12 more than the first set of 
primary teeth. If an adult loses a permanent 
tooth, it will not grow back. 
Types of teeth 
• Incisors are shaped like tiny chisels with 
flat ends that are somewhat sharp. These 
teeth are used for cutting and chopping food. 
 The pointy teeth beside your incisors are 
called canine teeth. There are four of them: 
two  on top and two on the bottom. Because 
these teeth are pointy and sharp, they help 
tear food. 
 Next to your canine teeth are your 
premolars, which are also called bicuspid 
teeth. You have eight premolars in all: four 
on top and four on the bottom. Premolars are 
bigger and stronger, and have ridges, which

• If you open your mouth wide, 
you'll see your molars. You have 
eight of these: four on top and four 
on the bottom. Molars are the 
toughest of the bunch. They are 
even wider and stronger than 
premolars, and they have more 
ridges. Molars work closely with 
your tongue to help you swallow 
food. The tongue sweeps chewed- 
up food to the back of your mouth, 
where the molars grind it until it's 
mashed up and ready to be 
swallowed. 
• The last teeth a person gets are 
wisdom teeth. These are also 
called third molars. They are all 
the way in the back of the mouth, 
one in each corner.

Caring for your teeth:  
- Brush and floss your teeth 
regularly.  
- Use fluoride toothpaste. Eat 
a healthy diet. 
- Visit your dentist regularly 
for dental cleanings and 
check-ups  
- Do not smoke. 
- Avoid eating sugary foods. 
Sugar can hurt your teeth, 
causing tooth decay and 
cavities. 
- Brush your teeth to avoid 
bad breath, gum disease 
(gingivitis), and tooth 
infection and loss of teeth. 
If you do not brush your teeth, 
bacteria will develop, 
clumping together to form a 
sticky substance called dental 
plaque. Antibacterial mouth 
rinses also can help reduce 
bacteria.

 All flowering plants produce seeds. The 
seeds are produced by flowers. Flowers 
are an adaptation that is important to the 
success of angiosperms. The main parts 
of a flower are the sepals, the petals, the 
pistil and the stamens. 
 The sepals are the green leaves that 
protect the flower while it is in the bud. 
Petals are the colourful parts that 
surround and protect the male and 
female parts of the flower. The pistil is 
the female part of the flower, and the 
stamen are the male part of the flower. 
The female part of the flower produces 
the fruit and seeds, and the male part 
produces pollen. 
 Flowers help to ensure that pollen from 
the male part of the flower gets to the 
female part of the flower. This process 
is called pollination.

 Pollination is the first important 
step in seed formation. A pollinator 
is an organism that transfers pollen 
from the male part of the flower to 
the female. 
 Seeds have very tiny plants inside 
them (seedlings). These grow into 
new plants and ensure that the 
group continues to survive. 
 
 The fruit protects the seeds and 
provides them with food and 
minerals to produce a protective 
coat called the seed coat. 
 When seeds are mature, the fruit 
ripens. Animals eat the fruit and 
scatter the seeds. This allows the 
seeds to grow into new plants in 
different places. The changes that 
occur from the time a seed grows 
into a new plant until that plant 
produces seeds make up the life 
cycle of a plant.

1. Define the terms 
photosynthesis, 
chlorophyll, and 
stomata. 
 Plants make their own food 
by a process called 
photosynthesis. During this 
process, plants use light 
energy to change water and 
carbon dioxide into sugar. 
Sunlight is taken in or 
absorbed by chlorophyll in 
the leaves and other green 
parts of a plant.  
 
 Chlorophyll is a chemical 
found in special structures in 
plant cells called 
chloroplasts. Water 
transports chloroplasts  from 
the roots to the leaves and 
stems, and carbon dioxide 
enters the plant through tiny 
openings in the  leaves 
called stomata. The food 
made is called 
sugar/glucose. Oxygen is

 Oil wells are drilled into the rocks to reach 
the oil. A lot of oil is also under the oceans. 
Oil rigs that float are used to get this oil. 
After the oil is pumped, it is sent to 
refineries. At the refineries, it is separated 
into different kinds of  fuels. Most of the oil 
is made into gasoline. 
 Oil is also used to make products such as 
plastics, paints, medicines and soap. Burning 
fuels made from oil can pollute the 
environment. 
 Natural gas is a gaseous fossil fuel 
consisting mainly of methane. Before it is a 
fuel, it must undergo extensive processes to 
have almost all other materials removed from 
it except methane. 
 Compressed natural gas is a substitute for 
gasoline. It environmentally “clean” and it is 
safer than other motor fuels in the event of an 
oil spill. Natural gas is lighter than air, so it 
disperses quickly. Natural gas is also cheaper 
and is being used more in vehicles.

 
Earthquakes cause rapid 
changes on earth. An 
earthquake is a vibration or 
shaking of Earth’s crust. Most 
earthquakes occur along faults. 
A fault is a break in the crust 
along which rock moves. Rocks 
on either side of a fault can 
move up and down, side to side, 
or both. Earthquakes are 
measured on a Richter Scale, 
which uses numbers from 1-9. 
 
A volcano is a mountain that 
forms when red-hot melted rock 
flows through a crack onto the 
earth’s surface. Melted rock 
inside Earth is called magma. 
Melted rock that reaches 
Earth’s surface is called lava. 
The lava and gases that erupt 
from volcanoes are very hot and 
often destroy everything in their 
path. Volcanic eruptions also 
form new crust on continents.

Examples of these are the 
chemical changes that cause 
food to spoil or iron to rust. 
 
Naturally occurring chemical 
changes can be harmful. To 
avoid the effect of naturally 
occurring chemical changes, 
we can resort to freezing or 
drying to preserve food. Tools 
can be kept well-oiled to 
prevent rusting.

Rusting takes place when

Substances that prevent

 Explain how 
climate change 
affects natural 
disasters and 
sea-level rise. 
Gases like nitrogen and oxygen which 
make up 99% of the gas in the 
atmosphere do not absorb heat from 
the sun. They allow it to reflect back 
into space from the Earth's surface. 
Other gases such as carbon dioxide, 
methane and nitrous oxide which 
make up roughly 0.1% of the 
atmosphere absorb heat. When those 
gases absorb solar energy, they 
radiate it back towards the planet's 
surface and to other gas molecules, 
creating the greenhouse effect. This is 
why they are called greenhouse gases. 
The greenhouse effect plays an 
important role in naturally regulating 
the temperature of our climate. 
Without it the Earth's average 
temperature would -64.4 F. That's 
roughly the temperature inside a 
“deep freeze” in your home. 
The term climate change is used to 
describe a long-term change in global 
temperatures and weather patterns.

The earth's temperature has changed 
drastically in its 4.5-billion- 
year history. During the Ice Age 
(which was nearly 300 million years 
long), ice covered vast portions of the 
planet. Today, climate change is 
commonly used as a term to describe 
the effects of global warming that have 
occurred as a result of human 
activity following the industrial 
revolution in the 18th century. 
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 
are  increasing because of human 
activities  like burning fossil 
fuels, deforestation and modern 
farming practices. 
Scientists predict that if temperatures 
continue to rise, we will experience 
more extreme weather conditions, sea- 
level rise, the destruction of coastal 
ecosystems, loss of vital species and 
crops, population displacement and a 
huge cost to the global economy.

Jane Goodall 
As a young girl, Jane Goodall 
dreamed of working with wild 
animals. When she was 26, 
Goodall was offered the 
chance to study chimpanzees 
in Tanzania, Africa. She spent 
the next 25 years researching 
the apes in their natural 
habitat. She made important 
discoveries about the animals’ 
lives such as how they raise 
their young and use tools. 
Goodall saw that chimpanzees 
and their homes were under 
threat. The same thing was 
happening to other animals all 
over the world. So, Goodall 
created a program called Roots 
& Shoots. It encourages kids 
to create community projects 
to protect the planet.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of  the 
Science Instructional Programme would be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous, for as Scientific Literacy increases so does the students’ 
appreciation of the application of scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies spawned by 
alert inquiring minds to produce positive end results that can be of economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to  incorporate 
current and innovative practices in the Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
❖ 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences; 
❖ 
Increase the effectiveness of science instruction; 
❖ 
Build students’ confidence and competence; 
❖ 
Heighten students’ expectations; 
❖ 
Promote higher overall achievement. 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an 
effective Science Instructional Programme. These strategies comprise: 
❖ 
Inquiry-based Learning 
❖ 
Constructivism 
❖ 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
❖ 
Process Skills Development 
❖ 
Use of the Scientific Method

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning where practical 
“hands-on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities 
and inquiring minds on problem solving through the application of scientific 
principles. 
 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting 
information directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to 
engage exploration, questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that 
this strategy (with respect to the teaching of science) is very ineffective and when 
compared with other modern approaches is now obsolete. 
 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method, especially with regards to 
the teaching of science, results in diminished student expectation and achievement. 
Research “shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been 
poured unto them (via lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences 
that the teacher provides.” Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of science exploration. Practical 
experiences are provided and open-ended questions are asked to encourage 
experimentation that does not necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to 
testable questions. During this experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks 
and are therefore not afraid to make mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific 
discoveries come after many failures and disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for 
practical “hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles (e.g. 
giving them batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity). 
This strategy takes the learning process to a different level (e.g. it may challenge 
students to use the batteries, bulb, wire and additional materials to develop something 
useful for a deaf person or something that can assist with a specific chore,  homework 
assignment, etc.). 
 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of science is key to effective and 
meaningful instruction as it encourages students to: 
 Critically evaluate situations; 
 Frame their own questions; 
 Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment; 
 Cultivate organizational and creative skills; 
 Assume leadership roles and be self motivated; 
 Be accountable for their learning; 
 Collaborate and communicate with each other; 
 Develop team interaction skills.

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective 
application of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. 
Constructivism means generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with 
personal knowledge that has been constructed from past experiences. “A 
Constructivist is one who believes that the learner is responsible for constructing 
knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for learning must be returned to the 
child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, A Model for the 21ST 
Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think 
about these experiences and their own views and beliefs, they construct personal 
meaning and acquire knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be 
expected to just accept knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by 
the teacher. Instead, they become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is 
encouraged and they discover and decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating 
environments with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to 
explore. The teacher’s main role is to provide experiences that help students make 
connections between what is learned and what they already know or believe. More 
learning takes place when students become active participants in the learning process 
and are “allowed to make their own sense out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions  
that they already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. 
The knowledge that the students construct from the information that they receive as a 
result of these “hands-on” activities makes sense and is easier for them  to relate to 
and apply to their everyday livs and environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base and examine and classify their 
concepts to then provide them with opportunities to share and debate common 
knowledge. They then convert and expand students’ knowledge by asking open- 
ended questions and presenting problems which cause them to gain new 
understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this, they challenge and 
promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times 
when knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and 
explicit way. There are many benefits that can be accrued from utilizing the 
Constructivism Theory, but if it is not used properly, learning may become 
sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be stifled in their 
exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
 
 Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are 
expected to acquire; 
 Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are 
understood; 
 Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
 Provide guidance for the students. 


 
  
 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy. It enables us to better understand 
the cognitive level at which students process information. Students who process information at the higher levels develop critical thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and evaluate. They 
construct new meanings and become original and creative thinkers. Students who process information at the lower levels may not become independent thinkers and may not be empowered to problem 
solve. The list of behavioural terms are as shown.

SCIENCE PROCESS 
Source: The American Association for the Advancement of Science 
 
BASIC SKILLS 
 
1. Observing. Observation is an objective process of gathering data or facts through the use of one or more of the five senses – hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. The 
five senses are used to find out about objects and events, their characteristics, properties, differences, similarities, and changes. 
✦ Observations are recorded. 
2. Classifying. Classification is the process of sorting or grouping objects on the basis of observable traits. When objects share a common characteristic, they are said to 
form a set. 
✦ Lists, tables, or charts are generated. 
3. Measuring. Measuring is the process of expressing the amount of an object in quantitative terms or comparing an object to a standard (metric units, time, student- 
generated frames of reference). 
✦ Measurements are to be recorded in an orderly and systematic fashion with labelled units of measure. Charts, graphs, or tables can be 
generated manually or with a computer. 
 
4. Inferring. 
Inferring is an inventive process in which an assumption of cause is generated to explain an observed event. Inferring takes place when we arrive at a 
conclusion or guess based on what we observe or already know. 
✦ More than one inference may be presented to explain an observation. 
5. Predicting. Predicting deals with projecting events based upon a body of information. It is a belief based on what will occur based upon present knowledge and 
understandings, observations, and inferences. The nature of the skill of predicting is to be able to identify a trend in a body of data and then to project 
that trend in a way that can be tested. Predicting takes place when you tell what you think will happen. 
 
✦ A prediction should be followed by a written or oral explanation to clarify ideas and reveal any misconceptions or missing information. 
6. Interpreting. Interpreting is arriving at explanations, inferences, or hypotheses from data that has been placed in a data table or graph. 


326 
 
7. Communication. This process refers to the systematic reporting of data and may be oral, written or mathematical. It should organize ideas using appropriate 
vocabulary, graphs, other visual representation and mathematical equations. The purpose of the communication skills is to represent information in 
such a way that maximum amount of data can be reviewed with an eye toward discovering inherent patters of association. 
 
8. Hypothesizing. A hypothesis is a response or potential solution to a specific question or problem. 
 
9. Experimenting. This is a systematic approach to problem solving. Usually experimenting is synonymous with the scientific method. The scientific method follows five 
basic steps:

Students need to be taught valuable problem-solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method 
sets out a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing the 
experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/activity will turn out that is based on prior knowledge. Although a 
good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing the 
materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the experiment; 
therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as numbered steps (It 
would help if they be written beginning with behavioural terms). 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data is recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, charts, 
and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data needs 
to be analysed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The conclusion should 
state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new hypothesis based on 
findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, 
which assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by 
specific roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages 
group processing as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and 
employ strategies to ensure that they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students 
are more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is 
important for the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the 
quantity and quality of students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six 
weeks before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student 
should have an opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all 
members realize that they are jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
 Contributing ideas to the group; 
 Listening carefully for ideas from others; 
 Helping the group make good decisions; 
 Cooperating rather than competing; 
 Solving problems in a calm manner.

Student-Centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing science, proactive in the learning process and willing to share and accept responsibility 
for their own learning. Student-Centred Learning activities are adaptive and cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
 Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
 
 Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
 
 Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
 
 Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss and 
problem solve. 
 Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
 
 Students actively participate in decision-making. 
 
 Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning styles. 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
 
 Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
 
 Students must never question the teacher. 
 
 Students only respond when a question is asked. 
 
 Students must remain seated at all times. 
 
 Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
 Students do not participate in decision-making. 
 
 There is very little variation in learning activities

HOWARD GARDNER 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person can be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
❖ Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It may be 
in a person’s native language or another language.  Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
❖ Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature (e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations). 
 
❖ Spatial Intelligence is how people comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may  not see. 
It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind like the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, or the way 
a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence are usually 
painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
❖ Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and perhaps 
manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music -- it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical intelligence 
use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
❖ Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinaesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
❖ Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. People with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can manipulate numbers, 
operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand the underlying principles of 
some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
❖ Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which gives the 


334 
 
person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things  to avoid, and 
which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their limitations and 
know where to go if they need help. 
❖ Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; however, people 
with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and motivations. 
Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the 
interpersonal sphere. 


332 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
People have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their learning and 
ensure higher achievement. 
 
❖ Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information, they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. These 
persons often choose careers in engineering, surgery, design, architecture and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
❖ Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening. They process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk  
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; however, 
they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal of listening. 
❖ Kinaesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinaesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They may 
become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process. 


  
 
 
 
WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
 Whenever we interact with other people, we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 Assessment - whether direct or indirect - is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance 
that describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing, there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually 
taught and what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students with a  
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 Purpose might include: 
➢ 
Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
➢ 
Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
➢ 
Informing parents about progress; 
➢ 
Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students (e.g. when 
students  transfer to a new school or new courses which may have been studied); 
➢ 
Accumulating records of achievement; 
➢ 
Acting as a diagnostic tool (e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken); 
➢ 
Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
➢ 
Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable 
placement may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make 
predications  about likely future performance. 
 
Hence, assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and 
progress of students, providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
➢ 
Informal 
➢ 
Formal 
 
 
Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked up 
by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence, informal assessment is often used 
diagnostically. 
 
It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 With formative (i.e. informal assessment) the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback 
can be confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular 
time)  or can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the 
learner went wrong. 
 Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback 
purposes  because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and 
RSA  Examinations) 
 Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at 
an early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment and projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and the 
keeping of Science journals.

Assessment is a way of providing feedback to the various stakeholders in the education system and a way of communicating the expectations of that system to all concerned.  Data 
generated through the process of assessment provides the students with feedback on how well they are meeting course expectations and teachers with feedback on how well 
students are learning. Assessment allows teachers to determine the effectiveness of the instructional strategies employed in the teaching process. Thus, effective assessment 
practices can drive both instructional strategies employed by the teachers and learning strategies that may be used by students. 
 
National Science Education Standards identified four components of the assessment process: data use, data collection, methods to collect data, and users of data. These components 
can be combined in numerous ways and should be used to inform decision making and actions taken in science education. National Science Education Standards suggested the 
following changes in emphasis in assessment: 
 
Less Emphasis on … 
More Emphasis on … 
Assessing what is easily measured 
Assessing what is most highly valued 
Assessing discrete knowledge 
Assessing rich, well-structured knowledge 
Assessing scientific knowledge 
Assessing scientific understanding and reasoning 
Assessing to learn what students do not know 
Assessing to learn what students understand 
Assessing only achievement 
Assessing achievement and opportunity to learn 
End-of-term assessment by teachers 
Ongoing assessment by students of their work and that of others 
Development of external assessment by experts alone 
Involvement of teachers in the development of external measurement 
 
 
Assessing Student Learning 
Assessing science through paper-and-pencil tests is akin to assessing a basketball player’s skills by giving a written test. We may find out what someone knows about 
basketball, but we won’t know how well that person plays the game. 
(Hein and Price, 1994) 
 
Instituting change in the classroom assessment program can be challenging. It is important for the classroom teacher to remember that new assessment strategies should be 
introduced slowly and carefully, being careful to maintain some traditional testing. A balance of traditional testing and alternative assessments will result in a more complete 
picture of student progress. In addition to traditional testing, the following assessment strategies have been used effectively in many science classrooms: 


338 
 
 
Matched pre- and post-module assessments; 
 
Embedded assessments Prediction activities; 
 
Final assessments, such as hands-on assessments, paper-and-pencil tests, and science notebooks; 
 
Informal assessments; 
 
Documentation and record keeping. 
 
Matched Pre- and Post-Module Assessments 
Pre- and post-module assessments serve two important functions. The first is to track how much students have learned during the unit. The latter enables the teacher to  observe 
how the student’s understanding of a subject has grown. 
 
A pre-module assessment might include a teacher asking a question, assign an investigation, brainstorm, draw a picture, or perform a simple experiment at the beginning of  the 
unit to determine how much a student knows about a given subject. As the class progresses through the unit, the teacher might refer to the pre-module assessment to further refine 
the teaching strategies. The post-module assessment would then be used as a way for the teacher to measure his or her teaching strategies. 
 
Embedded Assessments 
Embedded assessments are woven into the instructional sequence in the module. They may be part of the activities that naturally occur in a lesson or a logical extension of  the 
lesson’s central activity. Embedded assessment allows the teacher to obtain and record information about student learning. 
 
Prediction Activities 
A prediction activity allows the student to predict an outcome based on previous experience and knowledge of a subject. By asking students to make predictions at 
appropriate times, teachers can assess the science concepts their students have mastered and how well they can apply that knowledge to a new situation. 
 
Final Assessments 
Final assessments are used at the end of a science unit or module and can take many forms. Examples of final assessments are described below. 
 
Hands-on Assessments 
Hands-on assessments provide opportunities for teachers to observe how well students can perform an experiment similar to one they worked on during the module or unit.  Through 
hands-on assessments, teachers see how students approach a problem, gather data, record results, and draw conclusions form their findings. 
 
Teachers may also use stations to offer a series of tasks for students to complete. Students may work individually or collectively as a group. 
 
Paper-and-Pencil Tests 
Paper-and-pencil tests are questions used at the end of the unit to assess student knowledge. The questions can be pictorial or reflective. Pictorial questions evaluate how well  a 
student can think through problems that require both the knowledge and the application of ideas to a new situation. Reflective questions evaluate how well students can express 
themselves in writing as indicated by the way they respond to problem-solving questions. 
 
Science Notebooks 


339 
 
Students can be asked to prepare individual science notebooks that include all the observations and records generated during a module or unit. The notebooks may include stories 
and poems, record sheets, charts, tables, and graphs. Drawing also reveals what students have learned. Teachers should assess the level of detail, use of labels, and quality of 
explanations accompanying the drawing. Notebooks also provide an effective way for students to keep records of what they have done in the module. 
 
Informal Assessments 
It is also beneficial to conduct informal assessments of student progress. Informal assessment might include reviewing written materials, observing students at work and simply 
listening to students talk as you stroll around the classroom. By asking the right questions, teachers can uncover students’ reasoning and the steps they used to solve problems. The 
questions that students ask can also provide valuable information about their understanding. Individual and group presentations also provide insight into student understanding or 
interpretation of concepts. Finally, questions posed by students following presentations can provide opportunities to gather important information. 
 
Documentation and Record Keeping 
One of the hardest parts of incorporating alternative assessments into the science program is developing an accurate record-keeping system. Many teacher’s guides include  
record-keeping charts to help teachers focus on the goals of each assessment instrument. 
 
The record-keeping devices may include observation sheets, student worksheets, student profile charts, and evaluation rubrics. These devices provide a structure for 
teachers to use as they experiment with new assessment strategies, and they can be adapted to suit the needs and record-keeping styles of different teachers.

Our students are known as the digital or the information generation. As computers are transforming the way students learn and are making a big difference in the way that  their 
brains process information, we must use information technology to cater to the unique needs of this computer-savvy generation. Computer technology can play a pivotal role in the 
instructional strategies of teachers as they adapt and adjust their modes of teaching to incorporate information technology into their lessons. 
 
As we seek to use information technology to our advantage, we must be forever mindful of the challenges of the information highway and make a comprehensive review of  all 
websites before they are used and recommended to students. Please note that the suggested websites listed below have been reviewed for currency and suitability for students and 
teachers. As the internet is constantly changing, some websites may become non-functional, outdated or unsuitable.

An integral part of a successful science program is conducting laboratory experiments, activities and investigations. Laboratory experiments, activities and investigations can lead 
to accidents or injuries. Prevention is the best cure to reduce the possibility of such accidents or injuries. Preparation and planning are the key to laboratory safety. 
 
Safety should be the priority in preparing and planning every experiment, activity and investigation. The teacher should provide an environment where laboratory safety is always 
considered. While it is not possible to anticipate every accident, a well-planned experiment, activity or investigation will minimize potential. Keys to safety  in elementary school 
science are planning, management and monitoring. Listed below are areas for consideration: 
 
 
Teachers should perform an experiment prior to class presentation to determine any inherent safety issues; 
 
Teachers should model safety procedures at all times; 
 
Teachers should supervise and monitor student behaviour and enforce safety rules and procedures immediately; 
 
Teachers must be present during the entire laboratory session; 
 
Students should understand rules dealing with glassware, electrical equipment, chemicals, fire, sharp instruments and eye safety; 
 
Safety rules should be prominently posted in the classroom laboratory; 
 
Appropriate protective equipment should be provided and worn as required (eye, hand, clothing, etc.); 
 
Teachers should be aware of student allergies; 
 
Safety equipment should be immediately accessible in laboratory/classroom and in working order (eye station, fire extinguisher, ground-fault interrupters (GFI), first  aid 
kit, etc); 
 
Laboratory equipment should be cleaned or sanitized, age appropriate and in working order; 
 
Teachers should understand basic first aid rules in case of injuries; 
 
Proper storage of materials and equipment is required. 


 
Chemical Safety Hazards 
 
Laboratory chemicals pose a potential hazard in the elementary science classroom. Most elementary school teachers are not formally trained in chemistry, yet chemicals are 
sometimes used in their science programs. Listed below are chemicals considered too hazardous for use in elementary science classrooms. 
 
a. Acids: Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid should not be used. Even diluted solutions of these acids can cause skin and eye burns. Two acids generally safe to 
use are vinegar or a weak citric acid solution. When working with acids, always were chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
b. Asbestos: Asbestos should not be used and should be discarded according to school system policy. Some forms of this mineral – commonly used in hear-proofing 
applications – is known to cause cancer. 
 
c. Bases: Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide is an extremely strong base. Even diluted solutions will irritate the skin, and – if splashed in the eyes – may cause  
injury before one can begin to wash the eye out. For acid-base (pH) activities, the teacher should consider sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) when making a basic solution. 
When working with bases, always wear chemical splash safety goggles. 
 
d. Mercury: Mercury compounds should not be used in the elementary school classroom. Any thermometers or other instruments containing mercury have no place in the 
elementary classroom and of which should be properly disposed (mercury thermometers can be identified by their silver-coloured liquid.) When thermometers are needed, 
use alcohol-filled thermometers). 
 
e. Smoke Generating Activities: Smoke of any kind affects the lungs because smoke is composed of particles floating in the air. Any classroom demonstration that produces 
smoke should be done in a fume hood, near an exhaust fan or outdoors with students upwind. 
 
f. Other Chemicals: Teachers should use only those chemicals that are approved for the use in elementary classrooms. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers should communicate the following safety rules to their students and ensure that they are obeyed: 
 
In the Classroom 
 Listen to your teacher for special safety directions. If you do not understand 
something, ask for help. 
 Wear safety goggles when your teacher tells you to wear them. 
 Tell your teacher if something breaks or spills. Move away from it and wait for 
the teachers’ instructions. 
 Be careful around a hot plate, a candle or open flame. Only use these items if 
instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 When heating materials in test tubes, always slant the tubes away from yourself 
and others. 
 Wear safety aprons if you work with anything messy or anything that might spill. 
 Read all the directions before doing experiments or using equipment. Make  sure 
you understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher for assistance. 
 Carefully read the label on the container of a product before you use it; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions and pay special attention to health or safety warnings. 
 Keep your hair and clothes away from open flames. Tie back long hair and roll up 
long sleeves. 
 Keep your hands dry around electrical equipment. 
 Know the location and proper use of the fire extinguisher and first aid kit. 
 Never run or play around in the Science Laboratory classroom. 
 
 Never eat, drink or smell unless you are instructed to do so by the teacher. 
 Never draw any material into a tube with your mouth. 
 Clean up your work area and wash your hands afterwards. 
 Store tools and equipment safely the way your teacher tells you to as soon as  you 
finish using them; do not leave them out where they may be stumbled over. 
 When using liquids or other potentially messy substances, cover work surfaces 
with newspaper. 
 
 
On Field Trips 
 Always be accompanied by a trusted adult like your teacher or a parent or 
guardian. 
 Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s approval. The animal might 
bite. The plant might be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
 Stay with your group and keep within sight of the accompanying adult. report any 
scrapes, cuts and injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
 
Responsibility 
 Treat living things, the environment and each other with respect.

I. “OWL STRATEGY” 
Credit is given to Ansberry and Morgan 2005 for the creation of the OWL Strategy. This strategy is a three-column chart (OBSERVATIONS, WONDERINGS and 
LINK TO LIFE/LEARNING) where students record their observations about a phenomenon or object, their wonderings/thoughts and what they learned as it 
relates  to life. 
 
II. “READ ALOUD” ~ SCIENCE LITERATURE/CONCEPTS 
This strategy is appropriate for all grade levels. Many researchers contend that this strategy improves reading skills and increases interest in reading and literature 
and can improve overall academic achievement. 
 
III. “FRAYER MODEL” 
The Frayer Model is a tool use to help students develop their vocabulary. Frayer believes that students develop a stronger understanding of concepts when they study 
them in relational manner. Participants write a word (e.g. ECHINODERMS) in the middle of a box and proceed to list characteristic, examples, non- examples and a 
definition in other quadrants of the box.  They are encouraged to proceed in any order using the examples and characteristics to help them formulate a definition. 
 
IV. “ALPHABOXES” 
This strategy could be use as a brainstorming activity to elicit student’s prior knowledge and to activate learning, or it could be used at the end of a unit to assess 
what students learned. Students would be given a blank alphabox (with letters from A to Z – see sample handout). They are given a topic (e.g. MATTER) and are 
given a time period to write or suggest a word/phrase beginning with each letter of the alphabet associated with the given topic. 
V. “PUT RHYTHM TO WORDS” 
This strategy could be used to aid students in learning definitions of science words and assessing their knowledge of concepts taught in a lesson/unit. 
This strategy provides the opportunity for participants to be creative. In small groups, participants are provided with five definitions each (e.g. “AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS A PLACE WHERE LIVING AND NONLIVING THINGS AFFECT EACH OTHER.”). They are encouraged to read the definitions, identify key words in the 
definitions, identify the part of speech for selected words in the definitions – (integrating language Arts) discuss meaning and use words in a rhythmic beat so that 
the definition can easily be remember. To assess definition of words, each word of the definition is placed in squares of firm construction paper and cut out 
individually (word puzzle.) The words are shuffled, and participants are given a specific time to put word puzzle in correct order. 
VI. USING MUSIC 
Using music instead of memorization is a technique used to show how science concepts can be taught (e.g. Information on “Bones Found in the Human Body” is  
provided. In small groups, participants use the tune of familiar nursery rhymes and songs to learn basic content on a topic.

VII. 
VOCABULARY WHEELS (by Jane Feber) 
Participants create a moving wheel that was placed within a folded piece of paper which has a small opening cut on both sides. Through the small openings, students 
write science words on one side of the wheel and their definitions on the other side of the wheel. This visual tool which participants can make can be used to test 
vocabulary in science. 
VIII. SWAT 
This is a fun way to review vocabulary. Teachers are encouraged to select an area in the classroom where science words can be mounted (science wall). 
At the end of each unit, the students are grouped into two teams. Each team is provided a light plastic fly swatter. At various intervals two persons (one from each 
team) stand with fly swatter and back to word wall. Remaining students are given the initiative to give the definition of a word on the word wall. The “GO” Sign 
then gives permission for the two individuals to turn and SWAT the correct word for the meaning given as quickly as possible. This game reinforces concepts and 
allow students to have fun while learning. 
IX. FOLDABLES (by Denise White) 
Foldables are great hands-on instructional strategy and more valuable than worksheets. Students can create various styles of foldables using sheets of coloured 
paper.  They can use the foldables for note taking or written activities. 
X. VOCABULARY CHARADE (by Madeline Marcotte) 
This strategy can be used with any age group. The purpose of this technique is to review science vocabulary previously studied. The techniques utilize 
visual/spatial, body/kinaesthetic and interpersonal intelligences. 
 Students are given cards with science vocabulary words (one word per card). 
 Each student is given the opportunity to choose two persons to work with them. 
 A time limit is given for discussion of vocabulary in small groups, and then participants ACT out the WORDS for the class without using oral language. 
 The class observe the ACT and then make an effort to identify the WORD. This technique can be used in conjunction with a visualizing activity in which students 
draw a small picture or symbol next to each word in their notes. 
XI. “CONCEPT DEFINITION MAP” 
The teacher will choose a word or concept which relates to the topic being studied and write it in the centre of the graphic. Keep in mind a few questions: 
1. What is the central word, concept, research question? (e.g. Vertebrates) 
2. What are the concepts? The items, descriptive words or telling questions that you can associate with the concept, topic, etc. (e.g. animals with 
backbones, warm blooded). 
The Concept Definition Map could be used during or after reading of a science passage. It can be used with expository and narrative text.

SOCIAL STUDIES THEMATIC STRANDS 
Culture  
The study of culture prepares students to answer questions such as: What are the common characteristics of different cultures? How do belief systems, such 
as religion or political ideals, influence other parts of the culture? How does the culture change to accommodate different ideas and beliefs? What does 
language tell us about the culture? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with geography, history, sociology and anthropology, 
as well as multicultural topics across the curriculum. 
 
Time, Continuity and Change 
Human beings seek to understand their historical roots and to allocate themselves in time. Knowing how to read and reconstruct the past allows one to 
develop a historical perspective and to answer questions such as: Who am I? What happened in the past? How am I connected to those in the past? How has 
the world changed and how might it change in the future? Why does our personal sense of relatedness to the past change? This theme typically appears in 
courses in history and others that draw upon historical knowledge and habits. 
 
People, Places  
The study of people, places and human environment interactions assists students as they create their spatial view and geographic perspectives of 
and Environments 
the world beyond their personal locations. Students need the knowledge, skills and understanding to answer questions such as: Where are things located? 
Why are they located where they are? What do we mean by “region”? How do landforms change? What implications do these changes have for people? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with area studies and geography. 
 
Individual Development  
Personal identity is shaped by one’s culture, by groups and intuitional influences. Students should consider such questions as: How do  
and Identity 
people learn, perceive and grow? How do people meet their basic needs in a variety of contexts? How do individuals develop from youth to adulthood? In 
schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with psychology and anthropology.  
 
Individuals, Groups,  
Institutions such as schools, churches, families, government agencies and courts play an integral role in people’s lives. It is important that  
and Institutions 
students learn how institutions are formed, what controls and influences them, how they influence individuals and culture and how they are maintained or 
changed.  Students may address questions such as: What is the role of institutions in this and other societies? How am I influenced by institutions? How do 
institutions change? What is my role in institutional change? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with sociology, 
anthropology, psychology, political science and history.  
 
 
 


 
11 | P a g e  
 
 
Power, Authority  
Understanding the historical development of structures of power, authority and governance and their evolving functions in contemporary society 
and Governance 
and other parts of the world is essential for developing civic competence. In exploring this theme, students confront questions such as: What is power? What 
form does it take? Who holds it? How is it gained, used and justified? What is legitimate authority? How are governments created, structured, maintained 
and changed? How can individual rights be protected within the context of majority rule? In school, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing 
with government, policies, political science, history, law and other social sciences.  
 
Production, Distribution, 
Because people have wants that often exceed the resources available to them, a variety of ways have evolved to answer such questions:  
and Consumption 
What is to be produced? How is production to be organized? How are goods and services to be distributed? What is the most effective allocation of the 
factors of production (land, labour, capital and management)? In schools, this theme typically appears in units and courses dealing with economic concepts 
and issues. 
 
Science, Technology and Society   Modern life as we know it would be impossible without technology and the science that supports it. But technology brings with it many questions: Is new 
technology always better than old? What can we learn from the past about how new technologies result in broader social change, some of which is 
unanticipated? How can we cope with the ever-increasing pace of change? How can we manage technology so that the greatest number of people benefit 
from it? How can we preserve our fundamental values and beliefs in the midst of technological change? This theme draws upon the natural and physical 
sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and appears in a variety of social studies courses, including history, geography, economics, civics and 
government.  
 
Global Connections 
The realities of global interdependence require understanding the increasing important and diverse global connections among world societies and the 
frequent tension between national interests and global priorities. Students will need to be able to address such international issues as health care, the 
environment, human rights, economic competition and interdependence, age-old ethnic enmities, and political and military alliances. This theme typically 
appears in units or courses dealing with geography, culture and economics, but may also draw upon the natural and physical sciences and the humanities.  
 
Civic Ideals and Practices 
An understanding of civic ideals and practices of citizenship is critical to full participation in society and is a central purpose of the social studies. Students 
confront questions such as: What is civic participation and how can I be involved? How has the meaning of citizenship evolved? What is the balance 
between rights and responsibilities? What is the role of the citizen in the community and the nation and as a member of the world community? How can I 
make a positive difference? In schools, this theme typically appears in units or courses dealing with history, political science, cultural anthropology and 
fields such as global studies, law-related education, and the humanities.

ASSESSMENT 
1. Define the terms: symbols, 
national pride and 
ambassadors. 
 
2. Identify all national symbols of 
The Bahamas. 
 
3. Compare and contrast the 
colonial symbols of the past 
with the national symbols of 
today. 
Pride is one’s ability to respect 
self, others and country.   
 
It is an awareness of the events of 
history that forms the country we 
know and love.   
 
Each Bahamian must see 
himself/herself as an ambassador 
for and of his/her country. Each 
ambassador promotes his or her 
culture whether at home or abroad. 
 
Prior to 1973, The Bahamas was 
one of many British colonies, 
therefore, the flag and national 
symbols of that time reflected a 
British heritage.  
 
Songs like ‘God Save Our 
Gracious Queen’ was sung to

During the second World War 
(1939-1945) many Americans 
went to Europe to join the troop.  
It was a difficult time for farms 
and factories in the United States, 
as farms and factories lacked the 
workers to be productive.  The 
result was called ‘The Contract’ 
or ‘The Project’.  This was the 
arrangement between the 
governments of the United States 
and The Bahamas to trade 
workers. 
 
Bahamian men and women left 
their homes and families to travel 
and work on the farms and in 
factories in the United States.  
Bahamian workers would send the 
money they earned home to their 
families.

Prior to 1942, labour pays varied

Unskilled workers, at that time, 
earned four shilling or 31 cents for 
men and 2 shilling or sixteen cents 
for women.   
 
In 1942, The Bahamas Federation 
of Labour was established to 
represent general workers in The 
Bahamas. 
 
The Bay Street merchants 
controlled the payment of labour at 
that time.   
 
American workers were paid more 
than Bahamian workers who were 
doing the same job.   
Although, the American company 
was willing to adjust to equal pay, 
the Bay Street merchants forced 
the American company to 
conform.

Global warming is the warming up 
of the earth’s atmosphere. The 
main cause of global warming is 
the greenhouse effect.   
Gases such as oxygen, carbon 
dioxide, nitrogen and hydrogen are 
trapped in the atmosphere.  The 
sun shines and heats these gases to 
form a blanket of warmth and light 
which is essential to earth.  But 
power stations, factories and 
vehicles are making new forms of 
gases.   
These new gases are attracting 
more and more of the sun’s heat 
warming the earth excessively.  
This warming is melting our ice 
caps which will result in increased 
sea levels.

THE ROAD TO MAJORITY RULE (1942 - 1967) By Arthur Dion Hanna - Former Governor-General of The Bahamas 
This singular event in Bahamian history played a significant role in shaping the modern Bahamas we experience today. The significant events leading up and emanating from Majority Rule must 
become permanently etched in the Bahamian historical landscape as these events define us as a people, reveal what we believe in as Bahamians, and serve as a constant reminder of our vision 
and values. Following is a cursory account of the significant events surrounding and leading up to Majority Rule, the meaning of Majority Rule, and homage will be duly paid to the freedom 
fighters that fought this epic battle in the name of freedom and justice.  
The Burma Road Riots  
Many local political historians believe that June 1, 1942 marked the beginning of the modern political history of the Bahamas. The events of the Burma Road Riots came as a result of the 
agitation by labourers for equal pay for equal work, regardless of colour or nationality. As you know, a satellite airfield was being constructed in western New Providence for use by the 
American armed forces. A labour dispute ensued over equal pay and this dispute took on a life of its own and became intimately interwoven with the overall movement for freedom and social 
justice. Today that site is the Lynden Pindling International Airport. So it is clear that from the first stirrings of political activity in the country, labour has been an integral part of the struggle.  
 
The Suffrage Movement in The Bahamas 
The Movement really started with a conversation between Mrs. Mary Ingraham and her husband following his defeat in the 1949 general elections. The defeated candidate opined that his 
political fortunes could have been very different had women voted in that election. Other significant national events that fueled the suffrage movement were the Burma Road Riots of 1942, the 
general strike of 1958, and the labour movement of the 1950s. The civil rights movement in the United States with Dr. Martin Luther King was an international event that also fanned the flames 
that burned for social justice and equality in The Bahamas. Mary Ingraham formed alliances with kindred spirits from across the political divide as Bahamian women and men worked tirelessly 
together to fight racial, political and economic injustice in The Bahamas. This alliance included freedom fighters such as Georgiana Symonette, Eugenia Lockhart, Althea Mortimer, Albertha M. 
Isaacs, Doris Johnson, Grace Wilson, Mildred Moxey, Ethel Kemp, Gladys Bailey, Una Prosper Heastie, Veronica Lotmore, Nora Hannah and Madge Brown. Mary Ingraham was elected as 
President of the Suffrage Movement in 1957. Georgiana Symonette was the Vice President and Eugenia Lockhart was the Treasurer. In 1958, Dr. Doris Johnson returned home from studying 
abroad and joined the Suffrage Movement. During the years 1959 and 1960, the movement gained considerable ground, advancing petitions and demonstrating publicly for the right to vote. In 
November 1960, Eugenia Lockhart and Dr. Doris Johnson accompanied Henry M. Taylor, Chairman of the PLP, to London to present a petition to the Secretary of State for the colonies. In 
January 1961, a Select Committee of the House of Assembly gave a report in favour of the right to vote for women but with effect from January 1963. The PLP and the Independents in the 
House of Assembly opposed the report. An appeal was made to the House of Commons in England again. On February 23, 1961 a Bill to enable women to vote was enacted with effect from June 
30, 1962. Bahamian women voted for the first time on November 26, 1962.  
 
 


 
xxii | P a g e  
The birth of the PLP 
The PLP was born out of a movement that embodied the hopes, aspirations and feelings of a generation of Bahamians who were demanding equal work, majority rule and freedom to pursue any 
hopes and wishes they dared conceive. The man who was generally credited with conceiving the Progressive Liberal Party was William Cartwright, a publisher, real estate broker and Member of 
the House of Assembly for Cat Island. In August of 1953, Mr. Cartwright reportedly invited to the first meeting on Bay and Frederick Streets, the following men: The Hon. Charles Rodriquez, 
Mr. Henry Milton Taylor, Mr. Cyril Saint John Stevenson, Mr. Samuel Carey, Mr. Holly Brown, Mr. Clement Pinder, Mr. F.W. Russell and others. Many black businessmen and lawyers were 
invited to join, but for reasons of their own, decided not to be identified with the new movement. But the party’s course was clear from the beginning; the PLP was designed to represent all that 
was opposed to unfair privilege and the wealth and power this afforded the Bay Street Boys.  
General Strike of 1958  
In support of 1957’s protests, a 16-day general strike brought Nassau to a screeching halt. Unionized or not, just about every worker participated, and the strike was quite peaceful. The result was 
the Trade Union and Industrial Conciliation Act and the setting up of a Labor Department. The General Strike took place in January 1958. Later that year in June, Allan Lennox Boyd, Secretary 
of State for the Colonies ordered that the first constitutional steps be taken toward Majority Rule. The voting franchise was extended to all males whether they were land owners or not; the once 
ubiquitous unlimited plural vote was ordered to be reduced to two and the abolition of the company vote was ordered.  
Women’s Right to Vote 
In November of 1960, Sir Henry Taylor led a delegation to London to champion the right of women to vote in The Bahamas. Accompanying Sir Henry were notables like Dame Doris Johnson 
and Eugenia Lockhart. Shortly after their return, women received their right to vote and exercised those rights during the November 26, 1962 general elections. This new women’s right brought a 
force and element into the history of The Bahamas that affected the country’s social, economic and political development. To this day, the effect of women exercising their right to vote has 
impacted all aspects of national life as women from all sides of the political divide have and continue to make their contribution to the country, holding key positions in many offices throughout 
our country.  
Black Tuesday  
On this day, the governing United Bahamian Party (UBP) sought the approval for a Boundaries Draft Order, which established the boundaries for the various constituencies of New Providence 
and the Family Islands, under the provisions of the 1964 constitution. During a sitting of the House of Assembly, the PLP proposed two amendments to the revision of the Boundaries Draft Order 
which the UBP had presented. The amendments were designed to get a fairer idea of the number of voters and their distribution, but both proposed amendments were rejected. It was at that point 
that Sir Lynden walked over to the speakers’ table and lifted the 165-year-old mace, the symbol of the speaker’s authority and said, "This is the symbol of authority and authority on this island 
belongs to the people and the people are outside.” With that, he raised the mace and hurled it through the open window of the House of Assembly. The Progressive Liberal Party describes this 
event as "an act of deviance in the pursuit of liberty and fairness." So Tuesday 27, April 1965 was destined to go down in Bahamian history as Black Tuesday.

Majority Rule Day 
Some have argued that the great significance of Majority Rule was that after years of struggle by many freedom and justice-loving people, the back of the old oligarchy was finally broken. More 
importantly, Majority Rule presented the opportunity for real democracy to come to The Bahamas, underpinned by equality, tolerance, economic justice, social justice, all important elements in 
the creation of a free, modern, democratic state. All Bahamians benefited, in one way or another, from the historic event that took place on January 10, 1967, a day that now wears the rather 
inelegant appellation of Majority Rule Day. Majority Rule ushered in the opportunity for all Bahamians to have constitutional, political, social, cultural and economic rights. Where these rights 
were not readily accessible, the government of the day created laws and implemented policies to enable these entitlements. January 10th is a day in the national calendar that belongs to all 
Bahamians – not just PLP’s but to all Bahamians, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, city dweller and Family Islander and, yes, PLP and FNM alike. January 10th needs to be 
commemorated and celebrated by all of us because it represents one of the truly great and defining moments in our evolution as a people. With the exception of emancipation from slavery in 
1834 and the attainment of independence in 1973, there is no event of more consequence and historical importance than the attainment of Majority Rule on January 10th, 1967. January 10th, 
1967 represents the transition from the old Bahamas to a New Bahamas; the point of transition from minority government to Majority Rule; the point of transition to a modern democracy. It also 
represents, however, one of the highest pinnacles in the historic – and still ongoing – struggle of the Bahamian people for economic empowerment, for equality of opportunity and for social 
justice.  
January 10th, 1967, to be sure, was neither an end nor even a beginning. Instead, it was an important milestone in a journey that was begun centuries ago when some anonymous slave struck a 
blow for freedom for the first time. We pause to pay homage to the personalities and players in this epic struggle. In a hard fought and competitive election in 1967, the PLP delivered the 
following 18 members to a 38-member House of Assembly. They were: Lynden Pindling, Preston Albury, Clarence Bain, Milo Butler, Clifford Darling, Elwood Donaldson, Arthur Foulkes, 
Carlton Francis, Arthur Hanna, Warren Levarity, Curtis MacMillan, Uriah McPhee, Maurice Moore, Edmund Moxey, Jimmy Shepherd, George Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson and Cecil Wallace- 
Whitfield. Randol Fawkes who successfully ran as Labour in 1962 and 1967 with the support of the PLP, threw his support behind the PLP and became a member of the first Majority Rule 
cabinet. He figured prominently in the movement toward Majority Rule. Successful Independent candidate Sir Alvin Braynen threw in his lot with the PLP and accepted the post of Speaker of 
the House. These two warriors for justice and freedom tipped the proverbial scale in favor of the PLP and the first Majority Rule cabinet was formed: This distinguished group consisted of Cecil 
Wallace-Whitfield, Milo Butler, Arthur Hanna, Clarence Bain, Jeffrey Thompson, Carlton Francis, Randol Fawkes, Warren Levarity, Curtis McMillan, Clement T. Maynard and Lynden 
Pindling. In this 40th year of nationhood, we come together as one people to mark a critically important milestone in our progress as a people – and to re-commit ourselves to a struggle that never 
ends.  As The Bahamas looks to the future, it must be that the average man, making the average salary, with children to educate to university level; that they see not a glass ceiling but 
opportunities that give rise to hope as we work to build the best little country in the world.

Whoy, whoy, whoy, song writing was his game 
Whoy, whoy, whoy, born in Nassau, Bahamas in 1974

(chorus) 
Come round and let me tell you; Come around and let me tell you 
National heroes here and there; National heroes everywhere 
 
It’s really easy, easy peasy; 1967 was a year not to be queasy 
Lynden and Randol, short in stature and brave at heart; They both fought and did their part 
(chorus) 
 
Lynden threw out the mace and brought a change in the black race; Equality for all was the order of the day 
Not by colour, but knowledge earned our pay 
(chorus) 
 
Randol said treat all workers right; Burma Road Riot brought all to light 
Country was shut down until a new era came to town 
(chorus) 
 
Election day came and there was a tie; Randol said I can’t lead in a lie 
He cast his vote and brought an end to this white regime; Bringing the nation to new heights and ending shame

What is Cricket? 
By Shari Briggs, Ashly Ferguson, Shatera McIntosh, Latoya Smith 
(sung to the tune of Who Let the Dogs Out) 
 
Cricket started in our country in 1846. 
It is the oldest sport being played here, 
In the roads, playground or fields. 
 
What is Cricket? 
What is Cricket? 
What is Cricket? 
What is Cricket? 
 
During the 70s the game declined, 
Because teachers did not know the game. 
They taught track and field and other sports, 
Which buried the cricket name.

RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Compiled in 2024 by The Innovation Unit


3 
 
 
PREFACE 
 
 
 
In the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the predominant religion practised is Christianity.  The Preamble to the Bahamian Constitution indicates that the 
preservation of our nation’s freedom is predicated upon a “national commitment to self-discipline, industry, loyalty, unity and an abiding respect for Christian 
values.” Therefore, the Religious Studies Curriculum, at the elementary level, is based entirely on Judeo-Christian teachings and principles.   
 
Religious Studies is a core subject at the elementary level and must be taught as a separate subject or as a part of the integrative process.  The Curriculum is 
based on four strands:  Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and Celebrations/Festivals.  Through these broad strands, key 
concepts, values, attitudes and skills are integrated from Grade One to Grade Six.   
 
In this revised document, there is a greater emphasis on the development of skills that students will need to live successfully as national and global citizens.  
Furthermore, grade level standards and benchmarks are clearly outlined in order to consistently monitor student progress and performance.  The curriculum is 
rigorous but it is designed for flexibility and to encourage creativity.

HOW TO USE THE RELIGIOUS STUDIES CURRICULUM  
 
The Primary Religious Studies Curriculum is presented in four strands: Basic Beliefs and Teachings, Purpose, Values and Community Living and 
Celebrations/Festivals.  These strands are consistent throughout the primary school and provide a basis for the Religious Studies Curriculum at the secondary 
school level.  The strands are covered in the order indicated above; however, topics under Celebrations/Festivals are to be taught in the appropriate seasons.   
 
 
The Curriculum focuses on the teaching of the relevant concepts and skills and development of attitudes that students will need to understand and apply the basic 
teachings and practices of Christianity. All lessons should centre on the development of key concepts, skills and/or attitudes. Key concepts, skills and attitudes 
are highlighted in the Scope of Work. 
 
Key concepts to be developed include: beliefs about God, worship, prayer, purpose, values, community, and culture 
 
Skills incorporated in the curriculum include:  communication, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, interpretation, investigation and application 
 
Attitudes to be developed include:  caring, respect, gratitude, responsibility, enquiry and appreciation 
 
 
The curriculum takes into consideration theories related to the cognitive, physical, moral and faith developmental levels of the learner.  As teachers deliver 
instruction, they must be cognizant of what is developmentally appropriate for the learner.  In particular, James Fowler’s research on the Stages of Faith (See 
Bibliography) should be examined and applied by all teachers. 
 
Research shows that learners acquire concepts, skills and attitudes best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.  The classroom environment 
should foster a high degree of participation and productivity.  Teachers are therefore encouraged to utilize a variety of strategies in order to engage students in 
learning and to cater to their various needs.  The following strategies should be utilized in the classroom:  brainstorming, cooperative learning, discussion, 
role-play, games, written and artistic expression, critical thinking and problem solving. 
 
A wide range of resources is integrated into the curriculum in order to encourage creative, active and student –centred learning.  Further, the integration of 
technology is a key component of the Religious Studies Curriculum.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize the various online platforms and digital resources to 
enhance instruction and engage all learners. 
 
Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and learning process.  Assessment is designed to evaluate not only what students know and can do but their 
attitudes as well.  A variety of assessment tools should be utilized by teachers:  journals, discussion, role play, projects, checklists, anecdotal records, 


29 
 
essays, interviews and structured and open-ended questions. Rubrics are provided in the Appendix to promote objectivity and consistency in assessing 
students’ work.  Teachers should be familiar with the Standards and Benchmarks outlined in the curriculum document as students will be formally assessed 
based on them. 
 
With regard to the primary school timetable, three periods are allocated for the teaching of the Social Sciences in lower primary and two periods for 
Religious Studies in upper primary.  In order to maximize time, teachers should make integration a priority.  Many of the topics in Religious Studies could be 
connected to Health and Family Life Education and Social Studies and in some instances Science.  Literacy skills are also integrated in the curriculum document. 
 
The Pacing Guide serves to keep teachers on target and to ensure that the curriculum is completed in a timely manner.  Moreover, the special needs of students 
will determine the pace of learning.   
 
 
The following example indicates how the curriculum objectives are number:

While on Earth, Jesus Christ taught 
many people through parables. A 
parable is an earthly story with a 
spiritual message or moral.  In the 
parable of the “Prodigal Son,” Jesus 
teaches us about God’s love and 
forgiveness. The 
parable 
also 
teaches 
us 
about 
the 
unconditional love of a father for 
his son and how parents should 
not give up on their children.

Individuals should seek to 
honour the Holy Spirit in their 
daily lives. We honour the Holy 
Spirit by listening to His voice 
as He teaches and guides us.  
We must follow His instructions 
and be obedient. We must do 
what is pleasing to God so that 
the Holy Spirit can dwell in our 
temples (1 Cor. 3:16).  We 
must produce spiritual fruit 
(Gal. 5:22-23). We must also 
honour the Spirit in worship.

The fruit of the Spirit is seen in 
individuals who are disciples of 
Jesus Christ. Galatians 5: 22-23

is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, 
kindness, goodness, 
faith, gentleness, 
self-control. 
Against 
such,

hearing God’s word and believing, 
nurturing a prayer life and never 
giving up. Meekness comes through 
service and knowing who you are.  
Temperance comes when you keep

Scripture.

the lives of biblical 
characters who 
displayed faith,

The Bible gives us examples of 
individuals who displayed faith, 
meekness and temperance. 
Ruth, the Moabite was an 
example of unwavering faith 
and 
bravery. 
After 
being 
widowed early in life, she 
stayed with her mother-in-law 
and followed God the rest of 
her life. David displayed self-
control when he didn’t kill Saul, 
even 
though 
he 
had 
opportunity to do so. Moses 
was called the meekest man 
on earth.  He was slow in 
speech and thought he would 
not make a good leader.  We 
can certainly learn from their 
examples.

Human beings were created 
with a conscience or inner 
sense of right and wrong.  
This helps us to make moral

an individual attempts to do 
something wrong, he or she 
will hear a “voice” telling him 
or her not to do wrong (Isaiah 
30:21)

2.1. A.6.3. Examine 
issues related to 
human equality and 
equity 
 
Even though human beings are 
all equal, they are not treated 
with equity or fairness.  Society 
places people at different levels 
based on their race, nationality 
or wealth.   
 
In some countries, people do 
not have the basic resources 
they need to live a good life.  
Some children live in poverty 
and do not have food, clothes, 
and access to a good education.
 
People must be treated with 
equity and given the resources 
they need to succeed.  We must 
be guided by our conscience 
and do what is right.

areas: 
“God's

Both Harvest and the American 
Thanksgiving 
are 
for 
the 
purpose of giving thanks to God 
for 
the 
harvest. 
God 
commanded Israel to celebrate 
harvest festivals to give thanks 
for their crops. The Pilgrims 
started Thanksgiving in America 
in 1621, after a difficult winter 
the previous year, to celebrate a 
bountiful harvest. 
 
Today, in the Christian church 
we celebrate Harvest by giving 
thanks to God for all of His 
blessings. People bring food 
items to share with the needy.  
Bahamians 
also 
celebrate 
Thanksgiving 
with 
family 
gatherings and the eating of 
turkey and ham.

Sometimes our prayers may not be

unforgiving spirit also hinders our prayers 
(Mark

Unbelief 
can 
be 
a 
hindrance according to Matthew 21:22. 
Improper motives prevent prayer being

create pollutants by throwing garbage 
on the Earth and through their work in 
factories. 
“Pollutants

the 
quality of air, water, and land.” They can 
bring destruction to all living things.

There are many scriptures related to one’s 
spiritual, mental, physical and emotional 
health. Our bodies are living sacrifices 
(Romans 12:1-2) and our minds need to be 
transformed. Our bodies are temples of the 
Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:20). Our spirit is 
to be preserved from being fearful so we 
can trust God’s power (2 Timothy 1:7). We

In Genesis 1:28, God tells Adam and 
Eve to “be fruitful and increase in 
number,” to have children or to 
procreate. In Genesis 9:1-7, the 
same command/blessing, “be fruitful 
and multiply,” is repeated to Noah’s 
family. God desired humans to ‘fill’ 
the earth so that they could rule over 
every living creature and keep it 
under control (Gen. 1:28).

Women in biblical days who were 
unable to reproduce, faced many 
challenges. 
Elizabeth 
was 
an 
example of someone who was 
barren. Because of her barrenness, 
an angel appeared to her husband 
and told him that Elizabeth would 
have a son (Luke 1:5-25). Another 
example was Sarah who faced the 
same contempt from Hagar, her 
maid, who had a child for her 
husband, Abraham (Genesis 21).

“people 
want 
more 
leisure 
time 
and 
personal

Jesus Christ’s suffering and death has 
had tremendous effect on all human 
beings.  Jesus carried our sins in His 
body on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). Because 
of His death all who believe in Him will 
have forgiveness of sins and eternal life 
(John 3:16).  Jesus received many 
stripes so that we could be healed (Is.

Jesus Christ’s resurrection is central

It is important to have respect for the 
laws of God and the laws of society. 
Respecting God’s laws indicates an 
individual’s love, trust and faith in 
God. Society needs laws in order to 
survive. Without laws there will be

The Bahamas is rich in traditions that have 
influenced our behaviour. Character building 
is an important part of our training.  We learn 
to have manners and respect for others, from 
our elders. We are taught to be polite to 
strangers and be a good neighbour. 
Going to church is vital because our nation is 
guided by Christian principles. The Bible 
provides principles for daily living. 
 
Bahamians are great story tellers. Stories 
which teach life lessons have been passed 
down from generation to generation. Stories 
about Brer Bouki and Brer Rabbi are famous.
  
Proverbs are sayings that have been passed 
down 
from 
generation 
to 
generation; 
Examples are: “A boaster and liar are first-
cousins” and “Mad dogs bite the hand that 
feed them” (H.H. Finlay – Eleuthera). We use 
proverbs to guide our actions.

The Holy Spirit impacts people’s lives every 
day. The Holy Spirit works in us by replacing 
our sinful characteristics with the Fruit of the 
Spirit (Gal. 6:22). His work makes us more 
and more like Jesus. Acts 1:8 states that the 
Holy Spirit empowers Christians to be 
effective witnesses for Jesus Christ. He 
teaches believers and guides our decisions 
(John 14:26).  He helps us when we do not 
know what to pray for (Rom. 8:26).

According to the article, “The Importance of 
Culture,” culture is “the lifeblood of a vibrant 
society, expressed in the many ways we tell 
our stories, celebrate, remember the past, 
entertain ourselves, and imagine the future.” 
 It is handed down from generation to 
generation. Across time, various groups 
developed their own cultures, or sets of 
beliefs, and behaviours. People of the same 
culture, societies, or communities had a 
sense of belonging together.

the ways in which 
Christian 
celebrations have 
impacted our 
culture 
 
Christian celebrations have impacted our 
culture in many ways. They have impacted 
our behaviour and traditions. Traditions such 
as going to church services, eating special 
foods, enjoying seasonal music, decorating 
our homes and participating in parades are 
all enjoyed.  Christian celebrations have 
helped Bahamians to be more peaceful, 
joyous, generous and respectful of their 
fellow neighbours and visitors to our country.

by detailed information.  
Main idea is clear, but the supporting 
information is general.  
Main idea is somewhat clear, but there is a 
need for more supporting information.  
The main idea is not clear. There is a 
seemingly random collection of information.  
Accuracy of facts  
(content)  
All supportive facts are reported 
accurately.  
Almost all supportive facts are reported 
accurately.  
Most supportive facts are reported 
accurately.  
No facts are reported or most are inaccurately 
reported.  
  
Introduction  
(Organization)  
The introduction is inviting, states the 
main topic, and previews the structure 
of the paper.  
The introduction clearly states the main 
topic and previews the structure of the 
paper, but it is not particularly inviting to 
the reader.  
The introduction states the main topic, but 
does not adequately preview the structure 
of the paper nor is it particularly inviting to 
the reader.  
There is no clear introduction of the main 
topic or structure of the paper.  
  
Sequencing   
(Organization)  
Details are placed in a logical order and 
the way they are presented effectively 
keeps the interest of the reader.  
Details are placed in a logical order, but 
the way they are presented sometimes 
makes the writing less interesting.  
Some details are not in a logical or 
expected order, and this distracts the 
reader.  
Many details are not in a logical or expected 
order. There is little sense that the writing is 
organized.  
  
Flow & Rhythm  
(sentence fluency)  
All sentences sound natural and are 
easy-on-the-ear when read aloud. Each 
sentence is clear and has an obvious 
emphasis.  
Almost all sentences sound natural and 
are easy-on-the-ear when read aloud, 
but 1 or 2 are awkward or difficult to 
understand.

easy-on-the-ear when read aloud, but 
several are awkward or difficult to 
understand.  
The sentences are difficult to read along 
because they sound awkward, are 
distractingly repetitive, or difficult to 
understand.  
  
Word choice  
Writer uses vivid words and phrases 
that linger or draw pictures in the 
reader’s mind, and the choice and 
placement of the words seems 
accurate, natural, and not forced.  
Writer uses vivid words and phrases 
that linger or draw pictures in the 
reader’s mind, but occasionally the 
words are used inaccurately or seem 
overdone.  
Writer uses words that communicate 
clearly, but the writing lacks variety, punch, 
or flair.  
Writer uses a limited vocabulary, which does 
not communicate strongly or capture the 
reader’s interest. Jargon or clichés may be 
present and detract from the meaning.

MISSION OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
The mission of the Ministry of Education is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that 
will equip them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic society, guided by 
Christian values.  
 
HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) VISION 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit envisions Bahamian communities where people are happier, healthier and more productive. They 
are respected for their individuality and creativity, as they live harmoniously in safe and clean environments. This vision promotes health as 
that state of well-being which goes beyond the absence of diseases and includes the mental, physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of 
all. 
 
Health and Family Education with its focus on the health and well-being of individuals and their families will affect all aspects of human 
development. This Unit plans to expand its programmes and services to cater to the needs of all Bahamian communities. Through collaboration 
with Government Organizations and Non Government Organizations, the HFLE Unit will strengthen programmes and services. These will 
include sensitization and training for stakeholders, promotion activities, production and dissemination of materials.  
 
Recognizing the relationship between health and learning and the need to promote health among students throughout The Bahamas, the Unit 
will coordinate intervention initiatives such as: HIV and AIDS education, nutrition education, character development, conflict resolution, 
substance abuse prevention and adolescent health education to assist in the reduction of lifestyle risks and abusive behaviors, teenage 
pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, drug abuse/use, violence  and poor oral and nutritional habits. 
 
To assess the status of HFLE in The Bahamas, several evaluation measures will be implemented. Moreover, ongoing research will be 
conducted to address the major health problems, concerns and needs of all stakeholders. Priorities will be based on needs assessment. 
 
As we partner with the various stakeholders to address the challenges and demands of everyday life, we will create a stronger Bahamas. 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit will promote positive values, attitudes, behaviors and skills that contribute to healthy lifestyles 
through training programmes, ongoing curriculum development and partnership linkages.

HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION (HFLE) BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. Life is the most valuable, natural possession to be nurtured and protected at all times by everyone. 
 
2. The stabilization of family is the key to the management of most of the social problems. 
 
3. Health is essential to the well-being of all individuals. 
 
4. Academic achievement and student health and well-being are inextricably linked. 
 
5. HFLE, with its emphasis on prevention and multi-disciplinary approaches, has the potential to address many of the social problems and 
impact behaviors and lifestyles. 
 
6. HFLE aims to address the whole child and to nurture emotional, physical, mental and moral development. It takes into account both 
affective and cognitive dimensions of learning. 
 
7. In HFLE, the process of learning is as important as the outcome. 
 
8. HFLE is the means by which positive values, attitudes and behaviors, knowledge and skills can be taught. The core skills, which the 
young develop within HFLE, can be translated into all areas of their lives. 
 
9. HFLE creates an atmosphere of trust, openness, sincerity and honesty, which contributes to positive interpersonal relationships. 
 
10. HFLE draws heavily on the experiences of students and educators and deals with young people in the context of home, school and 
community relationships.  
 
11. HFLE produces individuals who, cognizant of their roles in society, will make a positive contribution to national, regional and 
international development.

OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE 
 
At the heart of the ‘Dakar Framework of Action for Achieving Education for All (EFA) by 2015’, is the vision of every person engaging in 
learning, the key to unfolding their full potential as human beings. Education in The Bahamas is the principal vehicle for promoting the 
development of individuals and the nation as a whole. It is well documented that children and adolescents need to be educated about many 
important social, cultural and health issues in order to fulfill their goals and potential as healthy, productive citizens. Research has also shown 
that confident, well-informed and well-supported young people are better able to make positive choices and decisions.  
 
Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) is a comprehensive, life-skills based programme which is built on the belief that education is “the 
lifelong acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for full personal development and for active participation in society.”  In 
order for individuals to be healthy, they must be knowledgeable about health promotion, practices and disease prevention.  
 
Health and Family Life Education is the primary medium of the school curriculum which delivers information and develops skills to address 
issues and risky behaviours affecting children and adolescents. These issues and risky behaviours include: teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs), HIV, AIDS, child abuse and molestation, unsafe/unprotected sex, chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, obesity), substance abuse 
and drug dealing, negative sub-cultures and crime and violence.   
 
Based on the CARICOM HFLE Regional Framework, the curriculum is divided into four themes: Self and Interpersonal Relationships, 
Sexuality and Sexual Health, Nutrition and Physical Activity and Managing the Environment. The content under each theme is 
interrelated and has been developed interdependently to ensure reinforcement of concepts and show linkages between the various risk factors.   
 
The curriculum is designed to facilitate a more child-centered approach to teaching, incorporating character building and interdisciplinary 
methods. Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of accurate knowledge, skills development and exploration of values and attitudes. Health and 
Family Life classes afford students opportunities to build competencies for healthy self-development to deal with the challenges of life as well 
as make positive contributions to national, regional and international development. 
 
Finally, the activities and ideas presented in this document are not exhaustive.  You may be able to find many more to match the lesson topics 
and the specific objectives.  Please feel free to do this and share your ideas with other teachers for the enrichment of the programme and the 
development of our children.

Aging is a part of the natural cycle of life. (Review Grade 
4, Standard 2.1: the Human Life Cycle). 
 
As people age, they may have to adjust to physical 
limitations (hearing loss, paralysis, blindness), mental 
dysfunction or social adjustment (loneliness, empty nest).  
 
People are worthy of love, care and respect no matter what 
their age or condition of health.  
 
Society can provide support and services for individuals as 
their physical, mental and emotional abilities decline with 
age. 
- Family members can provide support as caregiver, friend, 
adoption, etc.  
- Children and teens can find opportunities to become 
  involved in the lives of older adults e.g. volunteering at  
  senior citizens homes or daycare, advocating for 
  enforcement and changes to laws that protect the 
  rights of senior citizens.   
Level 1: Design a poster to discourage 
discrimination against older adults.

TEACHING AND  
EVALUATION STRATEGIES 
In order to understand what sex is all about and how pregnancy 
occurs, it is important to know the functions of the male and female 
reproductive systems.  
 
Male Reproductive System   
The male sex organ is the penis.  Behind the penis is the scrotum, 
which is a skin sac that holds the two testicles (also known as testes) 
that make sperm and the male hormone, testosterone.  
 
Once a young man starts puberty, his body is able to make sperm.  
From this point on, he is able to get a female pregnant.  The sperm 
are made in the testes (testicles).  The testes also produce the male 
hormone, testosterone.   
 
After sperm are made, they travel through tubes in the epididymis, 
where they mature and are stored.  If the sperm are not ejaculated 
from the body, they will be reabsorbed.  During sexual arousal, the 
sperm travel through the vas deferens to the prostate, where fluid is 
added. The fluid plus sperm makes up semen.   
 
Level 1:  Define vocabulary 
words from the lesson

functions of the male and female 
reproduction systems

Ejaculation is when this semen comes out of the penis 
through the urethra during sexual activity.  Only 
semen (no urine) is released during ejaculation. 
When a man becomes aroused, the penis fills with 
blood and stiffens.  This is known as an erection.  
During puberty, young men begin an erection while 
they sleep and release semen.  This often called a wet 
dream. The clinical name is Nocturnal Emission.  
 
Female Reproductive System   
The female reproductive system contains a uterus, 
ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, Clitoris, labia and 
vagina. 
 
The ovaries produce eggs and hormones called 
estrogen and progesterone.   
The fallopian tubes are connected to the uterus.    
The fallopian tubes pick up the eggs produced by the 
ovaries.

The uterus is a thick muscle and houses the baby before birth.   
The cervix is at the base of the uterus.  Its job is to hold the baby 
inside the uterus until the baby’s birth.   
The clitoris is located in front of the urethral opening and contains 
sensitive nerve endings.   
The labia are the skin folds around the urethral and vaginal openings 
The vagina is the tubular opening from the uterus to outside the body 
through which the baby travels when it is born.  The vagina is also 
where sperm from the penis are deposited during sexual intercourse. 
 
At puberty, the ovaries begin to release eggs and menstruation 
(monthly periods) starts. The uterus builds up its lining with extra 
blood and tissue to provide protection for a fertilized egg to grow into 
a healthy baby. 
 
If a sperm from the male does not fertilize the egg, it passes through 
the vagina along with the extra blood and tissue from the uterus as a 
menstruation period, which usually lasts from 5 to 7 days.

Child Exploitation involves taking advantage of a child. It is a form 
of abuse and is against the law. Article 36 of the UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child provides protection from any kind of 
exploitation to everyone under18 years.  
 
Two forms of exploitation are: Pornography and Social Networking. 
 
Pornography is any visual depiction (photographs, films, videos, 
pictures, computer generated images or pictures) made or produced to 
exploit an individual in sexual acts or in a lewd manner.  
 
Impact of Pornography 
- Child prostitution 
- Early exposure to sexual activity 
- Abnormal views of sex 
- Little trust for adults 
- Suicidal behaviors 
-  Loss of focus/withdrawn, low self-esteem and feelings of  
   worthlessness 
 
 Level 1: Create a slogan, 
bumper sticker or flyer to 
demonstrate awareness about 
exploitation and pornography.

One of the basic human needs is food. Food is important to life.   
 
The kind of foods eaten and their nutritional value have direct effect on 
one’s health and well being. Therefore, it is important to eat healthy foods.   
 
Food choices are influenced by the following factors: 
- Location (Where people live)   
- Cultural patterns and social interaction: (traditions festivals, 
homecomings, family gatherings,  ) 
- Eating habits (bingeing, overeating, hunger)   
- Accessibility (Income, purchasing power) 
- Availability (local production, imports)  
- Advertisements   
- Food preparation (Fried, baked, jerked, boiled) 
 
No one food gives all the nutrients that the body needs to stay healthy, so it 
is best to eat a variety of different foods everyday.  
 
The foods that make up the daily food requirement should be low in fat and 
high in vitamins, minerals and fiber.  
Level 1: Identify the factors 
that influence an individual’s 
food choices.  
 
Level 2: Trace the changes

extra fat and skin on meat products should be trimmed and low fat 
cooking methods such as baking, roasting and broiling should be chosen.  
- Foods eaten should include: the correct serving from the food groups 
(a serving is the standard amount that is listed for each food and is used 
to help give advice about how much to eat or to identify how many 
calories and nutrients are in the food).  
 
Explain the nutritional needs of individuals based on age, sex, activity 
level and state of health.

Human beings are made up of different shapes and sizes. Body image 
includes the way people see themselves as well as the way they 
believe others view them.   
 
During adolescence, children become more concerned about their 
appearance. (Review puberty in Theme II Sexuality and Sexual 
Health)  
 
Factors that influence body image 
- Self-esteem and self-acceptance: Feeling good about self promotes 
  a positive self-image.   
- Social pressures: People try to change their appearance to become 
  popular or to look like others   
- Cultural beliefs and practices: Body size (In some cultures, being  
  fat is unhealthy, whereas people from other cultures believe the  
  opposite), physical appearance, hair, skin colour, etc.  
- The media often promotes ‘the perfect body’ in advertisements,  
   magazines, on TV, etc.   
- The pressure to conform with society’s rules and norms can  
  increase a person’s health risk 
Level 1: Identify the factors that

people need to maintain good health.  These include: 
clean water, fresh air, animals, trees, plants, adequate 
and safe shelter, nutritious food, physical activity and 
exercise.   
 
Clean water is important for drinking, bathing and

Animals provide various sources of food, clothing, 
shelter and companionship. 
 
Trees and plants – provide food, homes and shade for 
people and animals and give off oxygen that helps them 
breathe. 
 
Some resources are renewable – they replace themselves 
naturally. Some resources are non-renewable – once 
they are used up they cannot be replaced.

Renewable resources: 
Renewable resources are part of nature and form our eco-systems (living 
and non-living organisms). 
Renewable resources include: oxygen, water, forests, plants, fruits, 
vegetables and animals. These resources are renewable as long as they 
are monitored, protected and conserved.  
 
Renewable resources are endangered by industrial development 
(agriculture, large scale fishing, mining and manufacture) and growth 
(population expansion, migration, buildings and road construction). 
  
Renewable resources must be used carefully so that they can renew 
themselves 
 
Non-renewable resources: 
A non-renewable resource is a natural resource which cannot be 
produced, grown or generated; once depleted there is no more available 
for future needs.  
 
Non-renewable resources include: fossil fuel e.g. coal, natural gas and 
petroleum (crude oil); minerals e.g. copper.

APPENDIX II 
 
 
TEACHING AND EVALUATION STRATEGIES  
 
 
The primary focus of Health and Family Life Education is to empower children and adolescents to make life-enhancing choices; and to assist in 
combating the negative influences affecting their health and well-being. In HFLE classes, the emphasis is on the acquisition of life skills, 
values and attitudes required for full development and active participation in society.  
 
Students in Health and Family Life Education classes are not evaluated by the conventional examination methods used in other subject areas. 
However, teachers are expected to evaluate students’ performance throughout the year using various assessment strategies and submit 
grades which will contribute toward the student’s GPA.  
 
The following evaluation strategies are recommended, but should not be viewed as exhaustive in addressing the needs of students.  
 
• Participatory Methodologies (encouraging students’ input into the learning process and into designing new materials) 
• Quizzes 
• Projects (encouraging creative expressions) 
• Research – surveys, photo research, etc.  (providing key information) 
• Pretests and Posttests  
• Portfolios (organizing key information ) 
• Games (developing critical thinking / problem solving skills) 
• Written and Verbal Expression – events planning, advice columns, decision-making, interviews, discussions, debates, panels, etc. 
(sharing thoughts feelings and opinion) 
• Artistic Expression – displays, collage, edutainment (drama, dance and music), etc. 
• Role play (developing critical thinking/problem solving skills) 
• Field trips 
• Internships 
• Community Services 
 
Assessment Procedures 
 
Students are assessed based on the following: 
 
Class work and Homework   
60% 
 
Projects and Portfolios  
 
40% 


 
96
 
Health and Family Life Education Resource / Information Centre 
 
Each classroom should have a resource or information centre in which information on health issues and students’ work are displayed. Health 
and Family Life materials and activities can also be incorporated into the learning centres in primary schools. 
 
Listed are some suggested resources that will make Health and Family Life Education classes more interactive and interesting: 
 
• Computer Software 
• Transparencies on health issues   
• Games and Puzzles  
• Reality dolls 
• Puppets 
• Posters / Charts 
• Videos, DVDs and Audio Cassette tapes on health issues 
• Pamphlets  
• Brochures  
• Guest Speakers  
• Media sources  
 
Health and Family Life Education Services 
 
The Health and Family Life Education Unit provides the following services in New Providence and the Family Islands. 
 
• Workshop and sensitization sessions for teachers, parents, students and the public 
• Resources on health issues 
• Peer leadership training 
• HIV Prevention and Basic First Aid training  
 
Partnerships 
 
The Health and Family Education Unit collaborates with parents, school personnel, Government and Non-Government organizations to provide 
wholesome programmes for students. These activities are designed to help them gain the required knowledge, skills, values and attitudes so that 
they will graduate from the education system as fully functioning, self-confident, responsible individuals.

APPENDIX III 
 
 
BEST PRACTICES: A GUIDE FOR TEACHING HEALTH AND FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION 
 
 
1.   Make the lesson meaningful by establishing the purpose for the lesson and how it can be applied to students’ everyday experiences. 
 
2. If your class period is 50, 60 or 70 minutes, the expectation would be to cover two lessons not drag out one lesson to fill up the time. 
 
3. Allow time at the conclusion of the lesson to reinforce life skills, positive values and attitudes. 
 
4. Make lessons age/language appropriate. If necessary, teachers should interpret the lesson so that student can understand. 
 
5. Keep small group work to the limited time frame. Tell students that it’s ok if they didn’t get everything done before time was up. There will 
be time for further discussion as a class. 
 
6. Ensure that curriculum guidelines, schemes of work and resources are available and are utilized in the classroom. 
 
7. Ensure that Health and Family Life Education is taught on a weekly basis to reinforce concepts, positive values and life skills.  
 
8. Ensure that topics are taught in sequence as outlined in the curriculum for each grade level. 
 
9. Integrate health concepts in other subjects such as Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Religious Studies. 
 
10. Incorporate in your lessons, teaching/evaluation strategies that are students centered, innovative and participatory e.g. cooperative learning, 
role play, games, research, experiments, edutainment (drama, dance, and music), field trips, etc. 
 
11. Provide student activities that demonstrate application of life skills e.g. critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, communication, 
negotiation, assertiveness and cooperation. 
 
12. Ensure that grades are recorded in the mark book for the topics taught (date, topic, and number grade) 
 
13. Establish interactive learning centres in the classroom which should include current teaching aids and samples of students’ activities.  
 
14. Create instructional and motivational bulletin boards/charts that reflect the concepts and skills being taught e.g. family patterns, body parts, 
hygiene, drug abuse prevention, conflict resolution, HIV, AIDS STIs,  nutrition, environment issues, self esteem, teamwork, etc.

This curriculum has been developed to assist in the dissemination of Physical Education activities and techniques.  It is hoped that this curriculum will assist all 
practitioners of the subject, especially our colleagues in the Family Islands, to improve their delivery of the subject.  It has been said that “the greatest gift that can be given, 
is the gift of knowledge” (author unknown). 
 
It is the hope of all of the professionals who assisted in the compilation of this work, that it will be a source of inspiration and a valuable tool in the tool-box of knowledge 
and instruction to all Physical Education instructors.

RATIONALE 
 
Physical Education is the nucleus of healthy lifestyles and caters significantly to the physically educated citizens. 
It is through this medium that an invaluable learning experience unfolds, allowing all learners to access the knowledge, skills and attitudes that shape their lives through 
this active learning process. 
 
This process of learning embraces the values placed on life and secures each individual in his personal experiences, as these experiences coincide with the stream of things, 
both cognitive and physical in every pursuit. 
 
We must continue to be cognizant of the fact that the needs and experiences of our youth must not be ignored in our planning, for it is through their experiences and 
enjoyment of movement that they will find Physical Education enjoyable.  Regular physical activity is pertinent to the development of the “whole man “.  For children, it is 
through this kind of physical activity and movements that they zoom in on their lives as a whole, critical to all aspects of their development, including the psychomotor, 
cognitive and affective domains.  Therefore, the well-being of individuals depends greatly on the soundness of the Physical Education programme. 
 
In the structured Physical Education programme, consideration must be given to the level of safety of the learners, so as to provide a nurturing environment that would 
enable the development of functional levels of activity, including specific motor skills and functional physical fitness.  The learners Physical Education experiences and 
development must be geared towards appropriate values, personal and social behaviors. 
 
In summary, each individual learner should be progressively assessed in order that their needs are met, providing the opportunity for all to partake in these unique 
experiences equally. 
 
It must therefore be observed, that Physical Education should not be confused with the activities of private sports clubs, sports organizations, or inter-school athletic 
competitions, because these function only to complement this process.  Physical Education is a structured well-balance programme which provides the physically educated 
persons with exciting experience from the knowledge of its nature, skills and developed positive attitudes from its practice; engendering daily routines and leisure pursuits 
through life. 
 
A well-structured and vibrant physical education programme is essential in our Nation as we are in pursuit of excellence.  This active learning will foster personal growth of 
the individual through Physical Education, therefore enhancing the skills necessary to meet the challenges of an ever-changing society. 
 
Thus, an investment in the Physical Education of our children is an investment in the long-term health and prosperity of our Bahama land for years to come.

PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
 
The new direction of Physical Education at Primary level is to provide all students with a safe, enjoyable and nurturing environment where physical activity and the 
development of motor skills will be enhanced.  Each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her potential through the acquisition of knowledge, and skills 
that will transfer to a healthy lifestyle and lifelong sports.  The base of the Physical Programme is Body Management Competence, which gives focus to the development of 
fundamental skills that lead into specialized skills training.  Primary students will also participate in the core sports such as Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, Soccer 
and Track and Field.   Interschool competitions take place in all of the “core sports” aforementioned including, Mini- tennis.  It is the responsibility of the New Providence 
Primary School Sports Association in collaboration with the Department of Education and the various Sports Factions to organize and conduct the competitions, 
reinforcing the principles of fair play, sportsmanship and self-control.

CONTENT STANDARDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
 
1. Demonstrates competency and proficiency in movement forms. 
The intent of this standard is to develop competence and proficiency in movement.  In preparation for adulthood, students should have acquired the basic skills to 
participate in a wide variety of leisure and work- related physical activities and advance in at least two or three areas. 
 
2. Apply movement concept and principles to learning and development of motor skills. 
This standard concerns the ability of the learner to use cognitive information to understand and enhance motor skills.  By graduation the student should have developed 
sufficient knowledge and ability to independently use their learned behavior to acquire new skills while continuing to refine existing ones. 
 
3. Exhibits physically active lifestyles. 
The intent of this standard is to establish patterns of regular participation in meaningful physical activity.  This standard should connect what was done in physical 
education classes with the lives of students outside of class. 
4. Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 
This standard is for the student to achieve a health-enhancing level of physical fitness.  Student should be encouraged to develop higher levels of basic fitness and 
physical competence as needed for many work situations and active leisure participation.  Students should have both the ability and the willingness to accept 
responsibility for personal fitness leading to an active, healthy lifestyle. 
 
5. Demonstrates responsible personal and social behaviors in physical activity settings. 
Achievement of this standard includes safe practices, adherence to rules and procedure, etiquette, cooperation and teamwork, and positive social interaction. 
 
6. Show respect for differences among people in physical activity settings. 
The intent of this standard is to develop respect for individual similarities and differences through positive interaction among participants in physical activity.  
Similarities and differences include characteristics of culture, ethnicity, motor performance, disabilities, physical characteristics (strength, size, and shape), gender, race 
and socioeconomic status.  
 
7. Recognize that physical activity opportunities are for enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. 
As a result of these intrinsic benefits of participation, students will begin to actively pursue lifelong physical activities that meet their own needs.

ASSESSMENT 
By the end of  grades  5  - 
6,  students will be able to: 
 
-Recap from grades 3 and 
4 
 -      Demonstrate concern 
for the care and safety of 
others and for equipment. 
 -      Demonstrate basic 
gymnastic skills in a 
simple routine on floor 
and apparatus. 
- 
Create patterns and 
combinations of 
movements into 
repeatable sequences. 
- 
Demonstrate balance 
and control on a 
variety of moving 
objects (e.g., balance 
boards, skates etc.). 
- 
Create a variety of 
body actions to move 
into and out of a 
variety of transfers of 
weight from feet to 
hands with large 
extensions e.g. 
stretching legs wide; 
torso twisting; rolling; 
curving feet over to 
Recap from grades 3 and 4 
 
1.  TRANSFER OF WEIGHT 
a.    Rocking from one body part to  
       another. 
b.    Rolling from one body part to  
       another 
c.     Feet to hands – head up when  
        moving onto equipment, arms     
        take weight first. 
d.    Spring takeoffs (Flight) – Jump    
       from one foot to two feet; push    
       off the balls of the feet, soft   
       landings. 
 
ii. BALANCING 
a.  Base of support- the higher your  
     center of gravity from the ground  
     or equipment the more difficult it  
     is to balance. It is harder to balance  
    when  your bases of support are far    
    away  from or outside your center      
    of 
gravity. 
Counter-balance 
involves  
     a wide base of support and pushing  
    against each other. Counter-tension  
    involves a narrow base of support  
    and pulling away from each other. 
b. Static- tight muscles keep the center 
of gravity over base of support. 
c.  Dynamic- keep the center of gravity  
 
1. Provide opportunities for students 
to explore different movements on 
the mats individually and in groups. 
 
2. Use stations and task cards to 
help students create routines. 
 
3. Have students review a DVD or 
videotaped performance of a 
gymnast. Watch it once without 
stopping, then rewind and stop at 
various points to initiate discussion. 
Emphasize techniques performed in 
class. 
 
4. Have students balance in pairs, 
using given examples of counter 
balance and counter tension. Ask if 
they can move while pushing or 
pulling against each other. Then ask 
them to try in groups of three or 
four. E.g. 1. Sitting back to back 
with elbows joined, stand up and sit 
down without moving the feet.  
 
5. Have students face their partner, 
palms against each other at shoulder 
level, inch the feet away from the 
center. How far can they get 
without falling?

Show weight transfer 
from feet to hands 
over low equipment 
e.g. boxes, crate and 
beam. 
- 
Demonstrate weight 
transference in various 
ways off low 
equipment or 
apparatus into floor 
level, starting with 
hands on floor. 
- 
Demonstrate the use 
of balances to move 
smoothly into and out 
of different transfers 
of weight. 
- 
Demonstrate a spring 
take off and then 
transfer weight from 
the feet to hands onto 
low-medium 
equipment apparatus – 
beam, bench, table, or 
large tire. 
- 
Demonstrate weight 
transference onto low 
to medium level 
equipment by placing 
the hands on 
equipment and 
springing off from two 
feet landing on hands 
and feet or knees. 
     over bases of support.. 
d. Inverted- tight muscles, behind up. 
     Keep the center of gravity over the    
      bases of support. 
 
ROTATION - rolling, turning, 
cartwheel 
 
 
6. Partners holding each other’s 
wrists, with feet close together, can 
they shuffle the feet sideways and 
move in a circle? 
- 
Challenge students to transfer 
weight from their feet to hands 
in a variety of ways on 
 the ground. 
 
6. GOLDEN NUGGET #1: 
During an obstacle 
course/circuit work the 
teacher will place a long 
jump mat with numbers on 
them . This will be use as 
station for jumping skills by 
practicing a forward and 
backward jump for distance. 
The teacher will explain 
that the jumping/landing 
skill is inherent to proper 
body control and that the 
backward jump task is the 
first step in teaching a back-
hand spring. This 
propulsion in a backward 
plane is an important part of 
the skill. Landing is a vital 
part – If a student is off 
balance in a backward 
motion, it will give the 
student an opportunity to 
learn how to fall properly 
and incorporate another 
lead up skill (back roll , egg 
roll, shoulder roll ) all skills

 1. One Hand -Cartwheel -    Students are expected to keep their legs fully astride throughout this movement and do not allow their body to lean  
                      forward at the start or finish of the exercise. The student should perform a cartwheel in a straight line, on the floor, and on  
                      a bench or low beam using one hand. The students should be able to do 5 consecutive Cartwheels.  
  
 2. Forward Roll -  Students should demonstrate the proper way to tuck their head down while pushing in a forward motion with their legs. They  
                     should be sure to keep some weight supported with their arms. Students should recover by standing up without pushing on     
                            the floor with their hands. The students should be able to do 5 consecutive rolls.  
 3.  Backward Roll – Students are expected to place their hands flat on the floor with fingers towards their shoulders as they roll back to a stand  
                       doing backwards rolls consecutively down an incline mat. The students should be able to do 5 consecutive rolls.  
  
 4.  Handstand – This skill can be reached with students standing as tall as possible. The student should be stretching upwards towards the  
                      ceiling and staying hollow. Students should walk around on your hands whenever possible for 5 to 10 seconds. 
 5. Handstand to Forward Roll - This skill can be reached with students transferring their body from a handstand into a forward roll. Students  
                        should hold the handstand for 5 to 10 seconds before transferring into the forward roll.  
  
 6. Back extension – Students will perform back extensions by standing and transferring weight by reaching for the ground, watching their  
                     toes the entire time and keeping their head in and body hollow. The student should kick the legs up just short of handstand  
                     and roll forward, to a crouch position. Students should be able to do 5 back extensions.

1. DRIBBLING  
a. Dribbling – Ball in front and out to 
side of the body, firm flexible wrists. 
b.  Speed dribble using left/right hand 
(Cross over, between/through the legs) 
 
2. PASSING 
a.     Bounce pass- hands to side, behind 
the ball, push the ball out and down. 
b.     Chest pass- pushes ball away from 
your chest, step toward your partner or 
target. 
 
3.  SHOOTING 
a. Pushing hand is behind, toward 
bottom of the ball, your other hand 
supports the ball at the side, extend arms 
up and out. 
b. Make a lay-up in the basket using 
either hand. 
4.  PIVOTING 
 
a. A player cannot move once he receives 
the basketball.  However, he can pivot on 
one foot, right or left.  That foot must 
remain in contact with the ground at all 
times until the player decides to dribble 
or pass the ball off.

In small groups (2-on2, 3-on-2, 2-
on-1), students on offense use 
dribbling and passing to keep the 
ball away from defenders. Allow 
the players to make up their own 
rules. When it is appropriate, 
discuss the offensive and 
defensive strategies of creating 
and denying space, and why these 
are important.

LONG JUMP 
- 
The key to an effective successful jump is how high 
the jumper can raised his or her center of gravity. 
- 
Long Jump is performed on a Long Jump runway, 
which is normally 40 meters in length and 1.25 
meters in width. 
- 
The jumper’s landing area is called a “Pit” which is 
located at the end of the Long Jump runway.  It is 
usually 3 meters wide and filled with soft damped 
sand. 
- 
The “Pit” with the take-off board should be level 
plain 
- 
There are two types of Long Jump techniques used 
in elementary schools.  These  are: 
(c ) Standing Long Jump 
(d)  Running Long Jump 
 
STANDING LONG JUMP 
- 
This type of jump is made with both feet. 
- 
The arms are brought back and driven in an upward 
vigorous thrust in order    to propel the body upward 
and forward. 
 
RUNNING LONG JUMP 
- 
A  short run is needed

The high jump bar should be at a height that 
concentrates on techniques rather than height. 
 
There are two basic jumping techniques used.  
These are: 
(a) Scissors 
(b) Fosbury Flop 
 
Both techniques require the jumper to run-up, 
take-off, flight and land. 
 
 
SCISSORS JUMP 
 
GATHER 
The take-off is by the leg that is further from 
the bar.  The rear leg is lifted and goes over, 
followed by a leaping moment by the rear leg.

102
The jumper approaches the high-jump bed at a 
35 to 40 degree angle. 
 
The jumper must lower his center of gravity 
and lengthen his strides during his last step on 
approaching the high jump bed. 
 
 
TAKE-OFF 
The take-off  foot should be ahead  of  the 
jumper’s center of  gravity 
 
The take-off foot lands heel first  
 
Both arms are pulled back. 
 
The free leg is unbend and swings vigorously 
upward before the take-off foot loses contact 
with the ground. 
 
FOSBURY  FLOP 
Run-Up 
The jumper approaches the high jump bed in a 
curved manner. 
 
The last three to four strides are shorter than 
in a straddle jump. 
 
The feet follow a path more parallel to the 
cross bar. 
 
TAKE-OFF

- 
The trunk of the athlete is lowered and the heel of 
the supporting leg is lifted slightly off the ground. 
 
GLIDING PHASE 
- 
The athlete vigorously extends his right leg while 
driving back from the sole and then to the heel.  
- 
The left leg is strongly kicked back to the stop board 
- 
The right foot is turned anti-clockwise as it leaves 
the ground while the left foot reaches for the ground 
near the stop board. 
- 
Both feet land on their soles 
- 
The trunk leans back and the weight is carried on the 
right leg. 
 
FINAL PHASE 
- 
The right foot and knees are turned to the front 
facing the stop board of the Shot Putt circle 
- 
Drive the hips forward and upward as the legs are 
being extended 
- 
The body weight is evenly distributed between the 
feet

- 
Students partner up and 
gently toss a ball to 
different places around the 
court to a partner who must 
move in position to bump 
pass or overhead volley the 
ball back to the tossed.  
After five tosses – students 
switch roles.

PRACTICAL VOLLEYBALL SKILL TEST 
 
 
Parallel line is drawn through the middle of the court.  Each half is further subdivided into three equal areas by lines drawn parallel to the sidelines.  This gives six areas 
numbered 1 - 6 and which compares to the playing stations.  Each student is allowed one attempt to serve the ball into each of the six areas in turn.  Two points are awarded 
for serving into the designated court area.  One point is given for missing the designated area. 
 
 
Bumping 
 
 
 
- 
Keep it up, Repetitious hitting 
 
 
Bumping for accuracy passing  
- 
To a setter or hitting a prescribed target.  
 
 
Court layout for service testing 
 
 
Wall volleying – Player stands behind a line four (4) feet away from a wall.  A line representing the height of the net is drawn on the wall about six and half feet (6.5) up.  
Players are asked to make as many volleys as they can in one (1) minute.  If a student steps over the line in a volley, or if the ball goes lower than the mark on the wall, that 
volley does not count.  This test can be administered for the underhand pass (bump) and the overhead pass (flick). 
 
 
Simplified serving-- Students stand in the normal serving position behind the line on any side of the court.  The score is the number of successful serves out of ten trials.  
Each serve that clears the net counts as one.  
 
 
Underhand and Overhead Services 
 
- 
Serving to a spot on the court to demonstrate accuracy. 
- 
Children demonstrate correct techniques in both forms of serving 
Emphasis on: 
- 
Body Positioning 
- 
Proper contact with the ball

- 
Proper arm motion 
Overhead pass 
viii. 
Children demonstrate correct body positioning and striking technique to correctly perform an overhead pass.  They pass the ball to one another in small 
groups. 
 
The Bump 
ix. 
Children bump the ball from different positions demonstrating proper techniques. 
x. 
Bent knees, straight arms with contact point between elbows and wrist. 
xi. 
Keeping the ball up using the bump for a number of continuous hits; bumping a tossed ball.  Number of attempts 5 - 10 
 
Setting 
-     Children demonstrate proper setting techniques.  They are divided in sets of threes: one receiver, a setter and a spiker.  Each child gets a chance at all three positions. 
 
Rules of the game 
xii. 
Children demonstrate that they understand court positioning by placing number cards in correct positions on the courts. 
xiii. 
They respond to questions on court size, heights of net, number of players, points, line violations.

Use the arm as a guide as you throw the ball 
over the right shoulder towards a fielder, 
wicket keeper and the stumps.  Opposite 
action for left hander. 
Step with foot opposite to the throwing hand.  
Throw the ball waist height to the receiver. 
 
Catching    
Observe the ball from above the head into the 
cupped shaped hands close the hands on 
contact and pull it towards the body. 
 
Bowling 
Step forward with opposite foot and hand as 
you bring the ball from waist level with a 
straight hand and release just above the 
shoulder level.  
Bowl to hit the stumps. 
Fielding 
When fielding a rolling ball kneel with one 
knee on the ground and the other at right 
angle to help block the ball.  Hands are 
cupped together in contact with the ground to 
get the ball effectively. 
When running to field the ball, if one cannot 
get to the proper fielding position, use the 
foot to stop the ball from reaching the 
boundary for extra runs.  Never step over the 
boundary when catching a ball or the 
opposing team will get the extra runs. 
 
- 
Children run designated distances 
from box to box known as a safe zone.  
First on command and secondly to 
avoid being tagged with a soft sponge 
ball e.g. Children are divided into two 
teams.  The first team is divided into 
the two boxes.  The second team is 
scattered around the designated play 
area.  The team in one of the boxes 
throws the ball anywhere into the play 
area; the children must run from one 
box to the other without being tagged 
with the ball.

while batting. 
 
Running between the wickets 
 
As a batter hits the ball and it appears that a 
run can be made, he runs to the opposite end 
sliding his bat into the cease, as does his 
partner.  After hitting the ball the batter must 
keep the bat in his hand while running 
between the wickets, the bat must be 
grounded as he reaches the crease at the 
opposite end until the foot reaches the crease 
 
Wicket Keeping 
The wicket keeper must always wear 
appropriate pads and gloves  to prevent the 
balls not hit by the batters  passing him to go 
for runs. 
Catches all balls he can get to within his 
range. 
Stumps the batter out should he be out the 
crease as he receives the ball in the rear of the 
stumps. 
 
Scoring 
A run is scored when both batters cross over 
and reach the opposite crease before a fielded 
ball is thrown and hits the stumps.  You may 
score more than one run when running.  This 
depends upon the amount of times the batters 
cross over and reach their crease successfully.

Should a ball be hit and rolls along the 
ground to the boundary before being fielded 
or even if it comes in contact with the fielder 
and rolls there, this is scored as four runs and 
there is no need to run. 
Should a ball be hit and makes no contact 
with the ground before going in the back 
boundary, it is scored six runs. 
 
Extra runs: 
 
If a bowler’s front foot lands in front of the 
crease as he delivers a ball, it is called a “no” 
ball and scored as one, four or six as hit by 
the batter. 
Should a bowler deliver a ball out of the 
batter’s range, it is called a wide ball and can 
be scored as one run or four runs should it 
reach the boundary. 
 
Byes 
If a ball is bowled, the batter makes a play, 
misses it and it passes the wicket keeper, the 
batter can run for as many runs as possible; 
should it not hit the boundary, it can only be 
scored as four runs. 
 
Leg Byes 
Should the ball hit the batter’s pad while he 
attempts to hit it, he and his partner may run 
as many runs as possible, providing it does 
not hit the boundary to be scored as four 
runs. 
 
Placing the ball when batting, the batter has 
the option to hit the ball in any direction.  He

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them with the 
necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an independent, ever-changing world. 
Visual Arts Unit 
Vision 
We envision an art education programme in which all students in The Bahamas are guided toward literacy, an appreciation of Artists, craft persons, and Bahamian 
culture. We also envision an art education programme that is comprehensive and will nurture the spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, creative, imaginative, aesthetic, 
social and physical wellbeing of the child. 
Mission Statement 
Our mission is to advance art education through appropriate curriculum, teacher development programmes, stimulating environments, the provision of materials and 
relevant information. By doing so, we provide students with learning experiences that focus on their creative development, aesthetic appreciation, critical thinking and 
cultural awareness as well as inter-disciplinary integration. 
Belief Statement 
Art education is beneficial to all students regardless of social, ethnic, economic or educational background. Art is an integral part of the overall educational development 
of the student as it compliments and unites other disciplines while promoting visual literacy skills, imaginative thinking and visual communication. 
We further believe that: 
• Art education provides students with the means to think critically, experience, and understand the world around them in unique ways. 
• Art enables students to become self-directed and lifelong learners. 
• Art provides learning opportunities of varying abilities. 
• Art education enhances the ability to interact in society by developing creative problem solving, inquiry, and communication skills, and by providing an avenue 
for self-expression and multiple points of view. 
• Students develop attitudes of appreciation, self-worth, joy in the creation of artworks, and in viewing the works of other students and artists. 


4 
 
 
 
• Art is a way to appreciate the beauty and value of the environment and the preservation of our heritage. 
• Art provides opportunities to exhibit in classrooms, schools, art centres and museums, sharing the art curriculum with the community, teachers, students, and 
examiners. 
• Art education increases awareness of career possibilities, promotes entrepreneurial skills and highlights our community’s visual resources. 
• Art education reflects and influences the cultural, social, political and economic aspirations and concerns of our society. 
• Art is a way to appreciate differences and promotes cultural, social and ethnic similarities.

Lines 
• Recognize that 
various kinds of 
lines enable an 
artist to express 
ideas. 
• Distinguish between 
an outline, a contour 
and a gesture

of artwork on Lines 
Outline 
 An outline is the line or group of lines 
that define a shape or figure. 
Contour Lines 
Contour lines describe the shape of an 
object and include interior detail. 
Gesture Lines 
Gesture lines are drawn quickly and 
are used to lay in the structure of a 
form. It describes movement and 
direction.  
When an artist wants to show distance 
and depth he or she uses a technique 
called Linear Perspective. For example, 
in a picture of a road, the artist would 
use parallel lines that seem to meet or 
come close together in the distance.

Abstract Art 
Abstract art is not about realism, it’s 
about shapes, colours and feelings.  
Abstract art shows what an artist feels 
and thinks, and not what he or she 
sees. An abstract artist uses colours 
and shapes to express his or her 
emotions and ideas.

is used in artworks 
Colour 
Artists use colours very carefully in 
their artwork. Artists may use the 
colour wheel to plan a colour scheme. 
For example primary colours or 
complementary colours. Artists choose 
colours that portray their moods or 
feelings.

Value 
• Produce work with a 
variety of tints and

to transform a two-
dimensional shape 
Recognize light and dark 
Value tells us how light or dark a 
colour can be.  Add white to a colour to 
make it light and add black to a colour 
to make it dark. When black is added 
to a colour it creates a SHADE. When 
white is added to a colour you create a

(e.g., circle to a 
sphere). 
• Use contrast (light 
and dark) 
expressively in an 
original work of art. 
• Experiment with

degrees of colour 
intensity 
• Use various colours

how the change of 
light direction 
determines the 
value and the 
appearance of 
objects 
• Create still life’s

shadows and 
highlights to depict 
the idea of the 3rd 
dimension on a 2-
Dimensional flat 
surface. 
TINT. White is the lightest value; black 
is the darkest. Value is important to 
drawing and painting, value changes 
are what creates contrast. Contrast 
helps us understand 2-D artworks.  
Shading, Shadows and Highlights 
Shading is adding light and dark 
values to a drawing. To get darker 
values with a pencil you press harder, 
to get lighter values with a pencil you 
press softer. Black is the darkest value 
and white is the lightest value. 
There are three basic shading 
techniques, hatching, cross-hatching 
and stippling. 
Shadows are created when an object 
comes between the light and the 
surface the object sits on. Shadows are 
always opposite the light. A highlight 
is an area where the light hits the 
object directly. Highlights are the 
lightest value. 
Monochromatic  
A monochromatic piece of art shows 
one colour with black or white added 
to it. Mono means one.

• Create a drawing, 
using varying tints, 
shades, and 
intensities. 
Pattern, Rhythm & 
Movement 
• Recognize patterns 
around them 
• Describe a pattern 
• Examine how artists 
use patterns as a 
form of expression 
• Compare and 
contrast lines, 
shapes and colours 
used by artists to 
create artwork.

patterns using a 
variety of media 
• Perceive and 
describe rhythm and 
movement in works 
of art and the 
environment. 
• Create a piece of art 
emphasizing rhythm 
and movement, 
Patterns  
Patterns can be found everywhere in 
our daily lives, on tree leaves and 
trunks, waves, butterfly wings, 
seashells and lots more. 
These are created by repeating lines, 
shapes and colours. The part 
that is repeated is called a 
motif. Patterns can be regular or 
irregular.  
Rhythm in Visual Arts 
Rhythm in art shows movement or 
action. We get a rhythm in art through 
repeating lines, shapes, colours, and 
more. Rhythm creates a mood like 
music or dancing. The best example of 
movement in art is Vincent van 
Gogh’s The Starry Night, which takes 
your eyes on a rollercoaster ride 
around all the twists and swirls. 
Visual Rhythm  
This is a rhythm you get through your 
eyes rather than through your ears. 
Visual rhythm is 81created by 
repeated positive shapes separated by 
negative spaces. 
A good visual rhythm will lead your 
eye through the artwork.

Regular Rhythm 
This happens when an artist repeats 
the spaces between lines, colour, 
shapes, forms and the other elements 
in their artwork using the same size 
and length. 
Flowing Rhythm 
Flowing rhythm describes an artwork 
that contains curved or circular 
elements that give the art movement. 
Some flowing rhythm examples 
include flowers, clouds, or waves. 
Flowing rhythm is when organic 
shapes are repeated in an artwork. 
Movement 
Visual movement is the way your eyes 
travel through an artwork. Artists 
create visual movement through 
implied lines, colour combinations 
emphasis and repetition. 
Our paints cannot physically move, but 
we can paint in a way that gives 
the illusion of movement. This means 
that an artist would arrange shapes in 
a way that would lead the viewer’s 
eyes from one point to the next in their 
paintings, or use certain brush 
techniques to mimic the movement. 
 
 
Texture 
Texture  
Everything has some type of texture.

The way something feels when it is 
touched or the way something looks 
like it feels. Textures can be rough, 
smooth, and bumpy, fuzzy, silky. For 
example, a piece of wood feels rough. 
Artists create texture in their artwork 
to show how objects might feel 
Tactile Texture can be touched and 
seen.  
Visual Texture is a texture that can be

the characteristics 
of Mannerism 
 
Mannerism 
“Mannerism is a style of art that was 
created in the 
Late Renaissance period, from about 
1520 until about 1600. The Mannerist 
style of painting or sculpture often 
shows figures that are "elongated" 
(made longer) and "distorted" (made 
into strange shapes"). The aim of the 
Mannerist artist was usually to make 
art that looked "elegant". The 
Mannerist style began in Italy, where 
the artists were influenced by the 
figures that Michelangelo painted on 
the ceiling and in the "Last Judgement" 
in the Sistine Chapel. During the 
Renaissance, artists like Leonardo da 
Vinci and Raphael had tried very hard 
to learn from nature and to paint 
things in a very realistic way. These 
two famous painters both died around 
1520. Many artists then decided that 
they were going to use the art of 
painting to "express themselves". They 
were not going to follow the rules 
of anatomy and perspective in the way 
that Leonardo and Raphael did. 
Mannerist paintings are often full of 
figures that seem to be twisting, 
writhing or fighting. The faces of the 
figures often show strong emotions

El Greco – “The Greek” 
“Paintings by El Greco are known for 
their brilliant colours and strong 
contrasts of light and shadow. El Greco 
also stretched out the figures in his 
paintings. Their bodies and limbs are 
unusually long, thin, and muscular. 
Although El Greco was Greek, he lived 
much of his life in Spain, where he 
became the first great master of 
Spanish painting. 
El Greco was born in 1541 in Candia 
(now Iráklion), on Crete, an island 
south of Greece. His original name was 
Doménikos Theotokópoulos. Not much 
is known about his early life. In the 
1560s he travelled to Italy, where he 
studied the painting style of Italian 
artists of the period. While in Italy he 
acquired the nickname El Greco, which 
means “The Greek.” 
El Greco left Italy for Spain in the late 
1570s. He settled in Toledo, Spain, 
which was then a religious and 
cultural centre. He created many 
religious paintings for the city’s 
Roman Catholic churches and 
monasteries as well as for private 
clients. The Burial of the Count of 
Orgaz, completed in 1588, is 


86 
 
 
 
considered his masterpiece. It shows 
saints in heaven watching the funeral 
of an important man. El Greco also 
painted several portraits. 
El Greco died in Toledo on April 7, 
1614. He remains one of the world’s 
most admired painters.” Britannica

Space 
Space is determined by where an 
object is situated; It can be created 
using colour, shapes and values. 
Positive  
This is the object being drawn like an 
apple or a car. 
Negative 
This is the space that is left empty. It is 
the space around and between objects. 
Horizon Line 
The horizon line is the horizontal line 
that separates the earth from the sky 
or the sky from the sea. 
Vanishing Point 
The point where parallel lines meet. 
Background 
The part of the picture that is furthest 
away from you. The objects here are 
very small and the colours are very 
dull.

 Frida Kahlo grew up in a house called 
La Casa Azul with her parents and six 
sisters. That house is now the Frida 
Kahlo museum.  As a child, Frida loved 
to draw. At age 6, she caught a disease 
called polio which damaged her right 
leg. 
Initially studying medicine, Kahlo 
changed her career path following a 
serious accident. As part of her 
recovery, Kahlo underwent thirty-five 
operations but she kept painting. Her 
mother had a special easel made for 
her so she could paint in bed, and her 
father lent her his box of oil paints and 
some brushes.  
Frida often painted portraits of 
herself. She wanted to show people 
about her suffering, her inability to 
have children, and also the people in 
her life. She created one hundred and 
forty-three paintings, and of these, 
fifty-five are self-portraits.” Sofia

who was two years older. Because of 
his nearsightedness, Auguste 
struggled in school but seemed to find 
contentment while drawing. Largely 
self-taught up to the age of 13, he 
began his formal schooling at the age 
of 14 at Ecole Imperiale Speciale de 
Dessin et de Mathematiques, where he 
studied painting and drawing. For the
