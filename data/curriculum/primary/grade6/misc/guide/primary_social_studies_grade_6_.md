          Prior to 1973, The
Bahamas was one of many
British colonies, therefore, the
flag and national symbols of
that time reflected a British
heritage. 
         Songs like ‘God Save Our
Gracious Queen’ was sung to
show pride and commitment to
the colonial the monarch.
               The Bahamas was an
independent nation and for the
first time displayed to the
world its own national flag and
symbols. March on Bahamaland
an anthem by the late Timothy
Gibson, became the National
Anthem of an independent
Bahamas.

The crown above the crest of
the coat of arms depicts our
monarch link - with the palm
and conch shell symbolic of the
natural vegetation and marine
resources respectively. 
National Symbols represent
their countries. Sometimes
they are similar in color in their
region. 
They are also different in many
ways they represent each
country’s uniqueness. 
The Bahamas, although
independent, remained a part
of the Commonwealth of
Nations as did many other
British colonies. 
The United Nations are the
maintenance of international
peace and security, the
promotion of the well-being of
the people of the world.
The crest is set on a base which
spells the national motto of
The Bahamas written by Hervis
Bain.

THE CONTRACT
THE CONTRACT
          During the second World
War (1939-1945) many
Americans went to Europe to
join the troop. 
        Bahamian men and
women left their homes and
families to travel and work on
the farms and in factories in
the United States. 
      ‘The Contract’ or ‘The Project’. This was the
arrangement between the governments of the United
States and The Bahamas to trade workers.

     The working people of The Bahamas
withdrew their labour and
demonstrated by marching from the
area known as Oakes Field between the
airport site of that day to Bay Street.
The Riot Act was read.
     This action led to the
Burma Road Riot of 1942.
      In 1942, The Bahamas Federation of
Labour was established to represent
general workers in The Bahamas. The
Bay Street merchants controlled the
payment of labour at that time. 
      American workers were paid more than
Bahamian workers who were doing the same
job. Although, the American company was
willing to adjust to equal pay, the Bay Street
merchants forced the American company to
conform.

        When people are not able to find jobs
that match their skills and abilities, they
are more likely to be unemployed and live
in poverty. This can lead to social unrest
and instability.
           Unions are effective for bargaining
and handling worker disputes because
they give workers a collective voice. This
means that workers can come together to
negotiate with employers as a single unit,
rather than as individuals. This gives
workers more bargaining power and
makes it more likely that they will be able
to achieve their goals.

          In many countries,
including The Bahamas, there are
two types of laws. They are
common law and statue law.
Laws can also be subdivided into
civil and criminal laws.  A
government decides when a new
law is needed. It ensures that the
law is not unconstitutional.
      The intended new law is
called a bill. A bill is brought
to parliament by a member.
During the second reading,
the bill is discussed or
debated.
     At the end of the debate,
during the third reading, a
vote is taken.
          It is then passed to the
senate for final approval, where
the same process occurs. When
the bill is approved and signed by
the Governor General, it becomes
an act of parliament. The Royal
Bahamas Police Force and the
Royal Bahamas Defence Force are
organizations that help to
enforce the law.
     In The Bahamas, both the
British and Bahamian government
agreed to the constitution of The
Bahamas in 1972 making that
constitution the basis of all laws in

        Many schools of thought caused
the discovery of the new world. 
1. The world was flat and heading west
would mean falling off the end of the
world.
2. Traveling west would create a new
route to India the world primer export
country at that time.
3. Our history tells us the landfall of
Christopher Columbus in 1492 helped
the European community to discover a
new world. 
1492
     The Lucayans (Arawaks) were the
native inhabitants of the Bahama
Islands before the land fall of
Christopher Columbus on the island
of San Salvador (Guanahani) in 1492.
During the 1400 Europe which is
considered the world, had no idea
new lands existed west of the
continent. 
1400
     By 1700, Pirates took over these
islands. They attack ships carrying
merchandise, stealing the goods and
selling them. The group were said to
have destroyed the islands’ reputation
until Woodes Rodgers the first Royal
Governor came to The Bahamas from
Britain to rid the islands off piracy.
Under his leadership, the islands
organized its first formal government.
As The Bahamas became more
organized, and new country would
soon immerge. America’s fight to gain
independence from Britain sent
another group to the shores of The
Bahamas.  
1700
GRADE 6
         History tells us of what has happened in the past. A long
period in the past. A time line is an outline of dates and stories of
history. 
         After Columbus’s arrival, many people
would find refuge on these islands. These
included: 1. Eleutheran Adventurers 2.
Pirates 3. Loyalist 4. Slaves. Each group
would affect the islands either positively or
negatively, hence contributing to the story
of The Bahamas as we know it today. 
        After the arrival Woodes Rodgers a new
era seem to begin in The Bahamas. It
became an organized society which would
eventually lead to an independent
Bahamian Society. All of the historical
stories from the Lucayans to pre
independence confirm that change begins
with a single idea. The idea of a person or
group can lead to an event that changes the
future a country and the world.
Christopher Columbus believed the world
was round. This idea led to his journey
westward in 1492, where he by chance
discovered the new world.

1684
     In 1684, the Eleutheran Adventurers
came to the Bahama shores in search
of Religious freedom. They inhabited
island of Eleuthera naming it along
with many settlements. After much
hardship, the adventurer sailed to
Virginia in the United States
requesting food and supplies for the
island. This venture established the
first link to the united Stated which
would be strengthened by other
groups later in history.

BAHAMIAN HISTORY PRIOR TO INDEPENDENCE 1973
      This increased the African heritage
already existing in The Bahamas from
the slave trade and the period of
slavery. 
     Africa lies to the east of the Bahama
Islands on the other side of the
Atlantic Ocean. Today’s Bahamian
descends from the Kongo Kingdom
which lay south of the Kongo River.    
     This tribe shares a common
understanding with the Bahamian
culture. 
    The Loyalist or Tories settled on
these islands from the United States
to remain loyal to Britain.
    They built many churches,
established the first newspaper and
organized law and order in the
community. They bought along with
them many slaves. Freed slaves from
America also chose these islands as
their new home. 
       Burma Road Riot
       Burma Road Riot Prior to 1942,
workers pays varied according to sex,
race and nationality. 
Unskilled workers at the time made four
shillings or thirty-one pence for men and
two shillings or sixteen pence for women.
In 1942, The Bahamas Federation of Labor
was established to represent workers in
The Bahamas. This action led to the
Burma Road Riot of June 1942. The
working people of The Bahamas withdraw
their labor and demonstrated by
marching to and demonstrating on Bay
Street. The Riot Act was read. Five days
later, workers reported back to work, with
an increase in wages established. The
makeup of the Bahamian society prior to
1973 consisted of the white political and
social elite classes and the vast colored
population.

       Both cultures share understanding
that people should relate to one
another. Both cultures insist that
children should respect and yield to
elders, and strangers should be treated
with unwavering hospitality. 
     Our history has been affected not
only by the African culture, but by the
people who came to our islands long
ago. The slaves who worked and lived
in The Bahamas established some of
the older communities such as
Adelaide, Fox Hill and Bain’s Town.

       After the settlement of these
islands and the development a colonial
Bahamas was established, the new
ideas of its occupants would initiate a
new historical change called
independence. The Bahamas seemed to
follow the trend of the region as other
neighboring countries had already
obtained their independence from the
European countries that ruled them. A
series of events in Bahamian Political
history would pave the road to
independence. Independence is the
move to self governance.

       West of Africa is the continent of
South America. Covering half of that
continent is the country of Brazil. Brazil
is known for its cultivation of Coffee,
rainforest and carnival. The carnival
celebrations seem to mimic our
Junkanoo, as groups compete for prizes.
Costumes, dancers and set the theme for
the parade are participants take to the
streets late at night until early the next
morning. 
Moving North west off South America in the
Pacific Ocean lay the islands of Japan. Like The
Bahamas, this country is made up of many
islands. 
         Unlike the Bahamas, Japan has few natural resources therefore depend
heavily on manufacturing as its major industry. The Bahamas imports lots
of its cars, watches and electronics.
       East of the continent Africa is the
continent, island, country of Australia.
Although in different hemispheres, the
same line of latitude that runs through
The Bahamas also runs through the
northern part of Australia. The life style
of the Aborigines people of Australia
resembles that of the Lucayans that
lived in The Bahamas long ago.
