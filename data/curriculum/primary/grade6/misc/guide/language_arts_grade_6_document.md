PREFACE 
 
 
Several strategies were employed to assist with the framing of the new Primary Language Arts Curriculum.  The process began 
with a review of curriculum documents that were produced in various jurisdictions. These countries included Jamaica, the 
United Kingdom, the United States (Florida, Arizona, Illinois), Canada, and The Bahamas (1982 and 1999 guides). The 
documents from these countries were examined to determine the composition of the curriculum teams, their rationale and 
philosophy, the level of integration of Sub-Goals, the design or format used for the Scope and Sequence as well as the Scope 
of Work.  During the actual writing of the curriculum, additional documents from Scotland, South Africa and several other 
countries were referenced, in addition to the standards for the National Council for the Teachers of English and the Ministry of 
Education’s Draft Standards and Benchmarks produced in 2001 by Dr. Linda Davis.  
 
Opportunities were provided for local stakeholders to provide input. Surveys were conducted with teachers throughout The 
Bahamas to ascertain what they wanted to be included in the new guides.  A total of one hundred and sixteen (116) teachers 
throughout The Bahamas responded.  Discussions were also held with three classes of students to get their feedback about 
what they wanted to learn and the types of learning activities they enjoyed.  Additionally, a focus group was conducted with 
members of the community that included business owners, parents, and those who interact with students in after-school clubs 
and sports. 
 
This document was completed with the assistance of two sets of teams that operated several years apart.  The core team 
consisted of seven primary school teachers, one preschool teacher, and a high school teacher.  Additionally, representatives 
from the University of The Bahamas and the Ministry of Education’s Examinations and Assessment Section provided feedback.  
Opportunities were also provided for several Family Island teachers to submit content and activities through the Education 
Officers on their islands. 
 
It is expected that, because of the comprehensive nature of the document, teachers will be able to spend less time engaged in 
research and lesson planning and more time focused on differentiating instruction to meet the needs of their students.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
The revision of the 2022-2027 Curriculum Guidelines would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of a 
number of committed teachers, officers, administrators, and community stakeholders.  The Language Arts Unit is especially 
grateful to the Curriculum Team members who worked long hours to ensure that this document was completed.  Special 
acknowledgement is given to Verona Seymour (deceased), who served as Assistant Director of Education for the Primary 
Curriculum Section before she retired.  She was an excellent Language Arts teacher, an outstanding Language Arts Officer, 
and a wise and supportive supervisor.

VISION 
 
Our vision is for a Bahamian education system that will foster academic excellence and equip students with multiple literacies, 
enabling them to make meaningful contributions as nation builders who are globally competitive. 
 
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of the Department and Ministry of Education is to provide all persons in The Bahamas an opportunity to receive a 
quality education that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and skills required for life, both in a 
democratic society guided by Christian values and in an interdependent and changing world.

BELIEF STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. the learning environment should be student-centred; 
2. at each grade level, students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the succeeding grade level; 
3. all students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, interests and abilities; 
4. students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason, and make decisions as well as develop self-confidence 
and greater freedom of expression; 
5. all students should acquire essential survival skills, enabling them to function well in society; 
6. technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. the methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and learning strategies employed in the 
curriculum; 
9. student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community support; 
10. thinking, speaking, listening, reading, and writing are equally important aspects of the Language Arts Programme and 
should be reinforced in all subjects. 
11. The Language Arts Curriculum should expose students to a variety of literary forms, which would equip them with the 
necessary skills to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze these forms.

RATIONALE 
 
 
The Bahamas is said to enjoy a literacy rate of about 95%.  This statistic is based on the number of students completing sixth 
grade.  Although this does not speak directly to their levels of performance, it is paramount that the education our students 
receive at the primary level lays a solid foundation on which successive grades can build.  This will ensure that students can 
take advantage of opportunities to carve out a decent life for themselves and their families.  
 
Language Arts focuses on communication skills.  During this period in our history, knowledge of basic communication skills is 
essential to our survival as we experience the depersonalisation of everyday services.  More and more people are being 
pushed to use online services for the completion and submission of applications, to conduct banking transactions, to pay bills, 
to make travel arrangements, to access government services, and so much more.   Additionally, changes in technology 
demand that we move away from the traditional ways of communicating.  Landlines, that only required listening and speaking 
skills, have been replaced with smartphones and computers that allow us to communicate via WhatsApp, update our statuses, 
send emails, post digital resumes, read information on the internet, buy tickets, post to social media, create blogs, conduct and 
participate in meetings from anywhere in the world, and so much more.  All of this poses the question of what new ways of 
communicating will be developed next. 
 
Although the answer to this question is unknown, there needs to be confidence that our education system will prepare students 
to communicate effectively, despite the changes that occur.  Recognizing that Language Arts skills are the foundation of all 
learning, the Department of Education’s new Primary Language Arts Curriculum focuses on producing students who are not 
only independent learners and critical thinkers, but also students who possess the ability to communicate effectively in a rapidly 
advancing technological world.  Students are encouraged to express themselves creatively, collaborate, and problem solve as 
we work to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Goal 4, which speaks to ensuring “inclusive and equitable quality education 
for all…”  By focusing effectively on the three core areas of Oracy, Reading, and Writing, teachers will have in their hands the 
tools to equip students with the fundamental skills that they will need to become lifelong learners and to navigate successfully in 
an ever-changing world.

TEACHING FROM THE LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM 
 
 
1. It is expected that the Language Arts Curriculum will guide classroom instruction.  To ensure standardisation, teachers 
should familiarise themselves with its contents and should refer to it often, as they plan their lessons.   
 
2. Teachers should look for opportunities to integrate skills across the Language Arts strands and the content area subjects 
and have students apply these skills authentically in both the physical and virtual contexts. 
 
3. The Language Arts Curriculum should also be supported by a learning environment where students’ curiosity and senses 
are continually piqued through stimulating discussions, challenging questions, physical and virtual field trips, exposure to a 
wide variety of reading materials, interactive and attractive instructional charts, challenging games, interactive learning 
centres, etc.   
 
4. Standards and Benchmarks are supplied for each grade level to provide teachers and parents with a guide for what 
students are expected to be able to do after a year of instruction at a particular grade level.  This information should be used 
to monitor students’ progress throughout the year. 
 
5. The Scope and Sequence identifies the content and skills to be covered for each grade level.  It also indicates the level of 
proficiency at which students should be performing.  Once students have become proficient in a particular area, teachers 
should find ways to continually reinforce their learning. 
 
6. As teachers plan their lessons, some of the objectives in the Scope and Sequence may need to be adjusted to make them 
developmentally appropriate.  The objectives state what students should be able to do at the end of the course of study.  
Teachers should be guided by the content, which indicates what students should know or be able to do.    
 
7. The Language Arts Curriculum is divided into three Sub-Goals: Oracy (Listening and Speaking), Reading (Phonemic 
Awareness, Phonics/Spelling, Fluency and Comprehension) and Writing (Handwriting, Grammar, and Written 
Composition). 
 
8. Many of the topics in the Language Arts Curriculum are repeated from year to year.  Each successive year builds on the 
previous one with more depth to the content and rigour in the activities.  The suggested activities are divided into three 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 25 
 
categories:  basic, intermediate, and advanced.  Depending on the level of students, teachers can access content and 
activities at their grade levels or other grade levels, as they find it necessary.  
 
9. Currently, there are no periods allocated on the timetable for Listening and Speaking and Reading Fluency.  Teachers 
are asked to incorporate the objectives from these areas as part of their morning routines, as well as to integrate them into 
the other Language Arts Sub-Goals and across the content area subjects.  A range of opportunities should be provided for 
students to practice what they have learned in a variety of settings and with various audiences.  They should engage in 
collaborative conversations with partners in small and large group settings.  ZOOM, TEAMS, and other virtual platforms 
make it possible for conversations and collaborative projects to be organized with students in other schools, districts, 
islands, and other countries once the necessary safety protocols have been put in place.  
 
10. Efforts should be made to improve reading fluency rates through guided reading and one-on-one sessions with students.  
Records of students’ oral reading progress should be kept and maintained.     
 
11. There are some Language Arts skills that are connected to more than one of the Sub-Goals.  To avoid duplication in the 
curriculum document, skills generally appear only once in the areas where they can be best applied.  It is expected that 
once skills are taught, students will be encouraged to incorporate them across the strands and that they can be assessed 
across the Language Arts curriculum.  
  
12. Students should be taught Language Arts skills in the context of relevant/appropriate literature.  This particularly refers to 
reading and written composition where the focused skills and techniques should be highlighted.  Students are to be exposed 
to different types of literature and the various Language Arts skills should be taught through teacher read-alouds and 
independent readings.  Below is a list of suggested reading for each grade level. 
 
                     Grades 1 and 2 – Nursery Rhymes, Fairy Tales, and Bahamian Fables  
                     Grades 3 and 4 – Bahamian and Caribbean Stories and Poems, Mysteries, Classics, and Biographies  
                     Grades 5 and 6 – Classics, Myths, Historical Novels, and Science Fiction 
 
13. Reading strategies should be utilized to assist students in navigating texts.  They should be utilized before reading, during 
reading, and after reading. 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 26 
 
14. Comprehension skills should be taught moving from the concrete to the abstract.   
 
                     Visual  
Listening 
        Speaking   
    Reading             Writing 
 
Introducing the skills in this manner means that students who may be challenged in reading still have opportunities to 
understand the skill by seeing it demonstrated visually (using pictures, video clips, etc.), aurally (through songs, audio clips, 
short reading passages) and orally (through classroom discussions as students connect skills to their everyday 
experiences).  Once this is done, students should be ready to tackle the skill in a reading exercise.  A way of testing if 
students have mastered the skill is to have them incorporate it into a writing exercise.  This will allow them to apply what 
they have learned.  Students who can apply reading skills would be operating at the higher levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy.  
Following this method of teaching comprehension skills will ensure that listening comprehension is always incorporated into 
the teaching of the reading skill.  This would avoid teachers having to provide listening drills in preparation for the sitting of 
the GLAT exams. 
 
15. Grammar, Spelling, and Handwriting are tools to be used to improve students’ writing and are not to be taught as ends in 
themselves.  Practice exercises should be provided to reinforce skills taught in Grammar, Spelling and Handwriting; 
however, the application of these skills should be emphasized in students’ composition writing and in the case of Grammar, 
where applicable, in their speech as well.  When scoring students’ writing, exercises should only be scored for what has 
been taught.  Teachers should develop a running checklist.  Each week, the number of items on the checklist should 
increase as new skills that have been taught are added.  The taught items on the checklist should be continually reinforced.  
By the end of the school year, a sizeable checklist should have been generated.  Students should be aware of what is 
contained in the checklist and should be encouraged to use it to assess their writing before it is even submitted for marking.  
Students’ writing should be marked for content, mechanics, and handwriting/presentation. Handwriting: Grade One 
students should begin writing utilising three lines until their fine motor skills are more developed and their letter formations 
are correct. During the third term of grade two, cursive handwriting can be introduced if students are ready. It is expected 
that cursive handwriting will be formally taught in grade three. 
 
16. Weekly Spelling lists should include words that demonstrate the focus skill, words from other subject areas, and 
words from the grade-level word list included in the appendices of this document.

A good listener is someone who 
engages in active listening. Good 
listeners strive to understand the total 
meaning of a communicated 
message.   
  
During informal settings, a good 
listener:    
 maintains eye contact;  
 shows empathy;  
 respects the opinions of others;  
 repeats key information, when 
appropriate, to convey 
understanding;  
 uses non-verbal communication 
(nod of head etc.) to show that 
he/she is listening; and  
 asks questions at the appropriate 
times.  
Basic:  Have students watch a 
clip from the Parliamentary 
Channel of the House in Session.  
Ask them to identify those 
members who are exhibiting good 
listening habits.  Have them 
explain the characteristic(s) that 
are being displayed.  (Any 
appropriate clip that shows an 
audience listening to a speaker 
may be used.) 
 
Intermediate:  Have students role 
play situations where listening is 
critical (doctor/patient, 
friend/friend, principal/student 
etc.) Have them demonstrate 
good listening skills. 
 
 
As a whole-group, 
challenge students to 
create a Listening 
Rubric. Then, have 
students assess 
themselves on how 
well they listened.

Standard English is a term applied to 
language that is grammatically correct. It 
encompasses grammar, vocabulary, 
pronunciation, and spelling. There are 
times when using dialect or slang can get in 
the way of good communication.  
 
Use Standard English when in class or with 
a more formal audience. Other occasions 
could be when conducting a class 
assembly, participating in a Christmas play 
etc. 
 
The Bahamian Dialect can be used when 
speaking in more informal settings like with 
family or friends.  It has its own special 
vocabulary and pronunciation. It includes 
words like: 
 
 
 bin = been 
 een = am not 
 tanks = thanks  
 dun = done 
 
 
In addition to being used in informal 
conversations, the Bahamian dialect is 
often featured in Bahamian songs, 
commercials, plays, and novels. 
 
Basic:  Have students create a 
rap about the proper use of 
dialect.  Have them give examples 
in the lyrics. 
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
listen to parts of a Bahamian play 
in dialect.  Have students translate 
parts of it into Standard English 
for a non-Bahamian audience.

Intonation refers to the rising and 
falling of the voice.  The voice may 
rise or fall if a question is being 
asked or a demand is being made.  
The intonation may vary depending 
on the purpose of the statement.  A 
person speaking in a monotone 
does not have the rhythmic rise and

tone being used. 
 
Pause – Sometimes speakers 
pause to conclude a point, for 
emphasis, to get the audience’s 
attention and to allow the audience 
a time to think about what has 
transpired. 
 
Think about when the winner of a 
competitive event is about to be 
announced.  Quite often the 
speaker pauses, leaving the 
audience in suspense before 
continuing to announce the winner. 
 
Example: “And the winner of the 
2022-2023 Miss Bahamas 
Competition is..." 
 
Pronunciation – This refers to the 
correctness of sound in a word.  
When speaking formally, ensure 
that sounds like the following are 
said correctly: 
 
 Words beginning with th. 
 Endings of words like ing, ed 
and s.

Use tongue, teeth, and lips to

Facial expressions and gestures 
are a form of non-verbal 
communication that help to convey 
the emotions of the speaker.  
 
Example:  If happy news is being 
delivered, the speaker might wear a 
smile. 
 
If something important is being 
shared, the speaker might have a 
serious expression. 
 
Facial expressions and gestures 
can help to keep the listeners 
engaged.  They should not be 
overused as they can also distract.

Resources 
A syllable is a unit of 
pronunciation. It is a word or part 
of a word with a single vowel 
sound. The number of syllables in a 
word is determined by the number 
of vowel sounds. Words can be 
divided into syllables.  
  
Syllabication helps in:   
a. Decoding words  
b. Reading fluently   
c. Spelling words accurately   
d. Dividing words at the end of 
    a line when writing   
 
Example: in the word murmur, it 
would be mur-mur and not mu-
rmur or murmu-r.  
 
 
Basic:  After presenting each 
syllabication rule, have students 
take turns dividing the words into 
syllables.   
 
Technology Adaptation:  
Use a gamification platform such 
as Quizizz, Blooket, and Quizlet to 
formatively assess students 
through an engaging activity.  
  
Intermediate:  Play the 
“Concentration Category” game. 
Set the categories to two syllable 
words, words with prefixes, 
suffixes, or ‘r’-controlled syllables.  
Students must produce a word 
that falls in a particular category 
and then divide it into syllables. 
As an alternative activity, have 
Provide students with a 
list of unfamiliar words.  
Have them use their 
knowledge of 
syllabication to divide 
and decode them.

Objective 2.18 Decode initial, medial, and final blends and the sounds associated with them. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A consonant blend, also referred to  
as a ‘consonant cluster’, is when two  
or more consonants come together in 
a word. Each consonant keeps its sound 
when blended. 
 
There are four main basic forms of initial, 
medial, and or final consonant blends 
which are: ‘r’-blends, ‘s’-blends,            
‘l’-blends, and ‘n’-blends. These blends 
may appear at the beginning, middle or 
end of words. 
 
Sample Words:   
assignment 
recommend 
drowsy 
slipped 
dramatic 
swindle 
ministerial 
swivel 
presidential 
treasure 
 
Some blends contain three consonants.  
Common three consonant blends include:  
 
str, spl, shr, thr, scr and spr.  
str words:  strangle, strength, strawberry  
spl words:  splurge, splinter, spleen  
shr words:  shrivel, shrugged, shredded  
thr words:   throne, thrush, thrilling  
spr words:  spruce, sprite, sprawl  
Basic: Word Building Build 
unfamiliar words with letter tiles. 
Have the students identify the 
consonant blend in each word 
and state whether the word 
has an initial, middle, or final 
blend. Have students go back to 
the beginning of the word and 
allow students to decode the 
word.   
  
Intermediate:  Word Search 
and Say:  Create a word search 
containing consonant blend 
words that have not been 
introduced to the students. Have 
students find and highlight as 
many words as they can. Then, 
allow the students to decode 
each word out loud.   
 
Advanced:  Display a bag with 
objects containing various 
blends. Without looking, have 
students pull an object out of the 
bag.  Have them say what the 
object is and identify the blend in 
the word. Have the students

When the consonant ‘r’ comes after a 
vowel it sometimes changes the vowel 
sound.  The letter ‘r’ makes the vowel 
have a sound that is different from the 
usual short or long sound.  This 
special sound is considered ‘r-
controlled’.   
 
Sometimes the letters ‘ear’ can make 
the /ɪə/ sound as in ‘years’, 
‘earrings’, and ‘appeared’.   
 
Sometimes the letters ‘ear’ can make 
the /ur/ sound as in ‘earth’, ‘earnest’, 
and ‘earning’.    
   
The /eə/ sound can be spelled ‘air’ as 
in ‘stairway’ and ‘are’ as in ‘barely’.

When ‘le’ is used, a consonant 
normally forms a part of this end 
syllable.  The ‘le’ ending is seen 
mainly after the following 
letters:  b, c, d, f, g, k, p, st, t and z. 
  
Sample Words  
ble – reasonable, acceptable,  
         impossible   
cle – semicircle, motorcycle,

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A trigraph is a group of three letters 
that together form a single specific 
sound.  
 
The letter combination ‘dge’ is 
a trigraph because the three letters 
always function together to form the 
same sound as the letter ‘j’. 
  
When the /j/ sound is heard at the end 
of a syllable and it is immediately 
preceded by a short vowel, it is spelt -
dge.  
 
Example:   budget, fidget  
 
‘dge’ will never come at the beginning 
of a word. It can be in the middle or 
end of a word. 
  
If the /j/ sound is immediately 
preceded by a long vowel, r-
controlled vowel or consonants, 
the /j/ sound is spelt ‘ge’.  
 
Example:  page, gorgeous 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
and sing the rap about the ‘dge’ 
and ‘ge sounds.  Create a set of 
unfamiliar words that contain ‘dge’ 
and ‘ge’. Have students listen to 
the vowel sound to determine 
whether it will be spelt ‘dge’ or 
‘ge’.  
  
Intermediate: Create a list of 
unfamiliar words containing the 
‘dge’ spelling and provide each 
student with the list.  
Have students do the following: 
 Circle every misspelt word in 
the list.   
 Write the misspelt word 
correctly on the blank line 
provided.  
 Write a funny sentence for 
every odd word in the list.

Resources 
Diphthongs are types of vowels where 
two vowel sounds are connected in a 
continuous, gliding motion (to make one  
sound). They are often referred to as 
gliding vowels.  
 
Examples of diphthongs are:  
 /oi/, /oy/, /ow/, /ou/  
 
The diphthongs /ou/ and /ow/ can  
have two distinct sounds.   
 /ou/ can sound like ou as in house, 
and like ou as in sprout.  
 ow as in powerful, and ow 
 as in bellow.  
 
Sample Words:   
counterfoils          exploitation   
mountainous       announcement  
flounder               plough  
hallow                  sparrow  
crowning              prowling  
buoyancy            annoyance   
  
If two vowels are beside each other in a 
word or syllable, the first vowel is 
usually long while the second vowel 
remains silent. This is called 
a vowel digraph.  
 
Basic:  Provide students 
with a sheet that has 
columns for each diphthong. 
Give them a list of words that 
have diphthongs.  Have 
students categorise a list of 
words according 
to the diphthong in each 
word.  Have students add 
two additional words of their 
own to each column.  
  
Intermediate:  Have 
students complete a 
crossword puzzle using 
words with diphthongs and 
vowel digraphs.   
  
Advanced: Have students 
write a poem about a 
content- related subject that 
contains diphthongs and 
digraphs.

words in context that 
have the diphthongs and 
vowel digraphs.  Have 
students complete a 
word study worksheet 
that incorporates 
diphthongs and vowel 
diagraphs.

Examples of vowel digraphs are:   
‘ai’, ‘ee’, ‘ea’, ‘ei’, ‘ie’, ‘oa’, ‘ay’, ‘ue’.  
 
The vowel pairs ‘ie’ and ‘ei’ can also 
be vowel digraphs.   
 
Vowel pair ‘ei’ can spell the long e 
sound, as in ‘conceit’.   
  
In most words, the vowel ‘i’ comes 
 before ‘e’, except after the consonant 
 ‘c’ as in ‘receive’.  
   
Vowel digraph ‘ei’ can spell the  
long a sound, as in ‘veil’.

Alphabetical order refers to the 
organizing of a list of words in the 
order of the alphabet, based on the 
letters in their names. This makes 
information easier to find in a 
dictionary, thesaurus, phone book, 
index, filing system etc.  
  
There are specific rules as to how 
words are organized in alphabetical 
order.  
  
Arrange words in order using their 
first letters.  If the first letters are the 
same, then use the second letters to 
determine the order in which the words 
should appear.  If those are the same, 
then move to third, fourth, fifth letters 
etc.

Contractions can be made by 
shortening a word or a pair of words 
by omitting certain letters or sounds.  
An apostrophe is used to indicate 
missing letters or words.   
  
Contractions can be used when 
writing informally.  Words should be 
written fully when writing formally.

Words often contain base words.  A base 
word is the part of a word that can stand 
alone and has meaning.  It is the 
simplest form of the word. 
 
Example: ‘Legal’ is a base word that 
means ‘permitted by law’.  
   
Prefixes and Suffixes can be added to 
base words to change the meanings of 
these words.  
  
Prefix – A prefix is a word or syllable that 
is added at the beginning of a base 
word.    
  
Prefixes have their own special 
meanings too. Example:  The 
prefix ‘il’ means ‘not’.  
  
The word ‘illegal’ means ‘not permitted 
by law’. 
  
A hyphen may sometimes be placed 
between the prefix and base word.  This 
is done in several instances.  
 
 
 
Basic:  Provide students with a 
list of words.  Have them use the 
rules related to hyphens to identify 
the words to which hyphens 
should be added.

suffixes into groups.  Have 
students search for other related 
words.  For example, -
ist refers to a focused area of 
study.  Have students find words 
that relate: chemist, biologist, 
psychiatrist, botanist etc.  Have 
them share their words with the 
class.

the meanings of prefixes, base 
words, and suffixes to determine 
the meanings of unfamiliar words.

that was added.

Objective 2.30 Add inflectional endings (with or without) spelling changes. 
 
Content

Resources 
An inflectional ending is a word part 
that is added to a base word.  This 
ending can make a word plural, 
change word tense, or help to make 
comparisons.   Some inflectional 
endings are: ‘s’, ‘es’, ‘ing’, ‘ed’, ‘er’ 
and ‘est’. 
 
1. Adding ‘er’ and ‘est’  
  
If the word ends in a ‘consonant’ and 
‘y’, change the ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’.  
Example:  pretty - prettiest 
  
If the word ends in ‘consonant’ and 
‘e’, remove the ‘e’ and add ‘er’ or 
‘est’.  
Example:  fine - finest 
  
If the word ends in a ‘consonant, 
vowel, consonant’, double the last 
letter and add ‘er’ or ‘est’.  
Example:  slim - slimmer 
  
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students make a list of 
as many words with the ‘ing’ ending 
that they could think of in two 
minutes.  The student with the most 
correctly spelt words may win a 
prize.  Do the same with the other 
endings. Students can then categorize 
words according to their inflectional 
ending.  
  
Intermediate: Set up a television 
game show. Have students name that 
ending. Each contestant chooses an 
item from a category. Each item is 
worth a sum of money. When the 
sentence or phrase is read that the 
student chooses, they must indicate 
which word in the sentence has an 
inflectional ending.  Additionally, they 
must spell the entire word.   The 
contestant with the most money is the 
winner.  
 
Advanced:  Have students research 
an era in Bahamian History and write 
a brief account. They should use as 
many words that end with inflectional 
endings as possible.  
 
Have the students 
complete sentences 
by adding inflectional 
endings to base 
words.

2. Adding ‘ed’ and ‘ing’ rules:  
  
If the base word ends in ‘consonant, 
vowel, consonant’ and a stressed 
syllable, double the final consonant 
and add ‘ing’ or ‘ed’.  
Example:  slip – slipping, slipped 
 
If the base verb ends in a ‘consonant’ 
and ‘e’, remove the ‘e’ and add ‘ing’ or 
‘ed’.  
Example:  bottle – bottling/bottled 
  
If the base verb ends in ‘ie’, change 
the ‘ie’ to ‘y’ and add ‘ing’.  
Example:  lie – lying 
 
You make no changes to the ‘ie’ and 
add the letter ‘d’ to make it past tense 
(ed).  
Example:  lie - lied

3. Adding ‘s’ and ‘es’ rules:   
  
If the word ends in ‘ch’, ‘s’, ‘ss’, ‘sh’, 
‘x’ or ‘z’, just add the inflectional 
ending ‘es’ to the word.  
Example:  lunch - lunches 
 
There are some words that end in ‘o’.  
Add ‘es’ to make them plural. 
Example:  mango - mangoes  
mangos (also accepted). 
 
However, words that usually end in 
‘o’, just add ‘s’.  
Example:  memo - memos 
  
If the word ends in ‘f’ or ‘fe’, remove 
the ‘f’ or ‘fe’ and add ‘ves’.  
Example:  knife - knives

Objective 2.32 Distinguish between the British and American spellings of commonly used words. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The two main spellings we use in The 
Bahamas are British English and 
American English. It is important to 
distinguish between the two because 
of the spelling and pronunciation 
differences.  
  
British English keeps the spelling of 
words it has used from other 
languages, mainly French and 
German.  
  
American English spellings are 
based mostly on how the word 
sounds when it is spoken.  
  
Some spelling differences can be 
found at the end of words or the 
spelling changes completely.   
  
When writing, do not switch between 
the British and American spelling. Be 
consistent with the spelling you 
choose.  
  
The table on the next page shows the 
different types of endings that are 
common to both languages. 
Basic: Provide students with a list 
of words that are of American and 
British origin.  Using the cooperative 
groups in your class, have students 
place the words in the correct 
category (British or American) by 
looking at their endings. 
   
Intermediate:  Have students 
identify grocery items that may be 
British or American based on their 
spelling and other information. 
 
Alternate Activity: Dictionary 
Detective Place students in groups, 
give each group a list or words and 
instruct them to indicate the part of 
speech of the word, its origin, 
definition and then write a sentence 
using the word. 
 
Advanced: Have students watch 
clips from an American news show 
and a British news show.  Have 
them observe differences.  Have 
them make note of any words that 
were different, that were used to 
name the same things. Also have 
them indicate spelling differences. 
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet.

Not all the words spoken in English 
are English words.  Their roots were 
formed in another language. Being 
able to recognize certain roots can 
assist with spelling and 
understanding what particular words 
mean.  Recognizing roots can also 
help to see connections between 
words.  
  
Latin  
Latin has a major influence on words 
used in English.  It can often be 
found in words related to science, 
religion, and education.  Knowing 
the meaning of the root words can 
assist with understanding the 
meaning of the whole word.  
  
 In some Latin words, the /k/ is 
represented by a ‘c’.   
Example: canine and collaborate  
 
 The /ü/ sound as in ‘cool’ is 
spelled with a ‘u’ when followed 
by a ‘d’, ‘j’, ‘l’, ‘r’ or ‘s’.             
Example:  frugal and persecute  
 
Basic: Give students a root word 
from a Science or Social Studies 
lesson. Give them the meaning of 
the root and the language from 
which it comes. Have them work in 
groups to create webs of related 
words on charts. Encourage them to 
use dictionaries and textbooks as 
resources. Charts may be 
displayed in the classroom.   
  
Intermediate: Have students plan a 
meal using an Italian dish.  Have 
students compile a shopping list 
of all the ingredients they will 
need.  Give students an 
informal spelling test on these 
words.  
  
 
Advanced:  Have students review 
the spelling rules related to a specific 
language.  Present them with 
unfamiliar words that follow that 
same pattern.  Have them use the 
rules to spell the words.  
 
 
 
Create a Learning 
Game In groups of 
three, challenge 
students to create a 
simple game that 
helps fifth-grade 
students practice 
matching common 
Latin, Greek, and 
Italian roots to their 
meanings. The game 
must include the 3 
types of languages, 
sample words, clear 
rules, game pieces, 
and the answer key. 
Allow students to test 
their game on 
classmates and 
make changes based 
on feedback. 
Students can then 
ask fifth-grade 
students to play.

attention should particularly be given 
to these cues.  
  
Comma – Give a slight pause.  It is 
important to pause at the correct 
time, otherwise the meaning of the 
sentence might change.   
  
For example:   
“Dan likes cooking, his baby brother 
and swimming.”  
  
“Dan likes cooking his baby brother

Quotation Marks – Voice may need 
to be changed to indicate that a 
person is speaking, to reflect what is 
happening in the passage and to 
reflect who is speaking. For example, 
the person may be an annoying 
character with a squeaky voice or

It is important when reading, to pay 
attention to the rate of speed at which 
you are reading, the rise and fall of your 
voice and expression.  
  
Rate – Refers to how fast or how slowly 
one speaks.  Be careful not to speak so 
slowly that listeners lose interest. Do 
not read too quickly, otherwise the 
words may not be clear and the 
listeners may find it difficult to follow.  
  
Breathing can indicate the rate or pace. 
If someone is running or crying, use 
quick short breaths between the words.  
If someone is relaxed, this can be 
portrayed by breathing out slowly.  
  
Intonation – The rise and fall of the 
voice to reflect what is happening in the 
reading piece.  
 
Intonation can communicate up to 70% 
of the meaning of a sentence. Read 
the same sentence below, but each 
time, only place emphasis on the bold 
word to show the influence of 
intonation. 
Basic:  Have students practice 
saying the same phrase 
repeatedly but using their voices 
to portray a variety of emotions. 
They should be able to switch on 
command.   Have them apply this 
to the reading of texts.

Text structure refers to how an author 
organizes information in a text. Being 
aware of non-fiction text structures and 
their purpose helps readers to make 
connections, recognize patterns, 
understand what is important and 
summarize information.  There are five 
basic structures that authors use. 
 
 Description - Provides information 
on a particular topic that is vivid and 
clear.  The thing being described 
can be a living thing like a person, 
animal, or plant.  It can also be an 
event, a process, or a place.   
 
Example:  a travel brochure, 
menus.   
Key words/phrases - for example, 
the characteristics of    
 
 Sequence    Provides the order in 
which something happened or 
should happen.  
 
Example:  recipes, calendars  
Key Words: first, next, finally 
Basic: Have students ‘buddy-
read’ selected paragraphs and 
explain which text structure is 
being used. Students can identify 
key words found in the 
paragraphs. 
 
Intermediate: Given authentic 
reading materials such as menus, 
obituaries, brochures, flyers, diary 
entries, advertisements, have 
students indicate the text structure 
being used. Ask students to 
defend or justify their choice of 
text structure. 
 
Advanced:  Provide students with 
a specific topic related to a 
content area subject such as 
“Plants”.  Have them research 
articles that can fit all five of the 
various text structures.  Have 
them share the materials they 
found and explain why it fits a 
particular text structure. 
 
Have students find 
non-fiction texts that 
fit the five different 
text structures.  Have 
them explain how 
each text fits that 
structure.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A well-written story has five core 
elements. Being able to identify these 
elements and know how they work 
together in a story helps a reader to 
better understand, appreciate and 
evaluate an author’s work. 
 
The five core elements of a narrative 
are:   
  
Characters: the people or personified 
animals and objects in the story  
To learn more about the nature of a 
character, a good reader pays attention 
to his/her words, thoughts, actions, 
and appearance. An individual’s nature 
is his/her usual attitude or behaviour. In 
most stories, the nature of a character 
remains the same throughout the story or 
changes after a dramatic event.  
To figure out the nature of a character, 
ask yourself: 
 What thoughts is the character 
having? 
 What is the character saying? 
 How is the character behaving? 
Basic: Use direct instruction, any 
familiar story, and the Think Aloud 
Strategy to model how to complete

Point of View: refers to ‘who’ is telling 
the story. This speaker is known as the 
narrator. Narrators can be a character 
in the story or a witness who is speaking

or fictional and about a time that is in 
the past, present, or future. 
Sometimes, to help figure out the setting, 
a good reader must look for details such

change the actions of the characters, 
events of the story, and the audience’s 
mood.   
 
To determine if the setting is important, a

Plot: the order of the most important 
events in a story. The four (4) main 
parts of a plot: the background 
(introducing the setting and characters), 
a conflict, the climax, and a resolution.  
The conflict of a story is something that 
goes wrong for the main character. The 
main character can face a conflict with 
[1] himself, [2] another character, [3] 
culture, or [4] nature. In most cases, the 
character then takes action to solve this 
problem. Good readers know that there 
may be more than one major conflict in a 
story. 
The climax is the most exciting part of 
the story. In most stories, this happens 
right before the problem is solved. Being 
able to follow a clear plot helps a reader 
to better understand, enjoy and evaluate 
an author’s work. 
 
The resolution is how the 
conflict/problem is solved and happens 
near the end of the story. 
 
Theme: the message or lesson that the 
author wants the reader to learn from a 
story 
point of view of the character. 
 Create the picture on the 
postcard to show the most 
important setting in the story.

Resources 
Context Clues are the words that 
surround an unfamiliar word.  These 
words give clues about the meaning 
of the new word.  Some context 
clues are: 
 
Synonyms – Words that mean the 
same or almost the same as an 
unfamiliar word.  
 
Example:  The water tower stands 
126 feet tall and offers a breath 
taking or amazing view of Nassau. 
  
Antonyms – Sometimes a context 
clue would contrast with a new word.  
 
Example:  The guineps from Ms. 
Thurston’s tree were succulent, but 
the ones from Mr. Mason’s tree were 
hard and dry.   
 
Definition – This is the kind of 
context clue where the writer gives 
the meaning of or explains a word in 
a sentence.  
 
Basic: Introduce the different 
types of context clues, one at a 
time.  Have the students 
complete questions related to 
each type before presenting 
more than one type.    
 
Intermediate: Present students 
with sentences that contain 
different types of context clues.  
Have them use the clues to 
explain the meanings of 
unfamiliar words. 
  
Advanced: Have students read 
a paragraph where they have to 
use the different types of context 
clues to explain the meaning of 
underlined words. 
 
Provide students with a 
passage that utilizes 
context clues.  Have

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Classification refers to the 
grouping of items based on 
characteristics that they have in 
common.  
 
The name of each group is called 
a category. Categories have a 
heading or a label that tells what 
their classified items have in 
common. 
 
Authors often organize their 
ideas, descriptions, and details 
into categories during the 
researching and planning stages 
of writing.  Outlines are developed 
to assist in classifying the 
information in an organized 
manner. 
 
Understanding the existing 
relationships among categories 
can help the reader navigate the 
text quickly and successfully.  
 
It also helps a reader to detect 
and ignore details unrelated to the 
main idea of the material. 
Basic:  Using the Classified Ads, have 
students identify which area they would 
have to look to find certain information.  
Example: Where would you look to 
find a truck to buy? 
 
Intermediate:  Using the Television 
Guide, present various scenarios to 
students where several criteria must be 
met.  Have them select the best 
channels that meet those 
requirements.  Have them justify their 
responses.  
 
Example: Mr. Smith is a retired Math 
teacher.  He spends lots of time in 
nature working in his garden. Which 
channel(s) would you recommend for 
him to watch?  Give reasons to support 
your recommendation.   
 
Advanced:  Using the Classified Ads, 
present scenarios to students where 
they must use certain criteria to select 
the ad that most suitably meets that 
need.

Resources 
Making predictions involves using 
the information that has been provided 
by the author along with what you 
know already from past experiences 
or personal knowledge, to figure out 
what will happen next. Predictions 
must be relevant to the situation and 
logical.  
  
A reader can make inferences and 
draw conclusions to make better 
predictions during reading, when more 
information is provided.  
 
To make a good prediction before and 
during reading a fictional text, ask 
yourself:   
 What is the title telling me about 
the characters? The setting? The 
events?  
 What are the clues in the story 
telling me about the main 
problem? 
 What do I think the main character 
will do next to solve this problem?  
 What would I have done next in 
this situation? 
 
Basic:  Have students read 
various short scenarios and 
choose the most logical 
prediction from a given list as to 
what might happen next. Have 
students share why they chose 
the option they did.  
  
Intermediate:   Have students 
read or watch a weather report 
and then make predictions about 
what a meteorologist’s advice 
would be for boaters and the 
public. 
  
Advanced:  As students read a 
passage or watch a short Pixar 
film, have them stop at certain 
points.  Provide students with 
various possible predictions. Have 
students read each prediction and 
determine whether it is logically 
based on evidence from the text.  
Students will continue reading to 
see if the prediction they chose 
was correct.

Objective 2.42 Derive from text, the main idea and supporting details. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The main idea of a text is the most 
important idea that the writer wants 
readers to know about the topic. It is 
what is mostly being talked about 
in the text. Knowing the main idea 
helps a reader to better understand 
and organize the lesser details of 
the text when summarizing, 
paraphrasing, and retelling.   
 
Sometimes, a writer directly states 
the main idea in the text. It can be 
stated at the beginning of a 
paragraph as the topic sentence or 
the end as the concluding 
sentence. However, the main idea 
can also appear anywhere in the 
text.   
 
Sometimes, the main idea is 
unstated and the reader must figure 
it out from the supporting details. 
The supporting details are the 
sentences that tell us more 
information about the main idea.  
 
 
 
 
Basic: A to Z Ideas   As a whole 
group, have students produce a list 
of random topics beginning with 
each letter of the alphabet. In groups 
of three, challenge students to pick 
and classify 10 of the 26 topics, 
based on their similarities. Have 
students then create a main idea 
label for each category formed. 
Allow each group to share the labels 
of their categories. Encourage peers 
to ask questions for clarification or 
give suggestions for corrections. 
Lead from the activity to discuss 
main ideas and supporting details.  
 
Intermediate: Provide students with 
different colour highlighters and a 
short passage with a stated main 
idea. After reading, allow learners to 
highlight the main idea sentence and 
discuss its location in the passage. 
Have students then highlight the 
supporting details with a different 
colour. Gradually introduce 
passages with unstated main ideas 
and model how details are used to 
draw a conclusion about the most 
important idea.

Good readers also understand that 
the main idea and the theme of the 
text are different. The main idea 
helps you to figure out the lesson or 
theme of a text. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Advanced: All Mixed Up! Provide 
students with a skeleton of a short 
essay by removing all the supporting 
sentences and leaving the main idea 
for each paragraph intact. In pairs, 
give students the strips of sentences 
with the details, but also include 
extra sentences that are off-topic. 
Challenge learners to reconstruct 
the essay and exchange their 
finished work with other groups for 
peer evaluation. Encourage peers to 
ask questions for clarification or give 
suggestions for corrections. Allow 
students to use the reflective 
questions and compare their 
approaches to solving this puzzle:  
 
1. What did I know before I began 
the activity?  
2. How did that help me to solve 
this problem?

Sequence is the order in which things 
happen. Sequence also refers 
to steps in a process such as a 
recipe or directions.  
  
Authors may use key words or 
phrases to help readers understand 
sequence.  
 
Key/Signal Words: while, previously, 
eventually, over time, suddenly, in 
conclusion, meanwhile and finally.  
   
Dates tell you a specific month or 
year.  
 
Key words such as ‘meanwhile’ and 
‘simultaneously’ are clues that two or 
more events are happening at the 
same time.   
  
If there are no clue words, you can 
visualize the story in your mind and 
ask yourself what happened first, next, 
then and last.  
 
In written pieces/texts, bullets, 
numbers, and numerals can be used 
to indicate sequence.  
Basic: Provide small groups with 
directions to locate an item hidden 
around the school.  Have students 
highlight all sequence key words.  Next, 
have students read and follow the 
directions. After students have located 
the item have them answer questions 
about the process/steps they followed.  
  
Intermediate: Have students listen to a 
portion of a news story, using the 
radio. Provide students with a written 
copy so they can follow along. After 
students have listened to the recording 
twice, have them highlight all the key 
words that indicate sequence. Have 
them use some of these key words to 
help answer questions related to 
sequence.  
  
Advanced: Have students read 
directions that have been mixed up, on 
how to make a paper boat or kite. There 
should be no sequence keywords. Have 
students read each step and visualize 
what is being made. After students have 
rearranged the steps in sequential order, 
they should insert key sequence words. 
Have students read 
a short passage 
and recall the 
events using key 
words.

Resources 
Most stories are divided into two 
major genres: fiction and non-
fiction. The Latin word genre means 
‘group’ or ‘kind’. 
 
Knowing the genre of a text can help 
the readers to make reasonable 
predictions and adjust their reading 
speed to match the genre. Readers 
can skim read non-fiction material to 
find information or read it slowly- 
word for word.   
 
Fiction is a story that is created from 
the author’s imagination. It refers to 
things that are invented or that are 
not true. Examples of fictional stories 
include: fairy tales, legends, 
science fiction, historical fiction, 
folklore and realistic fiction. 
 
Realistic Fiction - Stories that can 
happen in real life but didn’t happen.  
 
Fairy Tale - stories about magical 
creatures with happy endings usually 
written for children.  
 
 
Basic:  Book Summaries  
Have the class visit the school or 
community library and read the 
summary at the back of various 
books. Encourage students to also 
examine the book covers. Have 
students then record the titles of 
five non-fiction books and five 
fiction books. During this time, 
circulate throughout students and 
challenge them to identify the sub-
genre of their selected books. 
Provide corrective feedback, as 
required. 
 
Intermediate: “If Books Could 
Talk!”  
Assign each student a type of 
literature. Allow students to prepare 
a speech given by the literature as 
if it was human. Challenge learners 
to creatively include its main 
characteristics, how it is often 
perceived by most readers, and any 
challenges it may experience in the 
literary world. The literature can be 
humanised with thoughts and 
emotions. Encourage students to 
use relevant props or visuals. 
Pre-Assessment 
(before teaching): Have 
students complete a 
worksheet designed to 
identify genres and sub-
genres, based on 
descriptions. Let 
students document their 
scores in their 
notebooks. 
 
Example: 
“My Vacation in Abaco” 
by Jerome Gardiner 
Jerome describes his trip 
to the island in five thrilling 
paragraphs.  
Genre: _______________

students complete the 
same worksheet. Let 
students compare their 
new score with their pre-
score. Have learners ask

Resources 
In a world filled with free-flowing 
information, “fake news”, and 
persuasive techniques, it is important 
that individuals can tell the difference 
between a fact and an opinion.  
 
A fact is something that has 
happened or something that can be 
proven as true or false. 
Facts can be proven through 
observation, measuring or by 
checking reference books and 
credible internet resources. 
 
Example:  
The House of Assembly and the 
Senate are in Parliament Square. 
 
This fact can be checked by visiting a 
credible government website or 
Parliament Square. 
 
A statement of opinion cannot be 
proved true or false because it tells 
someone’s ideas, feelings, or 
beliefs.  Opinions are normally 
associated with phrases such as ‘I 
think’, ‘I feel’, ‘I believe’ and ‘In my

Engage students with the basic recall 
questions about the text such as: 
‘who’, ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’ and 
‘how’. 
Have each student create two (2) 
large flashcards and give each card 
one label: ‘Fact’ or ‘Opinion’. To play 
the game, read aloud phrases and 
sentences from the letter - some 
opinions and some facts. Challenge 
students on the count of three to

A summary is different from the 
retelling of an event because a 
summary should only include the

retelling of an event or story 
includes as many details as

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Comparing and contrasting requires 
a person to look at people, objects or 
situations and think about how they 
are different or alike.   
 
Authors often compare or contrast for 
three (3) reasons: 
1. To persuade a reader that one 
thing is better than the other.  
2. To help a reader pay closer 
attention to details. 
3. To explain something unfamiliar 
using something that is more 
familiar.  
 
Sometimes authors use clue words to 
signal comparison and contrasts. 
Some words and phrases that signal 
comparisons are: ‘like’, ‘are similar’, 
‘still’, ‘in the same way’ and ‘in 
comparison’.  
   
Some words and phrases that signal 
contrasts are: ‘however’, ‘on the 
other hand’, ‘although’, ‘but’, ‘yet’, 
‘nevertheless’, ‘on the contrary’, 
‘nonetheless’ and ‘in contrast’.       
  
Basic: Allow students to go online to 
read the weather report for another 
country and The Bahamas.  Record it 
on a Venn Diagram.  Compare and 
contrast the weather in both countries 
chosen.  Students can include terms

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The author does not always directly tell the 
reader everything that is happening in the 
story.  However, the writer gives hints or 
clues so that the reader can figure out what 
is not stated directly.  Good readers use 
the information given, along with what 
they already know, to make inferences. 
There are several different types of 
inferences that can be made. 
 
1. Cause and Effect – The author may  
provide clues to what happened (the event) 
or what might have caused the event. 
 
To figure out clues about an event  
or what might have caused the  
event, ask the following questions. 
 What is happening in the environment? 
 Under what circumstances have I seen 
or experienced such a thing?   
 How are the characters reacting? 
 
Example:  When we got home, my mom let 
out a loud gasp in dismay!  It was then 
that we children noticed that the front door 
was wide open, and furniture had been 
thrown all around the room.   
 
Basic: Introduce each inference 
type one at a time.  Have 
students complete several 
activities related to each type of 
inference.   
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
read a paragraph or watch Bre’ 
Bookie and Rabbie short stories 
(Sands, 2020).  Have them 
answer questions that cover 
various inference types. 
  
Advanced: Have students read 
an authentic piece of literature.  
Have them make inferences as 
they read.

2. Feeling and Attitude – Authors 
sometimes give clues as to how a 
character is feeling through the actions or 
movements of the character.  
 
To figure out clues as to how a character is 
feeling, ask the following questions: 
 What is the character doing? 
 What is the character’s body movement 
like? 
 How is the character responding? 
 
Example:  Miriam glared at the customer 
as she gave him a refund. 
 
Is Miriam happy to be giving the customer a 
refund?   No. 
How do you know? She is angry because 
the passage states that she was 
“glaring” at the customer. 
 
3. Action - Authors sometimes give clues 
as to what a character is doing, by 
indicating the environment, identifying 
items that are in the environment and 
describing the character’s movements.

 Where is the character? 
 What are the movements of the 
character like? 
 Who or what is in the environment? 
 
Example: 
Mummy gathered onions, sweet 
peppers, cucumbers, celery, tomatoes, a 
lime, and an orange and placed them on 
the kitchen counter.  She began dicing 
them.  She grabbed the conch soaking in 
salt and lemon juice and placed it on the 
board.    
  
What is mummy getting ready to do? She 
is getting ready to make conch salad.   
 
What information did you use to make this 
inference? She gathered ingredients 
used in making conch salad and she 
was dicing them. 
 
4. Problem-Solution – A character in the 
story might be presented with a 
problem.  The author may not indicate 
directly how it was solved but would 
provide clues as to how it was resolved.

To help figure out the solution, ask the 
following questions: 
 What is the problem? 
 What action is taking or has taken 
place? 
 What does it normally mean when 
something like that is happening? 
 
Example:  Jeremy was extremely hungry.  
He had forgotten to take his lunch to school 
that day.  When he arrived at home, he saw 
an apple pie cooling on the rack.  At 
dinner time his mom wondered why he 
could only take a few bites of food. 
 
How did Jeremy solve his problem? He ate 
the pie that was cooling on the rack. 
 
5. Character – Authors provide clues as to 
the character and personality of the 
characters in their stories. 
 
To learn more about the characters about

Objective 2.49 Identify cause and effect. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A cause is an event or idea that leads to 
a result called an effect.  Signal words 
such as because, since, so, therefore, 
due to and as a result, help us to 
identify cause and effect relationships.    
  
A cause can have more than one effect 
as well as an effect can have more than 
one cause. 
 
To find the cause-and-effect relationship 
during reading, a good reader will ask:  
 
 What happened? (Effect)  
 Why did this happen? (Cause)  
  
Sometimes sentences that include cause 
and effect relationships do not use 
signal words.  In this case, it is up to the 
reader to make the connection.   
  
Example:  
Jermaine smiled and did his happy 
dance as the big slice of guava duff that 
was placed in front of him.    
   
In this sentence the cause is – “The 
big slice of guava duff being placed in 
front of him”.   
Basic:  In pairs, have students 
play a game of Charades where 
they are given scenarios to act out. 
For example, throwing stones and 
a crying person who was hit with a 
stone. The remaining students will 
identify the cause-and-effect 
relationships portrayed.  
   
Intermediate:  Have students 
create cause and effect posters 
using headlines or pictures from 
local newspapers.  Students can 
add cause and effect sentences to 
caption pictures or headlines 
used.  
 
Example:  
Use a headline from a newspaper 
that says something about the 
lockdown and curfews that were in 
place in 2020.  Show a picture of 
an empty road. 
 
Sentence: As a result of the 
lockdown in April 2020, roads and 
highways were devoid of vehicles.

Resources 
A generalization is a broad statement that 
tells how a group of people, animals or 
things are similar. Many times, 
generalizations are not entirely true 
because there are usually exceptions.   
  
Example: Many Bahamians would rather 
reside on a Family Island instead of New 
Providence 
   
Generalizations are either valid or faulty.  
Valid generalizations are based on facts 
or logic, whereas faulty generalizations 
are not supported by facts.  
 
Clue words/phrases that often signal valid 
generalizations are: some, most, many, 
sometimes, often, probably, few, in 
general, and rarely. 
 
Clue words that often signal faulty 
generalizations are: everyone, nobody, 
all, none, always and never.   
 
Faulty generalizations usually do not have 
signal words. 
Example:  Bahamians are industrious and 
hard working. 
Basic: Odd Man Out: Give students 
sentence strips with statements on 
them. Some sentences should be 
generalizations while some should 
not. Have students, in groups of four, 
stand in front of the classroom with their 
sentence strips. One student must not be 
holding a generalization while the others 
are. The seated students will vote on 
which student is not holding a 
generalization. Lead a discussion on how 
they were able to identify the ‘odd 
man’, as well as the key words used.  
  
Intermediate: Invite students to take 
turns reading passages aloud. Have 
classmates listen for generalizations. Ask 
students to explain how they determined 
if a statement was a generalization. 
Discuss whether each generalization is 
valid or faulty. For valid generalizations, 
students must provide the details that 
proved the statement was valid.

detailed Generalization Graphic 
Organizer where they must use details to 
make appropriate (valid) generalizations.

Objective 2.51 Interpret the author’s purpose. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Every author has a reason for writing.  
This is known as the author’s purpose. 
There are four common reasons for 
writing:  
 
To Inform - When writing to inform or 
explain, the author uses facts. This is 
known as expository writing. 
Examples: cookbooks, science, history, 
textbooks, and biographies  
 
To Entertain - Many stories, plays, and 
poems are written to teach a lesson or 
simply amuse their audience. This is also 
known as narrative writing.  
 
To Describe - An author may describe an 
event, scene, or person in detail. Words 
that appeal to the senses of the reader or 
listener are used. This is known 
as descriptive writing.  
 
To Persuade - Sometimes an author tries 
to persuade readers to agree with him or 
her or to take a particular action. This is 
known as persuasive writing.  
Examples: most commercials, campaign 
speeches, and advertisements.  
Basic: Present clips of television 
shows that can fit into each of 
the four common purposes for 
writing.  Have students identify 
the author’s (script writer’s) 
purpose and discuss the reasons 
for his/her decisions.  
   
Intermediate:  Have students 
browse appropriate 
magazines.  Students can 
find examples of propaganda 
techniques.  Have students 
share their selections with the 
class.  Discuss their 
responses.    
   
Advanced:  Divide the class into 
four groups.  Select a common 
topic.  Have each group produce 
a piece of writing that reflects 
one of the four common 
purposes for writing.  
 
Have students read 
short paragraphs to 
determine the author’s 
purpose.

Authors sometimes use propaganda 
techniques to influence the opinions, 
emotions, attitudes, or behaviours of 
readers.  There are several main 
propaganda techniques.   
 
 Bandwagon – Gives the impression 
that everyone is doing a particular 
thing and that is why readers should do 
it as well, so that they are not left out. 
Example:  Nobody wants to be at 
home for the Boxing Day Parade, so 
you had better get your tickets now 
before they are all gone! 
 
 Glittering Generalizations – These 
are statements that make people feel 
good.  They can be based loosely on 
people’s beliefs and morals.  They are 
positive in nature.   
Example:  This air conditioner is 
environmentally friendly! 
 
 Name Calling – This is used to show a 
person or a product in a bad light.  
Example:   One brand of cereal might 
be called “crunchy” and “fresh” while 
another may be called “soggy” and 
“stale”.

 Testimonial – Celebrities, social 
media personalities, public figures and 
movie stars may be used to endorse a 
product or a belief.   
Example: “Baseball player, Don 
Roberts, drinks Vitamalt to keep him 
hitting those home runs.” 
 
 Transfer – This is the transfer of a 
good quality or bad quality onto 
something else, by association. 
Example:  During the Covid-19 
Pandemic there was a campaign for 
people to get vaccinated.  Prominent 
people in the community such as the 
Prime Minister, church leaders etc. 
were shown on television getting their 
shots.  It was felt that since people 
have a level of trust in these leaders, 
then they would transfer that trust to 
the vaccine and think it was safe to 
take. 
 
 Card Stacking – Involves focusing on 
the positive qualities of a product and 
leaving out the negative.   
Example:  An ice-cold drink may be 
touted as the best thing to cool you on 
a hot day.  It has a terrific flavour that 
makes your taste buds come alive.

The fact that it is loaded with calories 
or sugar would be ignored. 
 
 Plain folks – This is where a product 
is associated with everyday people. 
Example:  To encourage people to 
attend a particular event, the 
advertisers use a typical family to 
promote it. 
 
Regardless of the author’s purpose, there 
are clue words in his or her writing that tell 
us how the author feels or his/her 
viewpoint about what has been written. 
This is referred to as “author bias”. 
  
To find out how the author feels about a 
piece of writing, ask the following 
questions: 
 
1. Are there “feeling” words included in 
the piece, such as ‘good’, ‘bad’, ‘great’, 
‘fantastic’, ‘terrible’ etc.? 
2. How is the event, person, thing, or idea 
being described?  ‘irresponsible’, 
‘organised’, ‘interesting’, ‘boring’ etc. 
3. Are negative or positive words being 
used in the piece?  ‘distasteful’, ‘tasty’, 
‘satisfying’, ‘dissatisfied’, ‘filling’ etc. 
4. Does the author appear to be arguing 
for one side over another?

decisions that are made based on 
evidence found in the passage, 
what the readers know and the 
reader’s own experiences, beliefs, 
morals, and values. 
   
When reading fiction, readers make 
judgements about the decisions and 
actions of characters in a story. They 
may agree or disagree with a 
character’s actions.  They may also 
decide if a character or an action is 
fair or unfair, wise, or foolish, or 
generous or selfish.

A Figure of Speech is a phrase or 
word that means something different 
altogether from what is being said. 
Knowing how each figure of speech 
works can help a reader see a clearer 
picture of what is being described and 
correctly figure out the author’s 
message.   
   
Personification gives human 
qualities to non-human things.   
   
Example:  The stars danced as the 
sea breeze whistled the Caribbean 
beat.   
  
When trying to find and interpret 
personification, a reader can ask:  
   
1. Which object is performing the 
action?  
2. What human action is the thing 
doing that cannot really happen?  
3. What is the author trying to tell me 
about this thing being described?  
 
Hyperbole: This is an exaggeration. It 
is over-emphasizing or stretching the 
Basic: Character Web  
Play a commercial that contains a 
nonhuman object acting like a 
human. Examples: Mucinex, 
Geico, Cheetos, or M&Ms. Use 
the actions of the object to discuss 
personification and hyperboles.   
   
Choose any short, fictional text 
with a personified character. 
Fables are best. Guide students to 
complete a web about the 
character’s actions, words, etc. 
Incorporate the guiding questions 
for “Interpreting Personification 
and Hyperboles” to figure out how 
the author wants the readers to 
feel or think.

be dramatic or add humour.  
 
“She was the best worker that has 
ever lived,” her manager sobbed.  
   
When trying to find and interpret a 
hyperbole, a reader can ask:  
   
1. Is this statement literally true?  
2. Which part of the statement is 
being exaggerated?  
3. Is the author trying to emphasize a 
point or just add humour?   
  
Alliteration and Onomatopoeia act 
as the sound effects of the text.  
   
Alliterations are created by repeating 
the beginning sound in two or more 
neighbouring words.  
   
Onomatopoeias are words that are 
actual sounds.  
Example:  The instructor kissed his 
teeth, “tsk, tsk, tsk”, with disgust.  
 
When trying to interpret an alliteration 
or onomatopoeia, a reader can ask:  
1. What person, place, thing, or idea 
is being described?

interpretation of their meanings in 
the conversation as well. Allow

and ask them to choose one 
headline of interest without 
reading its story. Have students 
take the perspective of an 
interviewee and create a comedic 
response to a reporter on the topic 
of the headline chosen. The 
response should include each 
type of figurative language and a

A sentence is a group of words 
that express a complete thought. It 
begins with a capital letter and ends 
with a punctuation mark.  It has two 
parts:  a subject and a predicate. 
 
A fragment is a group of words that 
only make up part of a sentence. A 
fragment does not express a 
complete thought or idea. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students race against 
the clock to identify whether each 
statement read is a Sentence or 
Fragment.  In pairs, one student will 
flash sentence strips in front of the 
other, placing them in the correct pile 
after they have been identified.  The 
pair that is the first to shout, “finish” 
wins. These students must present 
and support their classified strips to 
the class. Peers will provide 
feedback regarding the correctness 
of the groupings.    
 
Intermediate:  Distribute fragment 
cards and tell students that they are 
going shopping for items to complete 
a “sentence meal”.  Display 
conjunctions, punctuation marks as 
well as predicates and subjects that

Objective 3.18 Construct declarative, interrogative, exclamatory and imperative sentences. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
There are four basic types of 
sentences. Each sentence type has 
a different purpose.  
 
Declarative sentences tell 
something or make a statement. 
They end with a period (.) 
 
Interrogative sentences ask a 
question.  They end with a question 
mark (?) 
 
Imperative sentences give 
commands. They end with a period 
(.) 
 
Exclamatory sentences show 
strong feelings or emotions. They 
end with an exclamation mark (!) 
 
 
Knowing the different sentence 
types and how to use them will 
make your writing more interesting 
to read.  
 
 
 
Basic:  Provide students with vibrant, 
engaging photographs. In pairs, have 
students take turns dictating and 
recording exclamatory and imperative 
sentences about the pictures. Allow them 
to share their sentences with the class. 
 
Intermediate:  In small groups, present 
students with a copy of a story that 
includes the four (4) types of sentences. 
Read aloud the story with appropriate 
expression. Challenge students to listen 
and identify the exclamatory, declarative, 
interrogative, and imperative sentences 
in the story.  Project the story for the 
class to confirm or adjust their answers.

Objective 3.19 Identify run-on sentences. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A run-on sentence is two or more 
simple sentences not separated by 
correct punctuation and 
connecting words or 
conjunctions.  A run-on sentence 
does not mean a sentence is too 
long; longer sentences are likely to 
be run-ons only when they contain 
more than one complete idea. 
 
Example of a Run-On Sentence 
and Ways to Correct it: 
 
“Steven Gardiner is the fastest 
runner in the world he wins all the 
races!” 
 
1. Steven Gardiner is the fastest   
runner in the world.  He wins all 
the races! 
 
2. Steven Gardiner is the fastest 
runner in the world, so he wins 
all the races! 
 
3. Steven Gardiner is the fastest 
runner in the world; he wins all 
the races. 
Basic:  Read aloud several examples of 
run-on sentences as well as complete 
sentences.  As each sentence is read, 
instruct students to ‘stand up’ if the 
sentence is correct, but to ‘remain 
seated’ if it is a run-on sentence.  Allow 
students to defend their choices. Record 
all run-on sentences and in a large 
group, demonstrate how to correct run-
on sentences. 
 
Intermediate:  In groups, give students 
several sentence strips containing run-on 
sentences.  Have them use scissors to 
cut the strips at the correct place to make 
each into two sentences.  Allow them to 
write the two new sentences with the 
correct punctuation and capitalization.   
 
Advanced: Have students work in 
groups for this “Runaway Paragraph” 
activity.  Give each group a lengthy 
paragraph that is made up of one 
sentence (a capital letter at the beginning 
and one end mark). Have them take 
turns to collaboratively correct this 
paragraph. Allow the learners to share 
their edited paragraph with others. 
 
Have students 
complete a worksheet 
where they have to 
identify and correct run-
on sentences.

Objective 3.20 Identify different types of nouns. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested

Resources 
Nouns are words that name a person, 
place, animal, thing, or idea. They are 
known as common nouns, if they do 
not name a particular person, place, 
animal, thing, or idea.  
 
Common nouns are usually not 
capitalized unless they begin a 
sentence or are part of a title. 
 
Example:   
Person: policeman 
Place: downtown 
Animal: dog          
Thing: building 
Idea: fear 
 
A proper noun is the name of a 
particular person, place, or thing.  A 
proper noun begins with a capital letter. 
Days of the week, months of the year, 
holidays, historical documents, 
institutions, and organizations are 
examples of proper nouns.   
 
Example:  
Person: Jalen Pinder 
Place:  Princess Margaret Hospital 
Basic:   Make two sets of cards: one 
set with common nouns and the other 
set with their matching nouns. 
Combine both sets of cards and 
randomly give each student one card.  
Have students work together to match 
each common noun with its proper 
noun by looking for their partner card. 
For instance, the student with the 
noun “cereal” will have to find the 
student with the “Lucky Charms” 
proper noun card. 
 
Lead from this activity to introduce the 
difference between these concrete 
nouns and the term ‘abstract nouns. 
 
Intermediate:  My Favourite! 
Have students ask each member of 
staff to name their favourite: 
 
1. thing, person, place, or holiday. 
2. feeling or character quality. 
 
Instruct students to record each 
person’s response and job title under 
their name. Lead from these answers 
to explain the difference between 
concrete and abstract nouns. Allow 
learners to then edit their writing to 
Spot the Error:  
Fill in the answers 
on a worksheet 
designed to identify 
concrete and 
abstract nouns. 
Intentionally include 
errors with the 
identification.  
 
Provide students 
with the incorrect 
worksheet. Ask 
learners to spot and 
correct all the 
errors. Require 
students to provide 
a rationale for each 
correction made.

Proper nouns help to make one’s 
writing more specific. 
 
Example:  
 Take these books to the school.  
 
 Take these Social Studies books to 
Gerald Cash Primary School. 
 
Concrete nouns are nouns that can be 
physically seen and experienced with 
your five (5) senses. They can be 
common or proper nouns.    
 
Examples:  table, The Mall at 
Marathon 
   
Abstract nouns cannot be physically 
seen or touched. They are ideas, 
feelings, thoughts, or character 
qualities.    
 
Examples:  freedom, January, brave, 
patience, friendship, joy, peace, wise  
 
ensure that proper capitalization was 
used for proper nouns.   
 
Advanced: Editing Like a Pro! 
Present students with a typed Bible 
passage that has all the capital letters 
removed. Have students underline, 
then capitalize proper nouns in the 
passage (like the names of people, 
countries, mountains, etc.). Using a 
green highlighter, ask students to 
highlight three abstract nouns used in 
the passage.

A singular noun names one person, 
place, thing, or idea. 
 
A plural noun names more than one 
person, place, thing, or idea. 
 
Most nouns become plural by adding 
an ‘s’ 
 
Examples:  holiday - holidays,  
                  veterinarian - veterinarians 
 
Nouns ending in ch, sh, s, ss or x, add 
‘es’ to show more than one.

success            successes 
 
Nouns ending in a consonant and y 
become plural by changing the ‘y’ to ‘i’ 
and adding ‘es’. 
 
Examples:   
country – countries 
party – parties  
 
Basic:  Accompany the students on 
a nature walk around the school. 
Have students compile a list of ten 
objects written as singular words to 
convert to their plural form.  
 
Intermediate:  Allow students to 
choose a noun card from a box.  
For each one chosen, they must 
write on the reverse side, the plural 
of the given noun by adding an ‘s’ 
or ‘es’.  Students can compete in a 
noun relay game to see which team 
would be the first to complete all 
the cards correctly.   
 
Advanced:   Have students discuss 
marine animals in The Bahamas.  
Have them generate a list of fifteen 
singular and plural nouns. Have 
students compose a descriptive 
paragraph using at least five 
singular and five plural words from 
their lists.

Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
To form the plural of some nouns, you do 
not add ‘s’ or ‘es’.  Rather, the spelling of 
the noun must change.  These are called 
irregular plural nouns.  
Examples: 
bacteria – bacterium  
curriculum – curricula  
chateau – chateaux 
oasis - oases 
 
Add ‘s’ to nouns ending in ‘f’, ‘fe’ or ‘ff’. 
Examples:  
handkerchief – handkerchiefs  
giraffe – giraffes  
mastiff – mastiffs. 
 
For some nouns, drop the ‘f’ or ‘fe’ and 
add ‘ves’.  
Examples: 
scarf- scarves 
wharf – wharves. 
 
Some nouns have the same singular and 
plural forms. 
Examples: 
aircraft – aircraft 
grapefruit– grapefruit 
gallows- gallows  
 
Basic:  Have students work in 
pairs to produce the irregular 
plural for the noun given. 
 
Intermediate: Have  
students brainstorm as many 
irregular plural nouns as they 
can think of.  Using a T-chart, 
have students create a learning 
visual chart.  Make a web of 
these words to mount in the 
classroom. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
proofread a passage with errors 
in forming plural nouns.  Have 
them rewrite the passage with 
the corrected forms of the 
irregular verb. 
Have students 
complete a 
worksheet where 
they must form 
irregular plurals.

Objective 3.23 Identify compound words. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A compound word is made up of two 
or more words. 
sand + box = sandbox 
shoe + laces = shoelaces 
 
Compound words can come in various 
forms: 
 
Open form – This means that there is 
a space between the two words. 
Example:  real estates 
 
Closed form – There is no space 
between the words. 
Example:  godmother 
 
Hyphenated Form - Some 
compounds have a hyphen between 
the words. This helps to show that the 
words being together have their own 
special meaning. 
Example:  up-to-date - current 
 
When using ‘high’ or ‘low’ before a 
noun, use a hyphen. 
 
Example:   
He came into the clinic with a low-
grade fever. 
Basic: The teacher can place 
words in a box that can be used to 
make compound words.  One by 
one, students can pick cards out 
of the box.  Students whose words 
can form a compound word 
should pair up and stand at the 
front of the classroom. Using their 
spelling words, students can make 
bookmarks with the words to keep 
handy as they read and complete 
other tasks. 
  
Intermediate:  Disseminate 
newspaper articles to the 
students. Have them search for 
ten compound words. Have 
students create a glossary with 
their set of compound words. 
  
Advanced:  Have students write a 
short narrative about ‘The 
Spookiest Halloween Ever.’  
They should use at least five (5) 
compound words in their story. 
For instance: tombstone 
Revising Like a 
Professional! Provide 
each student with a 
short passage. Instruct 
students to enhance 
the text by adding 
compound words (two 
open, three closed, 
and two hyphenated 
forms). 
 
Give an extra point for 
each combination of 
verb/noun and 
adjective/noun used. 
 
Be sure to have 
students peer edit and

Collective nouns name groups of 
objects, people, or animals.  Some 
collective nouns are flexible and can 
be used to name different groups of 
things. For example, a collection of 
keys is called a “bunch”. A group of 
bananas on a tree is also called a 
“bunch”. 
 
However, some collective nouns are 
specific to naming one kind of thing. 
For example, the term "fleet" always 
describes a group of vehicles such as 
a ‘fleet of ships’ and a ‘fleet of cars’. 
 
Collections of Things: 
 case of sardines 
 batch of cookies 
 cluster of grapes 
 ream of paper

The possessive form of a noun is 
used to show ownership or to describe 
an attribute.   
 
A singular possessive noun is used 
to show ownership by one person or 
thing.  The possessive of a singular 
noun is formed by adding an 
apostrophe (’) and the letter /s/ at the 
end of the word. 
 
Example:  the apple’s core 
 
A plural possessive noun is used to 
show ownership by more than one 
person or thing.  There are two rules 
for forming a plural possessive noun.   
 
1. If the plural noun ends with the  
    letter /s/, add an apostrophe (’) 
   after the /s/.   
   
Example:  The babies’ shoes 
 
Basic: Place students in groups. 
Have students play a game “Happy 
Families”. Have students collect an 
occupation card from the deck.  On 
the occupation card should be a 
picture of the character and three 
items that belong to that character 
that need to be collected.  The 
second deck of cards should 
contain pictures of the items to be 
collected.  These cards should be 
distributed evenly face down. The 
students should take turns asking 
their classmates if they have the 
items that belong to their characters 
using the correct possessive 
terminology.  
 
Example: The Speaker of the 
House would have his wig, robe, 
and the Mace of the House.  When 
asked, the student may reply as 
follows: “Sorry I do not have the 
Speaker’s wig.”

A pronoun is a word that takes 
the place of a noun.  
 
Examples:  I, he, she, we, 
they, us, it, you, me, her, him 
etc. 
 
A subject pronoun is a 
pronoun that can be used as 
the subject of a sentence  
 
Examples:  I, you, he she, it, 
we, they 
 
An object pronoun is used as 
the object of a verb or the 
object of a preposition. They 
are also called objective 
pronouns. 
 
Examples:  me, you, him, her, 
it, us, them 
 
An interrogative pronoun is a 
pronoun that is used when 
forming a question and it refers 
to a person or thing.

Possessive pronouns are 
pronouns that show ownership. 
Like all pronouns, they are 
substitutes for nouns or noun 
phrases. 
 
Examples of possessive 
pronouns are: mine, yours, 
his, hers, its, ours and theirs. 
 
Possessive pronouns do not 
need apostrophes. 
 
Example: 
That is Ava’s Alcatel phone.      
That is her Alcatel phone.   
That is hers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic: Have students select a noun 
and an object from a given list.  Have 
them write a sentence with a 
possessive pronoun to show that the 
subject selected owns the noun 
selected.  For example, if a student 
selects “baby” and “bottle”, the 
sentences that the student can write 
are: “The bottle belongs her.”  “The 
bottle is hers.”

a worksheet of several sentences 
that include errors related to 
possessive pronoun use. Instruct 
students to edit and rewrite each 
sentence, ensuring that the correct 
possessive pronouns are used.

Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
A verb is a word that tells what the subject 
of a sentence does, did or will do.  A verb 
can also express the state of being.   
 
An action verb is a word that expresses 
action.  
 
Example:   
The school of Jacks jumped out of the 
water to escape the approaching 
barracuda. 
 
Linking verbs do not express action. 
Instead, they connect the subject of the 
verb to additional information about the 
subject. 
 
Example:   
 Keila is a prefect.  
 Irene always feels tired after her dance 
routines. 
 
The following verbs are true linking verbs: 
am, is, are, was, were, become and 
seem.  
 
There are also verbs with ‘multiple 
personalities’: appear, feel, grow, look, 
remain, smell, sound, taste, and turn. 
Basic: Using a graphic 
organizer labelled “Action 
Verbs” and “Helping Verbs” 
have students categorize a list 
of verbs as helping or action 
verbs.   
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
read sentences and determine 
if the underlined verb is an 
action, helping or linking verb. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
read a paragraph about a 
national hero.  Have them 
identify the type of verbs that 
are underlined. 
 
Provide students with a 
paragraph.  Have them 
underline the verbs in 
the paragraph.  Have 
them place an ‘A”, “L”

verbs to indicate 
whether they are 
Action, Linking or 
Helping Verbs.

Sometimes these verbs are linking verbs; 
sometimes they are action verbs. To tell 
whether the verb is linking, substitute “is” 
in its place.  If it still makes sense, then 
the verb is behaving like a linking verb. 
 
Examples: 
The peas ‘n rice smells good!   
 Can “is” be substituted for “smells” and 
still make sense in the sentence?   
 The peas ‘n rice is good. 
 
The sentence still makes sense. “Smells” 
is a linking verb that connects peas ‘n rice 
with “good”.  
 
In the sentence “Felix smelled the peas ‘n 
rice cooking on the stove,” the word “is” 
cannot be substituted, as it would not 
make sense.  “Smelled” is an action verb 
in this case. 
 
Helping verbs come before main verbs 
and provide more details about the time of 
an action. Helping verbs include: has, 
have, had, can, does, shall, would, may 
and must. 
 
Example: 
The sea’s movements have been shaping 
our coastlines.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
The tense of a verb shows the 
time of an action. There are three 
basic verb tenses: past, present, 
and future. 
 
The present tense of a verb 
expresses an action that is taking 
place now or happens repeatedly. 
A verb written in the present tense 
needs to agree with the subject of 
the sentence.  
 
Example:  The volunteer assists 
us daily. 
 
The past tense of a verb 
expresses an action that took place 
in the past. Most past tense verbs 
end with an ‘ed’.  
 
Example:  The group of athletes 
walked for miles. 
 
Irregular verbs have special past 
tense forms which must be 
memorized.  
 
Example:  The girls bought tickets 
to the movie. 
Basic: Concentration Game 
Provide students with a list of 
verbs that form the past tense in 
an irregular manner.  Have 
students make cards that contain 
verbs and their irregular verb 
tense forms. Play the game by 
placing each card face down in 
even rows. Students can take 
turns turning two cards over. If the 
verb and its irregular past tense 
match, the player keeps the cards, 
and the winner is the person who 
has collected the most cards.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Good writing starts with well-
written sentences. A sentence 
has two parts: the complete 
subject and the complete 
predicate.  
  
The complete subject of a 
sentence includes the main noun 
or pronoun and the additional 
words that tell who or what the 
sentence is about. The subject is 
usually found at the beginning of 
the sentence.  
 
Example:  The major islands of 
The Bahamas are popular tourist 
destinations.  
 
However, the subject of an 
imperative sentence is often not 
written in the sentence. It is 
understood that the subject is 
‘you’. 
 
Example:  Take a moment to 
reflect on the sacrifices made by 
our ancestors.

Leading from their responses, write 
one declarative sentence that the 
students agree describes the main 
idea of the picture. Encourage them 
to add descriptive details. Ask 
students to then draw a line between 
the complete subject and the 
complete predicate of their sentence. 
Guide students to repeat the process 
using other newspaper pictures.

Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Adjectives are words that modify or 
describe nouns and pronouns. 
 
Authors use sensory adjectives to “show” 
their readers what they are talking about 
rather than just “telling” them with facts.   
 
Sensory words help the readers see, 
hear, feel – and sometimes even smell or 
taste what is being described.  
 
Example:  The conch fritters were deep-
fried in sizzling oil to a golden brown.  
Chunks of sweet green pepper, onions 
and conch caused its skin to bulge out in 
parts, giving some of the fritters odd 
shapes. Fritz dipped the hot fritter in a 
creamy sauce before placing a piece of 
it in his mouth.   
 
Adjectives may also be used to 
compare nouns and pronouns.   
 
There is the comparative form in which 
two nouns are being compared. When 
comparing two things add ‘er’ on to the 
word. 
 
Basic: Students should go on a 
nature walk around their school 
and write at least ten sentences 
about what they hear, see, and 
feel with the use of an adjective in 
each sentence.   
 
Intermediate: Give students 
sentences to complete with an 
adjective that compares.    
 
Example:  Andros is the _______ 
of all the Bahama Islands.  
 
Advanced: Students can read a 
short story containing no 
adjectives.  They can work in 
small groups to include adjectives 
to make the story more interesting 
and share it with the class. 
Students should ensure that they 
use different types of adjectives 
discussed such as demonstrative, 
proper and predicate adjectives.

on including 
adjectives in their 
composition writing.

more nouns, ‘est’ is added to the end of 
the word. 
 
Example: The ostrich is the tallest bird 
of all. 
 
The ostrich is being compared to all 
birds. 
 
The endings ‘er’ and ‘est’ are often used 
to compare adjectives with one syllable.  
 
‘More’ and ‘most’ are usually used to 
compare adjectives with two or more 
syllables.  Use more to compare two 
persons, places, or things. Use most to 
compare three or more persons, places,

An adverb is a word that gives more 
information about a verb, an adjective or 
another adverb.  It tells how, when, 
where or to what degree. 
 
Adverbs that tell how an action took 
place, often end in ly.   
Example:  gracefully, powerfully, 
skilfully, brilliantly, and cleverly. 
 
There are some adverbs that describe 
when something happens. This can 
also include how often and how long. 
 
When – frequently, eventually 
How often – periodically, frequently 
How long – momentarily, continuously 
 
Adverbs can also tell where.   
Example:  nearby, neighbouring, 
somewhere 
 
Adverbs can also indicate ‘to what 
degree’ or ‘to what extent’.  When 
comparing two things use ‘er’.  For 
more than two use ‘est’. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Provide the students will 
sentences that contain adverbs.  
Have them underline the adverbs.   
 
Intermediate:  Have students 
provide the adverb to complete 
sentences.   
 
Examples:   
1. Deirdre sang the song  ____. 
2. He runs  _____.  
3. Place the glass on the  
    table _____. 
 
Advanced:  Allow students to 
watch a television news report from 
one of the local stations.  Tell them 
that they have been given the job to 
review this report. They will 
describe what they saw and how 
they felt about it. They must be sure 
to include the different kinds of 
adverbs.

A preposition is a word placed before 
a noun to show its relationship to some 
other word in the sentence.  
Prepositions can tell location, 
direction, time, and relationships. 
Examples of commonly used 
prepositions are: about, above, across, 
after, against, around, at, before, 
behind, beneath, beside, between, by, 
despite, down, during, except, for, from, 
in, near, of, off, on, over, through, to, 
toward, under, up and with.  
Location  
The skilled diver swam into the depths 
of the Blue Hole. 
 
Direction  
The mouse bolted under the large 
container in the warehouse. 
 
Time  
Joshua did not go inside until the 
movie had started.   
 
Relationships  
Marjorie is going to the library with her 
brother. 
Basic:  Students can look at 
newspaper articles and highlight 
as many prepositions as they 
can find.  The student finding the 
most prepositions wins.  Mount 
their highlighted newspapers on 
the bulletin board.   
 
Intermediate:  Play the song, 
“Going Down Burma Road”, in 
small sections.  Ask students to 
listen closely for the 
prepositional phrases used in the 
song.  Have them make a list of 
the phrases and circle the 
preposition in each one.  Ask 
them to identify the words that 
are linked by the prepositions.   
 
Advanced: Have students 
design a Preposition Treasure 
Hunt for their classmates. They 
can work in groups to compose 
the instructions using 
prepositions.  
 
Example:  Look under the 
cupboard and behind the math 
books.  What have you found?  
Have students use 
prepositions in their 
composition writings 
to make their 
sentences more 
interesting.

A prepositional phrase includes the 
preposition, the object, and all the 
words that come between them.  The 
object of the preposition can be a noun 
or pronoun. 
 
Example: 
The skilled diver swam down into the 
depths of the blue hole. 
 
There are two prepositional phrases:   
 into the depths  
 of the blue hole. 
 
Sometimes words that appear on the 
list of prepositions may not actually 
perform the duty of a preposition in a 
sentence.  They must be followed by an 
object to be considered a preposition. 
 
Example: Fritz went outside.   
 The word outside is an adverb in 
this sentence telling where. 
 
Fritz went outside the classroom 
door.   
 The word outside now has the 
object ‘door’ and can be considered 
a preposition. 
 
 
Have students underline the 
prepositional phrases.

A compound preposition consists of two 
or more words that come together to 
behave like a one-word preposition. 
 
Examples: 
 up to 
 as of 
 in spite of

Coordinating Conjunctions join 
words, phrases, clauses, and 
sentences of equal rank. The 
coordinating conjunctions are: for, 
and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. 
 
Examples: 
Joining words 
Massive and mega are suitable 
synonyms for the word big. 
 
Joining phrases

Joining Sentences 
My grandmother has lots of elegant 
hats, but she never wears them! 
 
When a conjunction separates two 
sentences, a comma can be placed 
after the first sentence and before the 
conjunction as shown above.    
 
When coordinating conjunctions join 
two sentences into one, the sentence 
is called a compound sentence. 
 
Basic: Present students with specific 
scenarios.  Have students construct 
and orally present sentences using 
appropriate conjunctions about the 
scenarios.

independent clauses because they 
make a complete thought. 
 
In the sentence below there is a part of 
it that can stand alone. 
 
 Although Jake had an explanation, 
he remained quiet. 
 
 “He remained quiet” makes a 
complete thought and can stand 
alone.  This is an independent 
clause. 
 
Dependent clauses or subordinate 
clauses do not make a complete a 
thought. 
 
In the sentence below there is a part of 
it that cannot stand alone.

 “Although Jake had an 
explanation”, does not make a 
complete thought and is known as 
a dependent clause, because it 
needs the rest of the sentence to 
make sense.  It cannot stand on its 
own. 
 
The word ‘although’ in the sentence is 
known as a subordinating 
conjunction.  Subordinating 
conjunctions help to join a dependent 
clause to an independent clause.  
 
Dependent clauses are often 
separated from the rest of the 
sentence by a comma. 
 
There are various types of 
subordinating conjunctions:  because, 
since, if, when, until, while, after, as, 
whenever, before, although, unless,

Synonyms are words that have the

are valuable tools for readers and writers 
as they can make writing more 
interesting and enriching. 
 
Examples:

2. beautiful – attractive, stunning 
3. bossy – controlling, tyrannical 
4. funny – humorous, comical 
5. important – required, essential 
6. shy – introverted, bashful 
 
Words may have the same dictionary 
meaning, but certain synonyms have 
strong feelings and images attached. 
These words can impact the audience 
positively or negatively. For example, 
the synonyms ‘filthy’ and ‘unclean’ both 
describe something that is ‘dirty’. 
However, an object that is ‘filthy’ seems 
to be in a worse state than an object 
that is “unclean”. 
 
It is important that good readers and 
writers carefully select the correct 
synonym to invoke the right emotions 
and images.

Example:  Aunt Michelle 
 The first letter of important words 
in a title of a book, story, song, 
movie, etc.  
 The first word in a direct quotation  
 The first word in the salutation of 
a letter  
 The first word in the 
complimentary closing of a letter.  
 
Basic:  Tell students that they will be 
acting as capital detectives. Have 
students search the classroom and 
magazines for examples of where 
capital letters are used. In pairs, give 
learners the list of Capitalization 
Rules and challenge them to match 
the real-life examples collected to the 
rule explaining its use. Allow students 
to share findings.  
  
Intermediate:  Distribute a list of 
sentences with proper and improper 
capitalization usage. In groups, allow 
students to separate the examples 
and be prepared to explain why the 
sentences are either examples of 
correct capitalization rules or not.  
 
Advanced:  Have students write a 
letter to a friend about a country 
studied in Social Studies Unit 2 
(Australia, Brazil, Japan, 
Switzerland).  Encourage them to 
include names of places, people, and 
special events in the country. Allow 
learners to then edit their writing to 
ensure correct capitalization was 
used.   
Pre-Assessment 
(before teaching): 
Have students 
complete a worksheet 
designed to edit for 
capitalization errors. 
Let students document 
their scores in their 
notebooks. 
 
Post-Assessment 
(after teaching): Have 
students complete the 
same worksheet. Let 
students compare their 
new score with their 
pre-score. Have 
learners ask 
themselves: 
 
1. Did my score 
change? 
2. What would I do 
differently if I could 
have done this 
again?  
3. How will I use what I 
have learned?

Resources 
The five steps in the Writing Process 
are:  
 
Prewriting – The writer brainstorms 
ideas about a particular topic and 
organizes thoughts using a web or 
outline. 
 
Writing – The writer follows the 
outline and begins writing, by adding 
details to those ideas in the plan. 
 
Revising – The writer reads the essay 
and shares it with others to get their 
feedback.  The writer adjusts the 
essay, based on the feedback, and 
focuses on using more vivid 
vocabulary.  
 
Basic: Host a Writing Process 
Pageant.  Have students dress like 
a particular stage of the writing 
process and describe their 
costumes which should explain the 
step in the writing process. Add 
music and a runway so that 
students can model their costume 
for the class to see. Encourage 
students to be creative, but also 
focus on the including the correct 
content. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students work 
together in groups to compose a 
musical piece that explains one of 
the steps in the writing process.

There are four main reasons for 
writing:  to inform, to entertain, to 
describe and to persuade.  
Whatever the purpose, there are 
some basic qualities that are in all 
good pieces of writing. 
 
1. fresh and exciting ideas. 
2. captivating introduction 
3. vivid details 
4. well-organized with a distinct 
beginning, middle and end. 
5. keeping the audience in mind and 
answers any questions they may 
have 
6. written in a voice that connects 
with the readers 
7. interesting and advanced   
vocabulary that includes specific 
nouns and vivid adjectives. 
8. transitional words to keep the 
piece flowing 
9. different types of sentences with 
varying lengths 
10. correct grammar, spelling, and 
advanced punctuation. 
11. neat and well-presented

Present each group of “doctors” with 
a writing piece that is weak in one or 
two areas. The piece is referred to 
as the “patient.” Doctors in each 
ward must save their “patients” by 
ascertaining what is making the 
piece of writing sick, and then take 
measures to strengthen the piece. 
Select four passages 
and divide the class into 
four large groups.

Resources 
There are four main types of writing. 
They each serve a different purpose. 
 
1. Narrative Writing – This type of 
writing tells a story.  It is mainly 
written for entertainment. A 
personal narrative tells a story 
about you. 
 
2. Descriptive Writing – Uses 
figurative language and provides 
sensory details about a person, 
place, thing, or idea so that a 
clear picture is painted in the 
reader’s mind.  
 
3. Expository Writing – Provides 
information, gives an explanation 
or directions. 
 
4. Persuasive/Opinion Writing - 
This type of writing expresses 
how the writer feels about a 
particular subject and attempts to 
get others to feel the same way. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Have students listen to 
recorded commercials from the 
radio.  Have them decide the type of 
writing involved and give reasons for 
their choices.

groups to participate in the Different 
Types of Writing Amazing Race.  
Teachers will have to use a QR code 
generator to represent the different 
types of writing.  Place the QR codes 
around the school.  Have students 
use their devices to scan them to 
reveal a particular type of writing.  
Students should identify the type of 
writing and its location before 
returning their answer sheets to the 
teacher, who will record their times.  
 
Advanced:  Provide students with 
different written scenarios. For 
example, one that talks about the 
garbage on the beach after a 
holiday. Have students decide which 
type of writing might be necessary to 
address the issue, and then give 
reasons for their choices. 
Have students respond 
to oral questions on the 
four types of writing.

prewriting steps to follow: 
 
1. Generate ideas.  Strategies that 
can be utilized to help generate 
ideas include: peer discussions, 
brainstorming, grouping ideas that 
are alike, conducting research in 
textbooks or on the internet, talking 
to people who might be 
knowledgeable about the topic, 
conducting a survey, making a list 
etc. 
 
2. Select the best ideas.  Review 
the ideas and then select based on 
those that are most important, 
most interesting and have 
information that is readily 
available. 
 
3. Refine ideas.  Ask leading 
questions that will give specific 
details on which the writer can 
elaborate.  Who?  What?  When? 
Where? Why? How? 
 
 
Basic:  Have students list the 
national symbols that were

be an independent country.  They 
should refer to their Social Studies 
text for ideas.  Have them select 
one on which to write

order is very important when one is 
relaying a story, writing directions or 
instructions for performing a particular 
task or describing something.  The 
words we select to indicate sequence 
are very important.

An essay is divided into several 
paragraphs.  A good paragraph has a 
topic sentence that clearly states the 
main idea and details that support that 
idea.   
 
Good paragraphs also have transitional 
words and phrases that show clear 
relationships or connections between 
ideas, sentences, or paragraphs.  
There are three main types of 
transitions. They are transitions of time,

Narrative Writing – When telling a 
story, the topic sentence should 
indicate what the story will be about.  
The supporting details should all 
provide information related to that topic. 
Do not include unrelated information. 
 
Example:  The best line fishing 
experience happens after a storm.  
We had planned a fishing trip for the 
night leading into the Labour Day 
Holiday. We were all excited.  We had

chicken from KFC.  As we motored to 
our special fishing spot, just beyond 
Clifton Pier, we got caught in the worst 
storm ever.  Lighting flashed, thunder 
roared, and the sea produced giant 
waves that crashed on to the bow of the 
boat. We hunkered down under the tarp 
that we had in the boat. We were 
terrified!  The next morning after the 
storm passed, we threw our lines 
overboard.  Within seconds, all of us 
had beautiful snappers on our lines.  
This continued throughout the day.  We 
went home that day with a boatload of 
fish!

Descriptive Writing – The topic 
sentence should tell what is being 
described.  The supporting details 
should provide vivid descriptions of that 
person, place, thing, or animal. 
 
Example:  The new girl was a sight 
to behold!  Her uniform jumper was too 
tight and too short.  Her blouse was a 
crumpled mess beneath it.  Her hair 
was matted to her head like it had not 
been combed in weeks. She barely 
looked up as she took her seat. I 
wondered what her story was.  Did she 
not have someone to take care of her?  
 
Expository Writing:   
If your purpose is to inform your reader, 
then the topic sentence should clearly 
state the topic or what is being 
explained. Your supporting details 
should be facts and they should all be 
linked to the topic sentence. 
 
Example:  Queen Elizabeth II was a 
much-loved queen!  Her death at the 
age of 96 (after spending 70 years on 
the throne) was felt around the world, 
even in The Bahamas.  For example, all 
Anglican churches in The Bahamas

rang their bells 96 times to 
commemorate each year of her life.  
Also, the current and former Prime 
Ministers spoke of her humble attitude, 
her warm and kind nature, and her 
excellent memory. Finally, several of 
the Queen’s Medal recipients 
remembered how special it was to 
receive such an honour. 
Her passing has been felt in the hearts 
of many and indeed signals the end of 
an era. 
    
Persuasive Writing:  If the purpose is 
to persuade, then the topic sentence 
should clearly state the opinion of the 
writer on a particular topic and then 
have solid reasons in the details to 
support that viewpoint. 
 
Example: Reading daily for at least 
20 minutes a day will accelerate your 
ability to read at warp speed.  Just as 
athletes practice at least four to five 
times a week to improve their skills, you 
can do the same and experience great 
benefits.  Reading a wide variety of 
materials often will increase your 
vocabulary, as you will be exposed to 
new words.  Reading often will also

The introduction of an essay is key, as 
its function is to capture the attention 
of the readers, to draw them into the 
piece and to provide the topic 
sentence.  There are many ways to 
begin a piece.  The writer must decide 
which one would be best for the type 
of writing and the topic. 
 
 Begin with action.  Dwayne gave 
a loud scream, leaped over the 
fence, and sprinted towards his 
house. 
 
 Use onomatopoeia. Achoo! 
Achoo! Achoo! Melissa wiped her 
already red and swollen nose. 
 
 Use alliteration.  Proud, petty, 
and persistent were good words to 
describe old lady Simms. 
 
 Start with the end.  Kirk grimaced 
in pain as the ambulance doors 
closed shut. Why had he decided 
to steal that motorcycle? It had 
started out as a normal day.

various sounds in nature (waves 
crashing on the beach, howling 
wind, birds chirping etc.) and just let 
their imaginations take them away 
to that place.  Have them share 
what might be happening.  Have 
them create a story around the 
sounds.  They should use the 
sound(s) in the introduction of their 
writing pieces.

to songs about our Bahamian 
culture.  Discuss aspects of our 
culture with them.  Have then write 
about an aspect of our culture in 
which a tourist might be interested.  
Have them begin the piece with a 
question. 
 
Advanced:  Have students 
research reviews of tourists related 
to their visit to The Bahamas. This 
can be gathered using various 
travel websites.  Have them use 
this to write a piece on what we 
need to do to improve our tourism

The conclusion of a writing piece 
brings everything to an end in a way 
that is satisfying for readers. A good 
writer does not have to “announce” 
that it is the “end” but should move the 
readers through the piece in such a 
way that they realize the piece is 
concluding. 
 
There are several ways to conclude a 
piece of writing. 
 
 End with a quote.  Like Dr. Seuss 
says, “Why fit in, when you were 
born to stand out?” 
 
 Restate the topic sentence from 
the introductory paragraph in a 
different way.  If everyone would 
obey the laws of the road, we 
would have far less traffic 
accidents each year.

not introduce new ideas.  To

your class, either virtually or face-to- 
face. Have students interview the 
real-life author by asking general 
questions related to writing and 
specific ones on the process of 
writing conclusions. 
 
Intermediate:  Discuss the meaning 
behind several quotes that are 
familiar to the students.  Have them 
end a story using one of them. 
 
Advanced:  Have students read 
several pieces related to saving our 
natural resources, such as the 
grouper, conch etc.  Have students 
pay attention to how the pieces are 
concluded.  Have students write 
about a cause that they feel is 
important.  Have them use one of the 
types of conclusions discussed in 
their writing.

Objective 3.56 Demonstrate voice in their writing pieces by exploring tone and mood. 
 
Content 
Suggested Activities 
Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Voice refers to how much of the 
writer can be felt in a piece.  Is the 
writer interested and passionate 
about what is being written?  
 
The work of many famous authors 
can be recognized by their voice 
and writing style.  
 
The writer’s voice comes through 
in the tone and mood of the 
piece.  Tone refers to the feeling 
that an author creates.  Is the 
piece serious? Playful?  Angry? 
etc.  
 
The mood is the feeling that the 
reader gets after reading the 
piece.  Is the reader happy? sad? 
fearful?  It is important that the 
tone matches the messages that 
the writer is trying to send.  If the 
subject is serious for example, the 
language should not be light or 
funny. 
 
 
 
Basic:  Give students a particular 
scenario on which to write.  Have them 
share their pieces.  Discuss the different 
voices that are represented although 
they were all given the same scenario. 
 
Intermediate:  Have students re-enact 
their experiences with service at the 
Tuck Shop or a restaurant.  They should 
re-tell in such a way that the voice of the 
server is evident, such as frustrated, 
angry, etc.  Discuss the voices used with 
the class. 
 
Advanced: Have the class brainstorm a 
list of letters and notes that people might 
write and audiences for them. Make a 
three-column chart listing all types of 
letters and notes in the first column. In 
the second column, list the primary 
audiences for each of those types. Then, 
write a list of voices in the third column to 
match the right voice to each type of 
letter or note.

paragraph about 
something about 
which they are

The viewpoint from which material is 
written affects the voice.  Writing can 
be done from different perspectives.  
Be careful when writing that you do 
not move from one perspective to 
another. 
 
First Person – This perspective uses 
pronouns like I, me, my, mine, 
myself, and we to tell the story.  The 
story is only being told from one 
person’s perspective.  Because it is 
personal, an easy connection can be 
made with the reader. 
 
Second Person – This viewpoint 
uses pronouns like you and yours.  
The story is being told by someone 
who is looking on. 
 
Third Person – He, she, it, and they 
are used when writing from this 
perspective.  When writing from this 
viewpoint, you are the person who is 
looking on.  Readers get to 
experience the inner thoughts of the 
characters.   
 
Basic:  Have students watch an 
episode from a court case where 
witnesses are giving different 
accounts of an incident that 
happened.  Have students discuss 
their similarities and differences.  
Relate it to the different viewpoints in

Intermediate:  Have students visit 
the library to search for writing 
samples from different perspectives.  
Ask them to share with the class.  
Students can also look on-line for 
writing samples.

Poems have sounds. Two types of 
sounds found in poems are: alliteration 
and onomatopoeia. Alliteration is the 
repeating of beginning consonant 
sounds of words that occur close 
together. Many clichés are written as 
alliteration.  
 
Examples:  
 Jump for joy  
 Sweet smell of success 
 
Onomatopoeia refers to words that 
sound like the noises they make (buzz, 
crunch).

Suggested 
Assessment(s) 
Resources 
Writers often use dialogue in their 
narrative pieces to make them more 
interesting.  Quotation marks are used to 
set apart the exact words of the speaker 
from the rest of the sentence. One of the 
quotation marks appears at the 
beginning of what was said and the other 
at the end.  The first word in a quote is 
capitalized. 
 
Example: 
“Did Jason leave?” I asked. 
 
Commas are used to separate who is 
speaking from what is being said. The 
dialogue tag is the part that tells which 
character spoke and describes how they 
spoke.  
 
Example:  
 “Prince,” Karen questioned with a smile, 
“What is your favourite planet?” 
 
 The Dialogue Tag: Karen questioned 
with a smile. 
 
He shrugged his shoulders, “I did not see 
your bag!” he mumbled. 
 The Dialogue Tag: he mumbled. 
 
Basic: Have students place 
quotation marks and commas 
correctly in given sentences. Ask 
learners to circle the dialogue tag 
in each sentence.  
  
Intermediate:  Have students 
collect famous quotes and their 
authors that focus on popular 
themes such as honesty, hard 
work etc.  Assign them a piece of 
writing in which they are to use 
some of these quotes.  Have them 
use these quotes in their writing to 
make an interesting introduction, 
support a point, or conclude a 
piece. 
 
Advanced: Cut and paste a small 
section of chats from Zoom or 
Team’s class conversations.   
Have them write the conversation 
using appropriate grammatical 
conventions (quotation marks, 
commas, etc.). Encourage 
students to use various verbs and 
adverbs in the dialogue tags. 
 
Cartoon Strips: 
Collect several 
cartoon or comic 
strips that contain a 
lot of dialogue. In 
pairs, give students a 
strip to write the 
conversation using 
paragraphs and 
correct punctuation 
(quotation marks,

Challenge learners to 
use a variety of

Quotation marks are used to identify the 
title of a song or a piece of writing. The 
first quotation mark goes at the 
beginning of the title and the second 
quotation mark at the end of the title. 
 
Example: “Who Let the Dogs Out” is the 
name of a favourite Bahamian song by 
Baha Men.  
 
To increase the impact of their writing, 
writers often use familiar quotes or 
quotes from famous people to get the 
attention of the reader.  These quotes 
are set off by commas.  They begin with 
a capital letter and quite often a comma 
separates them from the rest of the 
sentence.

Narrative writing tells a story or part 
of a story. Narrative writing can be 
seen in short stories, biographies, 
autobiographies, essays, poems, 
and plays. A narrative essay should 
have an introduction, body, and a 
conclusion. The general 
characteristics of a narrative 
includes:  
 
 Characterization 
 Setting 
 Plot structure   
o Introduction  
o Development  
o Conclusion  
  
Characters are the people or 
animals in a story.  The protagonist 
is the word used to describe the 
hero. The antagonist is the villain in 
the story. Time should be spent 
developing descriptions of major 
characters.  Use specific words to 
describe some of their unique 
physical characteristics as they 
relate to their faces, hair, and 
bodies. (See Grade 4 Curriculum) 
Basic: Have students spend 
time developing particular traits 
of characters for a story that they 
will write.  They can look at 
pictures from magazines etc. 
and develop a character from 
them.  Have them include these 
traits in their story (physical 
features, facial features, 
movement etc.). 
 
Intermediate: Have students 
watch video clips depicting the 
preparation made for a general 
election (dissolving of 
parliament, election day 
announced, nomination day, 
campaigning etc).  Have them 
write a story from the voter’s 
point of view. They should 
interview an actual voter to help 
with ideas.  Special attention 
should be given to describing the 
setting, characters in the story 
and developing the plot in a 
seamless way.  Suggestions for

reader to visualize what the writer is 
describing.

writer should end with a concluding 
thought about the thing, place or person 
that was described.    
 
There are several strategies that 
authors use when writing descriptively.  
The words that are used to describe, 
should be carefully selected so that 
they convey detailed images to the 
readers. 
 
 
Basic: Display a poorly written 
descriptive essay. Have students 
evaluate its ‘descriptive strength’, 
using a rubric.  As a whole class, 
have students revise and re-write 
this descriptive essay using literary 
devices and other descriptive 
details. Have them re-score the 
passage. 
 
Intermediate: Caterpillar Essays 
In groups of five (5), provide 
students with a mediocre 
descriptive essay to read and rate. 
Each student is given lined sheet 
in the shape of a circle.  Have 
them choose one of the 
paragraphs to revise, by adding 
sensory details, vivid words, 
literary devices etc.) to improve its 
interest and quality. Have students 
write their new paragraph on their 
circles and publish their essays by 
connecting their five circles with 
paper clips. Groups can orally 
present. Peers can critique. 
 
Have students write 
a descriptive essay.  
Use a rubric to 
evaluate their work.  
Provide feedback.

 Show Me, Don’t Tell Me is a 
strategy that authors use.  For 
example, instead of saying that a 
person is afraid, authors show that a 
person is afraid. 
 
Example: 
Robert’s voice began to tremble, 
as his lips quivered, and his 
saucer-like eyes shifted to the door 
that was slowly beginning to open. 
 
 Sensory details are words used to 
appeal to the five senses. They also 
include describing emotions and 
attitudes. 
  
Example: 
Madison, a one-year-old Labrador 
dog with a black, shiny coat, was 
hungry.  Directly opposite her was 
food, but one thing stood between 
her and the delightful delectables, 
Max, the biggest dog in the yard.  
Madison moved closer to the plate, 
inch by inch.  When she was close 
enough, she leaned over.  Huge 
globs of saliva fell to the ground.

 Literary Devices are also used as a 
tool for making writing interesting.  
There are several of them that can 
be used. 
 
o Similes are comparisons that 
use like or as. 
Example:  He ran as fast as a 
hungry cheetah. 
  
o Metaphors are comparisons that 
do not use like or as. 
Example:  Shaunae Miller Uibo 
is a cheetah in the 400m race. 
  
o Alliteration is repeating the 
beginning consonant sound in 
two or more consecutive words. 
Example:  Dorothy’s dog Ditto 
dangled in the wind.  
  
o Onomatopoeia refers to words 
that are actual sounds Example:

include the following: 
 
 The heading - This includes the 
address of the sender and the date. 
It is normally written in the right-hand 
corner at the top of the page. 
  
 Salutation or Greeting - This is the 
way to identify to whom the letter is 
being written. It usually begins with 
“Dear”.  A comma follows the name 
of the person to whom you are 
writing.

considered the main part of the letter. 
Include all the interesting details 
about family and friends and write 
about what you have been doing

ORAL PRESENTATION RUBRIC 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the oral presentation skills of students in Grades 4-6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors 
are so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: content and delivery. This gives flexibility of use, as teachers and students can decide whether to focus on one aspect 
of an oral presentation or both sections.

USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEACHING OF READING 
 
 
THE READING PROCESS  
 
The reading process aims to provide readers with a systematic framework to monitor and guide their thinking, understanding, 
and response to a text. The overarching goal is for learners to eventually apply this process with automaticity inside and outside 
the classroom environment. However, to achieve this goal, readers must have multiple opportunities to observe this process 
being effectively applied to various texts and be allowed to use this method with guided support.  
 
The following Guide Steps for The Reading Process can be placed on individual bookmarks or posted on a classroom chart 
for ease of reference by students.

o Do I need to re-read any 
confusing parts? 
o Can I see a clear picture in my 
mind of what is being shared? 
o Are the illustrations helping me to 
 Summarize and reflect on the main 
ideas of what you read. Ask yourself: 
o Did I learn any new information or 
ideas? 
o Do I have any burning questions 
left unanswered about this topic? 
 
 Connect it to your real life. Ask 
yourself: 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something else I read? 
o Do these ideas remind me of 
something I have experienced 
before?

BEFORE READING THE TEXT 
DURING READING OF THE TEXT 
AFTER READING THE TEXT 
text may be about.  
 
 
Think about what you may learn, 
feel, or encounter in this text. 
 
understand what I am reading? 
o Were my predictions correct? If 
not, what is my new prediction? 
 
 Figure out only important unknown 
words. Ask yourself: 
 Are there any context clues or 
word parts to help me figure out 
the meaning?    
 Evaluate what you read. Ask 
yourself: 
o Did I agree or disagree with these 
ideas? 
o Have I changed my mind or 
feelings about this topic? If so, 
why? 
 
 
*NOTE: Pay careful attention to the student’s responses here and determine if the reader has sufficient background 
knowledge about the topic to understand what is about to be read. If it seems that the reader does not, pause here and 
provide learning experiences to build knowledge before reading.  
 
 
BASAL READERS 
 
The basal reading approach to reading instruction according to Morin, 2020 is, “…usually a grade-levelled series of 
textbooks...focuses on teaching reading, either by code-emphasis approach (phonetic) or meaning-emphasis approach 
(reading for understanding).”  The basal reading programme provides systematic guidance for teachers using age-appropriate 
reading material and includes all aspects of word attack skills, sequential development of word recognition, comprehension 
skills, and vocabulary skills.  
 
Examples of Basal Readers are:  
 
 Harcourt Trophies 
 Story Town 
 Journeys 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 286 
 
 Scott Foresman 
 Reading Street 
 
THE LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE APPROACH 
 
The Language Experience Approach can be utilized in conjunction with or independent of a basal reading series.  This 
approach can particularly be used to support instruction with struggling readers.  This approach consists of creating an 
experience for students and then discussing the experience with them.  The teacher would record what they have said on the 
board or chart paper.  Students would then read the story.  This approach provides for an integration of all the Language Arts 
components (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and helps the children to see relationships.  
 
 
TYPES OF READING 
 
Oral Reading: 
 
Suggested Checklist for Oral Reading 
 
The checklist can be used to guide the teacher’s observations as he/she listens to and observes the students as they read 
orally. The students should be given a chance to read the selection silently before they read it orally.  The checklist also helps 
the teacher to determine the students’ specific skill needs.  
  
Sample Checklist 
1. Determines the mood or tone of the selection (humour, sadness, excitement, suspense, etc.) 
2. Reads in thought phrases or units. 
3. Observes punctuation marks. 
4. Reads smoothly without jerkiness or hesitation. 
5. Uses appropriate volume. 
6. Enunciates clearly and distinctly 
7. Uses a suitable pitch and voice quality. 
8. Is free from strain, tension or nervous habits. 
9. Reads at an appropriate rate so the listeners can understand. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 287 
 
10. Does not omit, substitute, repeat, or insert words. 
11. Holds the book properly. 
12. Keeps place when reading without difficulty. 
 
Guided Reading: 
 
Guided Reading focuses on developing readers’ ability to independently apply both strategies and skills in context. Readers are 
arranged in groups of four to six based on their instructional reading level and provided more targeted reading instruction and 
support. The instructional sessions are focused on the students’ use of multiple strategies or skills in context.  
 
BASIC ROUTINE FOR USING GUIDED-READING INSTRUCTION 
1. 
Conduct a diagnostic assessment of readers. 
5. Provide direct instruction or coaching on a specific 
strategy or skill. 
2. 
Group students according to their reading levels. 
6. Offer meaningful activities to the rest of the class while 
engaged with a group. 
3. 
Select a variety of texts at the instructional level for each 
group. 
7. Conduct ongoing reading-level assessments to track 
progress. 
4. 
Allow students during group sessions to read the entire 
text or sections. 
8. Provide individual or peer-led instruction to students who 
require further instruction. 
 
 
SILENT READING 
 
Functional Reading: 
 
As students progress in their abilities to decode printed symbols, their readings about the content subjects and daily living 
experiences become increasingly important.  The student encounters basic texts and supplementary texts in Social Studies, 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 288 
 
Science, and Arithmetic, as well as many others.  The more highly specialised the subject matter becomes, the more demand 
for reading skill mastery.  
 
Recreational Reading: 
 
The reading programme provides both the development of reading skills and the encouragement of reading for pleasure. 
Recreational reading involves students selecting material to be read for personal satisfaction.  A lifetime interest in good books 
comes from the repeated discovery that reading many kinds of books is satisfying.  To foster recreational reading, the teacher 
must know children’s books, know the students’ abilities and interests, and be ready to help students find the right books at the 
right time.  Learning students should be exposed to a wide range of subject matter and the wide gradation of difficulty that can 
be found in library collections.  Teachers should ensure that they maintain interesting classroom libraries and encourage 
students to visit their school libraries. 
 
THE READING LEVELS  
 
 Independent: The highest level at which a child can read with at least a 95% accuracy rate and a 90% comprehension 
rate.  
 
 Instructional: The child can read with an accuracy rate that is between 90% - 94% and can understand the information 
with at least a 75% comprehension rate. 
  
 Frustration: The student is reading with less than 90% accuracy and has less than 75% comprehension rate.

SAMPLE READING ENRICHMENT DAY MENU 
 
The Power of Choice! People are naturally more motivated to participate in an activity when given individual choice, and 
learning strategies are built on this tendency. They are flexible enough to be used with any content, ability, or grade level. Here 
is a sample of a Reading Learning Menu that can be used on Enrichment Day. Students are to complete all activities from the 
‘Must Do’ category and choose reading activities from the ‘Can Do’ category according to their preference. 
 
MUST DO 
CAN DO 
In a nutshell 
 
Read a literary piece. 
Write a 10-word summary 
of the pages (or book) you 
have just read. 
Perfect Prediction 
 
Start a new book. Before 
you begin, make three 
predictions based on the 
front cover. 
Setting 
 
Draw a picture of the setting 
of a book you read. 
Locate Them 
 
As you read, underline the 
nouns, circle the adjectives, 
and highlight the action 
verbs. 
Vlog 
 
Read a book, and then 
make a video, giving a 
summary of the book. Be 
prepared to share your 
video with the class. 
Focus 
 
Sit quietly and listen to a 
recording on television or 
the news, and then write 
five sentences about what 
you understood and heard. 
Illustrator 
 
Read a book, and then 
design a front cover for it.

DAILY ROUTINE FOR VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION 
 
Vocabulary is the gateway to comprehension, and greater word knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding of a text. While 
this is true, it is impossible to teach the meaning of every word to students. Therefore, vocabulary instruction in the classroom 
should be reserved for words that would have the greatest impact on the comprehension of a text. When learning the meaning 
of an unknown word, the definition is only the first step. Students must have multiple opportunities to engage with the word and 
be able to use it in different forms and contexts. Below is a basic 5–10-minute daily routine for vocabulary instruction for 
unknown words:

DAY 3

DAY 5

DEEPENING WORD 
KNOWLEDGE 
GAMES 
DISCUSSION / 
PRESENTATION 
Give direct instruction 
on the meaning of the 
word. Provide 
descriptions, 
illustrations, and 
examples of the word 
usage in everyday life. 
 
Allow students to use 
pictures, words, or body 
movements to 
represent its meaning, 
description, 
explanation, or 
example. Encourage 
creativity. 
Provide vocabulary 
activities to deepen the 
experience (examples / 
non-examples, 
analogies, related 
words, word parts, 
compare and contrast 
meanings with other 
words, etc.). 
Play vocabulary games 
with the focused words 
and other familiar 
words. 
Have students present 
their understanding of 
the word and its usage 
to a partner or another 
audience. Encourage 
creativity. 
NEXT STEP: The new vocabulary can now be added to the classroom word wall or the students’ personalized spelling log. Be 
sure to continuously revise these words in a fun way!

UPPER PRIMARY SCHOOL: HANDWRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRIC 
OVERALL LEGIBILITY 
 
The following rubric is intended to be used by the teacher and serves two main purposes. It is designed to provide a numerical 
grade when assessing the legibility of students’ writing in Grades 4 to 6. Additionally, because its performance descriptors are 
so detailed, teachers can use them to provide corrective and specific feedback to students. The rubric is divided into two 
sections: letter formation and presentation. This gives flexibility of use, as teachers and students can focus on one aspect of 
their handwriting or both sections during assessments.
