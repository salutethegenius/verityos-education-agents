DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  PRIMARY CURRICULUM SECTION  
NATIONAL PACING GUIDE – GRADE 6 
THE ACADEMIC YEAR 2024-2025  
  
  
 
INTRODUCTION:    
The National Pacing Guide promotes a standardized approach to implementing the curriculum. It aims to identify the topics to be taught at each grade level, show the order in 
which they should be presented and provide a guide on how much time should be spent on a particular topic.  Students transferring from one public school to another should not 
be disadvantaged by the move, since each school should be following the topics as laid out in the guide.  This document also identifies the core and advanced topics at each 
grade to assist teachers with planning for targeted instruction, particularly when schooling is interrupted due to natural disasters, pandemics, etc.   
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:    
The National Pacing Guide does not take the place of The National Curriculum Documents.  Both of these documents should be used in tandem with each other. 
 
NEW ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GUIDE:  
Each year, the pacing guide is refreshed based on the completion of new curriculum documents and teachers’ feedback.  This year is no exception.  Focus Groups were held 
during the Summer Workshops to garner feedback and suggestions from teachers on the pacing guide.  Additionally, in the case of Mathematics, in depth sessions were held 
with selected teachers from each grade level to reframe the layout of the Math.   
 
This year we are also seeking to give more prominence to Junkanoo in the curriculum. Included in the month of November are examples of how Junkanoo can be intentionally 
integrated into classroom instruction.  Sample activities have been included on the pacing guide.  A separate document will be circulated providing more information on this 
initiative.  Below are some of the other highlights for 2024-2025.  
 
LANGUAGE ARTS  
 
Building literacy and numeracy skills remains the major focus during the first term (grades 1-3). 
 
There is a now a formal Reading Framework in place for grades 4-6.  It follows a similar pattern as the Reading Block at the lower primary level.   The Reading Block has 
been adjusted to include oracy and fluency.   Additionally, the skills and strategies covered during Listening and Speaking instruction should be consistently practised in 
all subject areas.  
 
Fluency has been further refined to include suggested activities.  Students will be formally assessed to determine their fluency levels in September and May of this 
school year.  
 
The subject “Spelling” has been renamed “Word Study” and incorporates Phonics instruction.  Student performance should be documented as one grade under “Word 
Study” on the report card. 


 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       2024-2025 GRADE SIX PACING GUIDE | Page  2        
 
 
The Reading Routines, an additional resource (labelled R.R. on the pacing guide) that provides guidance on the teaching of Reading, is referenced throughout this 
document.     
 
MATHEMATICS 
 
The sequencing and timing of certain Math topics have been altered to enhance instructional delivery.   
 
Focus numbers have been identified. These numbers are to be revisited regularly to aid in retention. They should be integrated through counting, identifying and 
writing drill practices.  
 
Basic drills have been included.  These should be consistently executed before each lesson for reinforcement.   
 
Key words are to be displayed on word walls, taught during instruction, and used in context to build students’ Math vocabulary.   
 
SOCIAL SCIENCE 
 
The subject “Social Science” will be taught beginning the Easter Term using the topics that have been identified for that term.  Please note that Social Science topics 
will appear on the pacing guide for the Christmas Term for information purposes only.  If teachers have an opportunity to integrate the Social Science topics into 
the Language Arts and Math, they are encouraged to do so.  There will be no Social Science grades on the report card for the first term.  
 
SOCIAL STUDIES 
 
 
Links to videos developed by the Innovation Unit, which correspond with the various lessons, have been included.  These videos can be used to reinforce what was 
taught, for lesson reviews, as home work assignments and can also be incorporated into learning center activities.   
 
As The GLAT exam covers content from grades 4-6, teachers can assign weekly videos from previous grades for students to review to keep the information in the 
forefront. 
.    
  
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE:  
 
As you work through this document, please be mindful of the following:  
 
 
This document is a guide.  It was built to reflect what the average student should be able to complete in a given year.  Some students are expected to advance faster, while 
others may need additional time on certain topics.   
 
o    CORE/MANDATORY TOPICS: All core topics have been identified WITH an asterisk and should be covered within the school year. These topics should be the focus 
of End of Year Examinations. 
    
o    ADVANCED TOPICS: All topics WITHOUT an asterisk can be integrated into lessons or completed by students performing above grade level.  
 


 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       2024-2025 GRADE SIX PACING GUIDE | Page  3        
 
 
It is expected that once topics are taught, they will be constantly reinforced and integrated into other subject areas.  This strategy can be used as a form of review and to 
provide further support for students who may be struggling with particular topics.  This document's layout allows for topics across all subject areas to be easily identified.  
 
 
Time has generally been allocated, particularly at the beginning of the year and around midterm, to allow for the establishing of those important classroom routines, the 
administering of assessments, and review of those topics that were previously taught.  
 
 
The page numbers that follow the topics reflect where information can be found in the corresponding curriculum documents.  If “TB” appears before the page number, then 
that information can be found in the national textbook for that subject area.    
 
 
The names of current curriculum officers and their email addresses have been included on the last page of this document.  Your questions and feedback are welcome.  
Some questions to consider when providing feedback are: Did the sequence of topics work well?  Was sufficient time allocated?  
 
 
Officers will place updated information and activities in the Professional Learning Community (PLC) via the TEAMS group. This community was especially formed to 
engage primary teachers in public schools.  Please ensure that you access it at least once or twice a week.  Currently, there are many activities and videos that teachers can 
utilize.  Teachers are also invited to share activities and resources in this space that they have found worked well, students’ responses to certain activities and any questions 
they may have.  If you are not already a member of the PLC, you may ask a school administrator how to join or contact any of the officers listed at the back of this document.
