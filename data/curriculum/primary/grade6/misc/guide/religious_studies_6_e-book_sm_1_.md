GRADE 4
God, The Creator
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Creation reveals the beauty of God in many ways. The vast blue sky reminds us that God
is great. The sun, moon and stars reveal that God is light. The colourful flowers and
birds reveal that God is beautiful. The order of the planets reveal that God loves order.
Everything works in harmony to show us that God loves unity.  
The Bible expresses truths about the beauty of God’s creation. Genesis 1 verse 31
tells that everything God made was very good. Psalm 19 verse 1 states that the
sky reveals God’s glory. Genesis 1: 26 -27 states that God made man in His
image and likeness. 
We can demonstrate the beauty of God’s creation in many ways. We can
observe the splendor of nature and design paintings and murals. We can reveal
the beauty of creation in words of poetry and song. We should show respect for
all God has created. Most of all human beings should display the beauty of
God’s creation by being loving, peaceful and kind.

The Nature of God 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 201 - 202
       God is a Supreme Being, meaning highest in rank or authority.
He is a sovereign being. He is supreme in knowledge and wisdom
(Proverbs 21:30). First Chronicles 29:11-12 describes God as Head
above all things. God has no beginning or ending. In a contest with
Elijah and the prophets of Baal, God proved that He was a
Supreme Being  (1 Kings 18). 
       God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibenevolent
and eternal. Omnipotent means mighty and all powerful.
Omniscient means He has infinite knowledge and understanding of
the past, present and future. Omnipresent means everywhere at
the same time. Omnibenevolent means allloving. Eternal means
His nature is without beginning or end. 
        Christians believe that God is a Trinity of Persons. This means
that God is one but operates in the form of three divine persons:
“God, the Father”, “God, the Son”, and “God, the Holy Spirit”. Each
performs a specific work. Scriptures about the Trinity include John
14:26 and Eph. 3:14-17. 
       When Christians worship, they honour the Trinity – Father, Son
and Holy Spirit. They worship God by the power of His Spirit (John
4:24). They sing songs about the Trinity like, “Holy, Holy”. They pray
in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Jesus Christ the Son of God
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The names of Jesus Christ reveal His identity. He is the
Good Shepherd who guides and cares for His children.
Jesus is the Bread of Life; to live spiritually, abundantly and
eternally we need Jesus. He is our Saviour who gave His life
for the salvation of man (John 3:16). 
There are many scriptures that reveal that Jesus Christ is
God’s Son. In Luke 1:32, the angel said that Jesus was the
Son of the Highest. In Matthew 3:17, during Jesus’ baptism,
God spoke from heaven and said that Jesus was His
beloved Son. Again in Matthew 17:5 at the Transfiguration,
God said, “This is my beloved Son, listen to Him.” 
Mankind sinned when Satan deceived Adam and Eve into
eating the forbidden fruit. This brought death into the world
and placed a barrier between God and man. After the “Fall
of Mankind,” God promised to send Jesus Christ to save
mankind from sin.
We should always show appreciation to Jesus Christ our
Saviour. We can show appreciation through songs such as
“Give Thanks”. The scripture, 1 Corinthians 15:57 encourages
us to give thanks to God “for the victory through Jesus
Christ.” We can show gratitude for Jesus by sharing His love
with others.

Miracles and Teachings 
of Jesus Christ 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Miracles are extraordinary and astonishing happenings
performed by God through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus performed
miracles to reward people because of their faith, to show
compassion, to demonstrate God’s power at work and to
convince persons that He was God’s Son. Jesus healed the lame,
blind, sick, deaf and others. 
While on Earth, Jesus Christ taught many people through
parables. A parable is an earthly story with a spiritual message
or moral. In the parable of the “Prodigal Son,” Jesus teaches us
about God’s love and forgiveness. The parable also teaches us
about the unconditional love of a father for his son and how
parents should not give up on their children. 
Jesus Christ chose twelve disciples to work with Him. A disciple is
a learner or follower. 
Characteristics of a disciple are: 
Being born again (John 3.3)
Having a prayerful life (Luke 6:12)
Being a good listener  (Matthew 17:5)
Showing love and obedience (John 8:12, Mark 12:30)
Willing to be a witness and serve (Matthew 28:19, John 12:26)
Willing to suffer for Jesus’ sake (Philippians 1:29)
Matthew 16:24 states: “Deny yourself, take up your cross and
follow me.”

 The Holy Spirit
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Individuals should seek to honour the Holy Spirit in their daily
lives. We honour the Holy Spirit by listening to His voice as He
teaches and guides us. We must follow His instructions and be
obedient. We must do what is pleasing to God so that the
Holy Spirit can dwell in our temples (1 Cor. 3:16). We must
produce spiritual fruit (Gal. 5:22-23). We must also honour the
Spirit in worship. 
The Holy Spirit helps believers in the many ways. He comforts
and strengthens individuals. He reveals truth about God (John
14:17), and teaches believers (John 14:26). He helps us to
believe in God and strengthen our faith. He empowers
believers (Acts 1:8). He also helps us when we pray (Romans
8:26).  
The Holy Spirit is the third person in the Trinity. God is three
divine persons in one: Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy
Spirit. The Bible states that there are three that testify in
heaven, the Father, the Word (Jesus) and the Holy Spirit (1
John 5:7). The Holy Spirit is also known as the Comforter or
Advocate (John 14:16) and the Spirit of Truth (John 14:17).

The Fruit of the Spirit 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Christians develop faith, meekness and temperance through
their daily experiences. Faith comes by hearing God’s word
and believing, nurturing a prayer life and never giving up.
Meekness comes through service and knowing who you are.
Temperance comes when you keep calm, speak slowly and
meditate on Scripture.  
The fruit of the Spirit is seen in individuals who are disciples
of Jesus Christ. Galatians 5: 22-23 states, “But the Fruit of
the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness,
goodness, faith, gentleness, self-control. Against such,
there is no law." When Christians display the Fruit of the
Spirit, they truly reflect who Jesus is.  
The Bible gives us examples of individuals who displayed faith,
meekness and temperance. Ruth, the Moabite was an example of
unwavering faith and bravery. After being widowed early in life, she
stayed with her mother-in-law and followed God the rest of her life.
David displayed selfcontrol when he didn’t kill Saul, even though he
had opportunity to do so. Moses was called the meekest man on
earth. He was slow in speech and thought he would not make a
good leader. We can certainly learn from their examples.

The Bible, Our Guide 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Bible is a sacred book that reveals God’s love for the world. Some writers
have called the Bible God’s love letter to us. Isaiah 54:10 speaks about God’s
faithful love. Psalm 86:15 tells us about God being very patient and full of
faithful love. First John 4:7- 8 reminds us that love comes from God.
Follow the Golden Rule and treat
 others with the same respect as w
e want them to treat us. We must lo
ve our enemies and not seek reve
nge (Luke 6:27-31).
Follow the Beatitudes - Become
 humble, merciful, pure in heart an
d peacemakers (Matt. 5: 3- 10). 
Do not judge others - Luke 6:37-
 42 tells us that we should not judg
e others. Judging is condemning 
or holding unfair thoughts ab
out others. We should examine our l
ives daily so that we do not come 
under God’s judgment. 
Christians use the Bible for guidance
every day. It offers advice on
different areas of life, such as
making choices, eating healthily,
loving others and setting goals. It
provides promises and prayers to
live by. The Bible also provides
teachings for spiritual growth.
Christians should apply the following
teachings to their lives:

The Book of Books 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 213- 214
The New Testament is a record of Jesus Christ’s life and teachings.
It is a collection of twenty-seven books. The first four books of
the New Testament, the Gospels contain the story of Jesus’ life
and teachings. The other books were written by followers of Jesus
who shared His teachings and continued Jesus’ work. 
       Gospel means ‘good news.’ The  
       Gospels are Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John. Acts is the book of history. 27
letters were written by Paul, Peter and
others. Revelation is a book of
prophecy about future events. 
There are important truths in the
Gospels, letters and the book of
prophecy. The Gospels teach us that
Jesus was God’s Son, He died for the
sins of man and was resurrected from
the dead. In the letters we find
instructions on what Christians should
believe, how to live and how to treat
people. Revelation tells about Jesus
and His second coming.
The New Testament contains the
history of the Early Church found in
the book of Acts. Jesus started the
church with a group of one hundred
twenty (120) believers. While in
Jerusalem, they were filled with the
Holy Spirit. Peter preached a
message and over three thousand
(3000) people were added to the
church. 
The Books of the New Testament are
classified as Gospels, history, letters
or prophecy.

Who Am I? 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Individuals develop their sense of right and wrong by:  
Listening to the voice that directs them,
Reading God’s Word and knowing what is right 
Confessing when they do wrong
Doing good deeds
Even though human beings are all equal, they are not treated
with equity or fairness. Society places people at different levels
based on their race, nationality or wealth. In some countries,
people do not have the basic resources they need to live a good
life. 
Some children live in poverty and do not have food, clothes, and
access to a good education. People must be treated with equity
and given the resources they need to succeed. We must be
guided by our conscience and do what is right. 
Human beings were created with a conscience or inner sense
of right and wrong. This helps us to make moral or good
choices. Whenever an individual attempts to do something
wrong, he or she will hear a “voice” telling him or her not
to do wrong (Isaiah 30:21) 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 215 - 216

Our Gifts and Talents  
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
There are many biblical and modern-day characters who
have used or today use their talents well. In the Bible, Dorcas
was known for her good works and acts of charity. Today,
persons like Shaunae Miller-Uibo use their talents in sports.
Hon. Cynthia “Mother” Pratt and Mrs. Elma Garraway use
their talents to help build the youth of our nation. 
Individuals can use their gifts/talents to help them make
decisions about future careers. Individuals who are
mathematically gifted can become teachers, engineers and
architects. Those who have musical abilities can become
singers, musicians and song writers. 
Athletic abilities can lead to careers in sports. Speech and
language abilities can lead to careers in teaching,
journalism, public speaking and politics. Gifts and talents
can lead to many career choices. 
Gifts are the natural talents, abilities or qualities one possesses.
All gifts come from God and every person has a gift or gifts.
Some people have musical, mathematical, artistic or athletic
talents/abilities. Gifts and talents are important for an
individual’s growth, self-esteem, career and life in general.

It’s Harvest Time Again
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Harvest has been a season of rejoicing from biblical times. It brings families
together in times of worship. Harvest involves two main areas: “God's provision
for us and God's blessing for others. While we celebrate a harvest season just
once a year, we experience the spirit of harvest all the time.” “Life is about
sowing and reaping.” 
Both Harvest and the American Thanksgiving are for the purpose of giving thanks
to God for the harvest. God commanded Israel to celebrate harvest festivals to
give thanks for their crops. The Pilgrims started Thanksgiving in America in 1621,
after a difficult winter the previous year, to celebrate a bountiful harvest. 
Today, in the Christian church we celebrate Harvest by giving thanks to God for
all of His blessings. People bring food items to share with the needy. Bahamians
also celebrate Thanksgiving with family gatherings and the eating of turkey and
ham. 
Celebrating special days and festivals is very important. We celebrate special days like
birthdays and weddings, in order to recognize milestones in life, bring people together
and create lasting memories. The Christian church celebrates special festivals like
Christmas and Easter to remember the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.

 The Birth of Jesus Christ -
Christmas
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The following prophetic names refer to Jesus Christ: Immanuel - God with
us (Isaiah 7:14); Messiah/Christ - Saviour or the Anointed One (Dan. 9:25)
; Son of the Most High God (Luke 1:32); Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty
God, Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6). 
If Jesus Christ had not fulfilled prophecy, life would be more difficult and
without true meaning. We would all be sinners without hope of eternal life
(John 3:16). Our lives would be unhappy, without joy, peace and love.
Jesus came that we might have abundant life (John 10:10). We would be
walking in darkness without Jesus, the Light of the World (John 8:12).
Without Jesus there would be no miracles and teachings of the New
Testament for Christians to live by. 
When Jesus Christ was born, many prophesies concerning Him were fulfilled.
Jesus was born as a child/son according to the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6. He
was born of a virgin according to Isaiah 7:14. He was born in Bethlehem
according to the prophecy in Micah 5:2. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 221 - 222

GRADE 4
Created to Worship
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Holy Spirit helps us to worship God reverently and sincerely. Romans 8:14-
16 reveals that the Holy Spirit motivates us to worship and give honour to
God. He helps us to make melody in our hearts and sing spiritual songs
(Ephesians 5:19). We must sing praises to God with our mind and our spirit (1
Corinthians 14:15). 
Jesus Christ shared important teachings about worship. In John 4:22-24,
Jesus states that God is Sprit and is seeking “true worshipers” to worship the
Father “in spirit and in truth.” This means that when we worship, we should
worship God with pure hearts and according to His will.
When we worship God reverently and sincerely, He will not withhold any good
thing from us. In Exodus 23:25, God told the Israelites that if they worshipped
Him, He would bless them “with food and water and take away all their
sicknesses.” Worship awakens the soul and inner being (Ps. 103:1). We become
truly humble in God’s presence (Ps. 95:6). Worship turns sadness into hope
(Ps. 42:11). Individuals are changed and become better as they worship God
(2 Cor. 3:18). 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 223 - 224
14


Teach Us to Pray
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Sometimes our prayers may not be answered. Sin prevents our
prayers from being answered (Psalm 66:18). An unforgiving
spirit also hinders our prayers (Mark 11:25). Unbelief can be a
hindrance according to Matthew 21:22. Improper motives
prevent prayer being answered according to James 4:3. Also
the sovereignty of God, determines if our prayers are answered
(Romans 9:15). 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 225 -226
There are different types of prayers: thanksgiving, petition/
supplication and intercession. A prayer of thanksgiving offers
gratitude to God for His blessings. A prayer of petition or
supplication is a request for a specific need. Intercession is
praying on someone else’s behalf. 
In the Bible, both Hannah and King Hezekiah offered prayers to
God that were answered. Hannah petitioned God for a child
and God gave her Samuel. When King Hezekiah was sick, God
sent the Prophet Isaiah to inform him of his impending death.
After he prayed, God added 15 years to his life. 
There are many ways individuals can develop fluency in prayer.
We can use God’s Word and pray the scriptures concerning His
promises. Many people use words from the Psalms when they
pray. Making a prayer list helps you when pray. Praying
constantly leads to greater fluency.  
15


Christian Ceremonies
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Biblical verses related to love are usually read at
weddings. Two examples are: 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
and Romans 12:10. Genesis 2:18 states that “it is
not good for man to be alone.” Bible readings used
at funerals “bring comfort and hope for Christians
mourning the death of a loved one.” Two examples
are Matthew 5:4 and Revelation 21:4. 
Weddings and funerals are special ceremonies performed
in churches. A Christian wedding is a ceremony that unites
a man and a woman. Weddings celebrate new beginnings
and serve as the foundation for building families. Funerals
celebrate the end of human life. Christian funeral services
serve to offer comfort and support to the bereaved. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 227 - 228
Literary writings connected with weddings and funerals
assist people in getting a clearer understanding of the
ceremonies. They are written in the form of poetry, short
stories and songs. They also deal with the cultural
aspects of these ceremonies such as food, clothing,
rings, cake, music, and dance. An example of a poem
related to funerals is “Bulla Claudy’s Funeral” by Susan
J. Wallace. An example of a wedding poem is “May All
Good Things Be Yours” by Joanna Fuchs. An example of
a song/hymn for weddings is “O Perfect Love.” 
16


Caretakers of the Earth 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
As concerned citizens, we can persuade others to care for the
Earth in the following ways:
Be good examples by keeping the environment clean 
Have clean up campaigns 
Design posters encouraging others to keep earth clean 
Join clubs that teach about stewardship. 
Pollution is a major problem all over the world. “Pollution is the
introduction of harmful materials into the environment.
Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash.” Human
beings can create pollutants by throwing garbage on the
Earth and through their work in factories. “Pollutants damage
the quality of air, water, and land.” They can bring destruction
to all living things. (National Geographic Society).
The world we live in is a beautiful place. It is also a fragile place because its
resources can be depleted or destroyed. Environmental stewardship deals with the
“protection of the natural environment through conservation and other practices.”
If human beings do not care for the environment in which they live, the Earth will
not be able to sustain itself for future generations. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 229 - 230
There are biblical and societal laws that protect the Earth. In order to protect the land,
God told the Israelites to plant crops for six years and then to allow the Earth to rest for a
year (Lev. 25:1-7). There are societal laws that prevent people from polluting the earth and
destroying natural resources like our mangroves and coral reefs. 
17


Helping /Serving Others 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
In the Bible, many people supported and assisted
each other. In 2 Samuel 9:3-10, we discover that
David helped Jonathan’s son, Mephibosheth, by
showing kindness to him. The Shunammite women
helped Elisha by making a room available for him
when he travelled. She was blessed with a son
because of her kindness (2 Kings 4:8 17).  
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 231 - 232
When people serve others they gain a sense of purpose and fulfilment. Helping
others can make you feel “rewarded, fulfilled and empowered.” “Helping others,
especially those who are less fortunate than yourself, can help to put things into
perspective and make you feel more positive about your own circumstances.”
People build relationships when they help others (Ten Benefits of Helping
Others).
There are many persons in the world who
dedicate their lives to serving others. They
volunteer their time and talents to help those
who are sick or less fortunate. Some examples of
individuals are Bishop Lawrence Rolle and Pastor
Carlos Reid. Bishop Lawrence Rolle has a ministry
that helps to feed those in need of food. Pastor
Carlos Reid helps young people to turn their lives
around. He is in charge of the “Hope Center”
and is considered an agent of change.  
18


Taking Care of Me 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Moderation can be defined as the “avoidance of excess or
extremes.” It is the idea that individuals should commit to living
a balanced life. The Bible encourages individuals to do things
in moderation and not to be controlled by greed (1 Cor. 6:12)
and eating (Prov. 25:16). Being moderate helps us to live a
healthy lifestyle. 
There are many scriptures related to
one’s spiritual, mental, physical and
emotional health. Our bodies are
living sacrifices (Romans 12:1-2) and
our minds need to be transformed.
Our bodies are temples of the Holy
Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:20). Our spirit
is to be preserved from being
fearful so we can trust God’s power
(2 Timothy 1:7). We are to think on
virtuous things (Philippians 4:8). We
can delight in God because He
gives us the desires of our heart
(Psalm 37:4).
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 233 - 234
There are coping strategies for
caring for one’s total being.
According to the article: “Coping
and Emotional Well Being,” we
should engage in the following: eat
nutritious foods; avoid alcohol and
other drugs; engage in some kind of
physical activity; and take breaks
from social media so you would not
be overwhelmed by various
situations. Prayer is also another way
of coping with everyday concerns. 
It is important to take care of one’s total being so that an individual
can be healthy and whole. If an area of one’s life is not healthy then
other areas are affected. Caring for one’s total being boosts
spiritual, physical, mental and emotional health. It helps individuals
to manage stress and experience success in all areas of life. 
19


The Value of Work
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
In Genesis, we can see that God worked when He created the world. When
we work, we imitate Him. We honour Him when we work. Work teaches us
responsibility. It provides money, so we can have the essential things in
life and enjoy various activities. Daily routines, physical and mental well-
being, self-confidence and a sense of self worth are also built. 
In the Bible, there are proverbs and parables that deal with
work. The Parables of the Talents/ Pounds in Luke 19:11-27 and
The Shrewd Manager in Luke 16:1-12 show that work is
rewarded. Proverbs 14:23 states, “Work and you will earn a
living; if you sit around talking, you will be poor.”
All workers should possess certain
values. Individuals should be: 
Honest (Proverbs 10:4) 
Committed (Proverbs 16:3) 
Diligent (Proverbs 12:24) 
Dependable (Luke 16:10) 
Loyal (Colossian 3:22)
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 235 - 236
All individuals should contribute to society through work. Through work, individuals
can provide for their needs and increase their status in society. They help to
“increase the wealth of the nation.” They help to develop the nation through paying
taxes. People’s overall health and well-being are enhanced because they are
working to make a better society.
20


Be Fruitful  
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Over the years, people have changed their views concerning
having children. Many people are not having children or are
only having a few children. According to the New York Times,
“people want more leisure time and personal freedom.” “Not
having a partner yet, and not being able to afford child-care
costs” were some of the main reasons given by young adults
for not wanting children. 
In Genesis 1:28, God tells Adam and Eve to “be fruitful and increase in number,” to
have children or to procreate. In Genesis 9:1-7, the same command/blessing, “be
fruitful and multiply,” is repeated to Noah’s family. God desired humans to ‘fill’ the
earth so that they could rule over every living creature and keep it under control
(Gen. 1:28). 
Women in biblical days who were unable to reproduce,
faced many challenges. Elizabeth was an example of
someone who was barren. Because of her barrenness, an
angel appeared to her husband and told him that Elizabeth
would have a son (Luke 1:5-25). Another example was
Sarah who faced the same contempt from Hagar, her maid,
who had a child for her husband, Abraham (Genesis 21).

Families Are Special
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Traditions and values vary from culture to culture,
but many cultures share similar traditions and values.
Bahamians, Haitians and Japanese share strong
family values, and are friendly and hospitable to
others. They all show respect for their elders. In
contrast, traditions related to festivals, foods, music
and religious beliefs would be different. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 239 - 240
We can preserve family traditions and values in
the following ways: 
Build and keep your family history intact by
 creating a family tree. 
Bury a time capsule. 
Record audio, videos or podcasts. 
Create family history books, and newsletters 
Worship, pray, study your Bibles, and attend
 church together.
Families are the building blocks of society. Families help to
populate society. They help to pass down culture from several
generations. According to the article: “Strong families build
strong communities,” families take the primary responsibility for
education, spiritual development and the teaching of life skills. The
values of families are reflected in society.

Families Build Communities 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Healthy and unhealthy relationships are experienced within families. In healthy
relationships, individuals feel loved, safe and supported. They learn to solve
disagreements calmly. Family relationships can be considered unhealthy, when
there is lack of communication, mistrust, rivalry and even abuse. 
The Bible provides many examples of healthy and unhealthy
family relationships. The story of Esau and Jacob relates an
example of an unhealthy family relationship. In their family
favouritism, sibling rivalry and deception were quite evident.
On the other hand, Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha
had a healthy relationship. They lived together in Bethany and
were a close-knit family. 
Strong families help to build strong communities. Children who are
trained in strong families are more peaceful and behave well within
the larger society. They are able to communicate well and solve
problems when they interact with others. Because they are loved,
they are able to build relationships within the larger community.
According to the article. “How to Strengthen Family Bonds”, we can build strong
families and communities in many ways. Some are: 
Create a Mission Statement. 
Schedule Time together
Share Meals 
Do Chores Together 
Encourage Support 
Volunteer Together

A Community of Believers
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The church is made up of families that share their faith
from generation to generation. Families demonstrate
the love of Christ by sharing with others. They show the
peace of God by living in harmony with their neighbours
and friends. Families share the teachings of Christ with
others in the community and win them to Christ.
Christians live with the understanding that they are a community of
believers. Members of the church fellowship with each other (Heb. 10:25)
and share resources (1 John 3:17). They suffer and rejoice with each other
(1 Cor. 12:26). They demonstrate “brotherly love” in many ways
(Rom. 12:10). They are one body united in love (Eph. 4:3-6). 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 243 - 244
According to the article, “The Role of the Church,” Christian
churches help the community by: 
Being opened for quiet reflection; 
Operating programmes for young people and children; 
Providing counselling and advice for those in need; 
Providing food and clothing banks to assist those in need; 
Providing Christian volunteers to work at local charities.

Journey through Holy Week
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The main events of Holy Week have great significance. 
Palm Sunday – Jesus Christ rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, in
 fulfilment of Zechariah 9:9. 
Holy Monday – Jesus established respect for God’s house by
 chasing the money changers out of the temple. 
Holy Thursday - Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper or Holy
 Communion, instructing His disciples to remember his sacrifice
. Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane and w
as unlawfully tried by the religious leaders. 
Good Friday - Jesus died on the cross to save mankind and
 redeem us back to God. 
Holy Saturday – Jesus remained in the tomb awaiting His
 triumphant resurrection.
Jesus Christ’s suffering and death has had tremendous
effect on all human beings. Jesus carried our sins in His body
on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). Because of His death all who
believe in Him will have forgiveness of sins and eternal life
(John 3:16). Jesus received many stripes so that we could be
healed (Is. 53:5). When we reflect on Jesus’ suffering we feel
great remorse for our sins and our hearts are truly sorrowful. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 245 - 246
Christians must seek to honour Jesus Christ’s suffering and death, daily. According to
Luke 9:23-24, Jesus said that Christians must “take up their cross and follow Him.” We
honour Jesus by asking for forgiveness of our sins and living a life pleasing to Him. We
honour Him through our praise and worship, prayers, and giving offerings. We honour
Jesus by telling others about Jesus.

 Celebrating Easter
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The resurrection of Jesus Christ helps believers to live victoriously. We can give thanks
because Jesus gives us victory over sin and death (1 Cor. 15:57). The resurrection helps
believers to live with joy, hope and peace. We can live like Jesus who was the greatest
example for us. 
Jesus Christ’s resurrection is central to the Christian faith. It gives
hope to all believers that one day they will also rise from the dead
(Corinthians 15:21-24). It confirms that Jesus was indeed no
ordinary man. The resurrection indicates that Jesus is the powerful
Son of God who has conquered death and was raised to life for all
(Romans 1:4; 4:25) 
In The Bahamas, Christians attend many Easter services
which include Bible readings, worship, live drama and
preaching. Many Americans go to church on Easter
Sunday. Some communities hold special Easter services
with exciting traditions such as reciting poetry. Many
Haitians attend church on Easter Sunday. On Good
Friday, a big festive meal is served of fish, salads, boiled
root vegetables– but never red meat. 
We can celebrate Jesus Christ’s resurrection in the following ways: 
Dramatize the story of Jesus’ resurrection at a special service 
Witness to others 
Plant flowers to celebrate new life 
Count our blessings.

Obeying Laws and Rules
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 249 - 250
It is important to have respect for the laws of God and the laws of
society. Respecting God’s laws indicates an individual’s love, trust and
faith in God. Society needs laws in order to survive. Without laws there
will be chaos. Law-breaking sometimes leads to the violation of
people’s rights, such as the right to property or to life. Everyone must
show respect for laws.  
Many biblical teachings help to guide our
behaviour. The Ten Commandments are the
Christian's code of conduct (Exodus 20). In Romans
12:10-21, Paul gives Christians instructions on how to
live in love and peace. He said that individuals
should “overcome evil” by doing good deeds. 
There are positive or negative consequences for one’s
behaviour. Second Corinthians 5:10 says that everyone
will “receive for the things done in the body, according to
what he has done, whether good or bad.” Good
behaviour is rewarded with positive attention and praise
and tangible rewards. That is referred to as positive
consequences. Negative consequences seek to prevent
bad behaviour from occurring again, for example,
sending a child into timeout who was misbehaving.
27


Factors that Influence Behaviour
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
The Bible provides teachings that should guide our behaviour. Scriptures like Luke
6:31 and Eph. 4:32 teach us to be kind and respectful of others. Scriptures like Matt.
6:22 and Ps. 101:3 teach us to be careful what we watch as what we watch affects
how we think and act. Our speech should “always be with grace, as though
seasoned with salt, so we will know how to respond” (Col. 4:6). 
There are many factors that influence one’s behaviour. Some 
examples are social media, movies and music. According to the 
Oxford Dictionary, social media involves websites and applications to 
create and share content in social networking. It can have positive and negative
effects on children. Movies and music are enjoyed by many and can influence
the way we dress, behave and even the language we use.
The Bahamas is rich in traditions that have influenced our behaviour. Character
building is an important part of our training. We learn to have manners and respect
for others, from our elders. We are taught to be polite to strangers and be a good
neighbour. Going to church is vital because our nation is guided by Christian
principles. The Bible provides principles for daily living. Bahamians are great story
tellers. 
Stories which teach life lessons have been passed down from generation to
generation. Stories about Brer Bouki and Brer Rabbi are famous. Proverbs are
sayings that have been passed down from generation to generation; 
Examples are: “A boaster and liar are first cousins” and “Mad dogs bite the hand
that feed them” (H.H. Finlay – Eleuthera). 
We use proverbs to guide our actions.

Human Beings Have Rights 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
There are international laws and organizations that protects the rights of children
and adults. Some internationally human rights organizations are:  
Human Rights Watch  
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 
United Nations Foundation 
Some international laws that protect children and adults are:  
United Nations Conventions on the Rights of a Child  
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
The rights of all human beings should be promoted. We can promote the
importance of these rights by speaking up for what we care about, volunteering
or donating to a national organization, staying connected with social groups and
standing up against discrimination. 
The Bible contains several passages that relate to the rights of human beings.
Colossians 3:11 and Galatians 3:28 tell us that we should not discriminate. Proverbs
14:31 gives warnings against oppressing the poor. Leviticus 19:10 states that we must
provide for the poor. Ephesians 4:28 encourages everyone to earn an honest living.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “all human beings are born
free and equal.” They are entitled to basic rights and freedoms such as speech,
movement, religion, peaceful assembly, free primary education and employment.
These rights should be defended by all nations around the world. We should all
stand up against discrimination and support organizations that help others.

 Respect and Responsibility 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
It is important to show respect and responsibility for others. All
human beings were created by God and so their worth and value
should be respected (Gen. 2:7). The Ten Commandments
(Exodus 20) teach us to have respect for people, their personal
property and space. Moreover, it is our responsibility to look
out for each other and respond in the right manner to all
human beings (1 John 3:17). 
The Bible contains several stories related to prejudice and
discrimination. In the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus,
the rich man did not show respect for Lazarus, a poor
beggar. The Story of Esther also speaks of discrimination.
Haman wanted to kill the Jewish people because of hate.
His plan failed because Mordecai and the Jews fasted and
prayed. Esther went to the King and saved the Jews.
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 255- 256
It is through guidance and modelling that we learn respect and responsibility.
Some guidelines to display respect and responsibility for others include the
following:  
Treat people with courtesy, politeness, and kindness.  
Express opinions and ideas. 
Listen to what others have to say before expressing your viewpoint.  
Never interrupt another person.

Celebrating Pentecost/Whitsun  
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
GRADE 6
The Holy Spirit fulfilled the promise Jesus gave at the ascension to
send a Comforter. The Holy Spirit was no respecter of persons as it
fell on all who were in the room. The Holy Spirit came to live inside
the believers and empower them. The disciples spoke in other
languages in order to witness effectively to Jews gathered from
many different places. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 257- 258
Pentecost is another name for the Festival of Weeks, a feast on the Jewish calendar. It
celebrated the giving of the Ten Commandments to the Israelites fifty days after 
they left Egypt. It was also called the feast of Harvest, a time when the 
Jews presented offerings of their spring crops. It was celebrated fifty days 
after the Passover. Pentecost is also referred to as Whitsun. 
Pentecost is important to the Christian church. It commemorates the descent of the
Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in
Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Pentecost. It also celebrates the birth of the
Christian Church. The Church was established with one hundred twenty believers.
After Peter preached, over three thousand persons were added to the Church. At
Pentecost, the Church was empowered to preach the message of the Gospel. 
The Holy Spirit impacts people’s lives every day. The Holy Spirit works in us
by replacing our sinful characteristics with the Fruit of the Spirit (Gal.
6:22). His work makes us more and more like Jesus. Acts 1:8 states that the
Holy Spirit empowers Christians to be effective witnesses for Jesus Christ.
He teaches believers and guides our decisions (John 14:26). He helps us
when we do not know what to pray for (Rom. 8:26).

Christian Celebrations and Culture 
GRADE 6
PRIMARY RELIGIOUS STUDIES
According to the article, “The Importance of Culture,” culture is “the lifeblood of a
vibrant society, expressed in the many ways we tell our stories, celebrate,
remember the past, entertain ourselves, and imagine the future.” It is handed
down from generation to generation. Across time, various groups developed their
own cultures, or sets of beliefs, and 
behaviours. People of the same culture, 
societies, or communities had a sense of 
belonging together. 
Christian celebrations have impacted our culture in many ways. They have
impacted our behaviour and traditions. Traditions such as going to church
services, eating special foods, enjoying seasonal music, decorating our homes and
participating in parades are all enjoyed. Christian celebrations have helped
Bahamians to be more peaceful, joyous, generous and respectful of their fellow
neighbours and visitors to our country. 
Easter and Christmas are the main festivals of the Christian Year. Pentecostal
churches participate in special services, programmes or dramas about Christmas
and Easter. Songs and scriptures of the seasons are used. Adventist churches
celebrate Christmas with special services which include traditional hymns, scripture
reading, testimonials, and a sermon. For Easter, churches have special services,
communion and musical programmes. Methodist churches celebrate Christmas by
having special services like a cantata. During Easter, they may give up eating meat,
abstaining from pleasures such as coffee, sweets, sugar, and soft drinks. 
Reference: Bahamas Primary Religious Studies Curriculum (2023- 2028)  Pages: 259- 261
Christian festivals bring many benefits to Bahamian communities. They help
Bahamians to remember important beliefs of Christianity. They bring faith
communities together to celebrate these shared beliefs and values. The economy is
strengthened when visitors come to our country to participate in these festivals.
Bahamians also spend money in their local communities and help the economy. The
festivals create belonging and unity. Social growth takes place as relationships 
are strengthened and community pride is fostered.
