Foreword 
 
Secondary career-technical programs in the Bahamas are faced with many challenges resulting 
from sweeping educational reforms at the national level. Schools and teachers are increasingly 
being held accountable for providing true learning activities to every student in the classroom. 
This accountability is measured through increased requirements for mastery and attainment of 
competency as documented through both formative and summative assessments. 
 
 
Each secondary career-technical course consists of a series of instructional units which focus on 
a common theme. All units have been written using a common format which includes the 
following components: 
 
 
 Unit Number and Title 
 Suggested Time on Task  - An estimated number of clock hours of instruction that should 
be required to teach the competencies and objectives of the unit. 
 
 Competencies and Suggested Objectives 
 
a) A competency represents a general concept or performance that students are 
expected to master as a requirement for satisfactorily completing a unit. Students 
will be expected to receive instruction on all competencies. 
b) The suggested objectives represent the enabling and supporting knowledge and 
performances that indicate mastery of the competency at the course level. 
  
 Suggested Assessment Strategies  - This section indicates strategies that can used to 
measure student mastery. Examples of suggested strategies could include rubics, class 
participation, reflection, and journaling. Again teachers should feel free to modify or 
enhance these suggested strategies based on local needs and resources. 
 
Workplace Skills, Technology Standards and Occupational Standards - This section 
identifies the general workplace skills for all 21st Century workers. As identified by 
https://www.floridacareercollege.edu/.../skills-employees-need-to-succeed-in-the-
workplace.com. &  https://myjobsearch.com/careers/hair-stylist.html 
 References - A list of suggested references is provided for each unit. The list includes 
some of the primary instructional resources that may be used to teach the competencies 
and suggested objectives. Again, these resources are suggested and the list may be 
modified or enhanced based on needs and abilities of students and available resources.

RATIONALE 
Throughout history, people have practiced various forms of body care, grooming and 
enhancement for personal, social, cultural, and religious reasons. Some practitioners have 
applied their abilities in the workplace by providing professional cosmetology services to clients. 
The personal and professional care, grooming and enhancement of the human body is by the 
array of industries including those that manufacture cosmetics and related equipment, tools, 
and supplies for personal and/or professional use, and those that provide professional 
cosmetology services. 
Cosmetology, a strand in Career and Technology Studies, focuses on personal and professional 
grooming, body care and enhancement practices providing students with the opportunities to 
explore and prepare for cosmetology related career options. Cosmetology programs in the 
Bahamas, encourages the student centered process approach, which combines the development 
of thinking processes and practiced skills in concrete, realistic learning situations. Throughout 
the course students are encouraged to solve problems, make decisions and develop the abilities 
and flexibility needed to adapt quickly to new situations. 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION – COSMETOLOGY 
Cosmetology involves the science of improving beauty through the care and treatment of skin, 
hair, and nails. Students in the Cosmetology Program learn all aspects of hair, nail, and skin care. 
In addition to technical skills, students learn hands-on by participating in clinical experiences. 
During clinical, students practice their skills in our on-site beauty salon where they schedule 
appointments with clients, sanitize equipment, perform services and keep accurate records. 
Students are required to receive 175 hours of theory (a minimum of 2-3 hours per week 
throughout the entire period of instruction, conducted by the instructor), 300 hours of 
supervised skill preparation and clinic, and 25 hours assigned at the instructors discretion as 
needs of individual students dictate.

5. BACTERIOLOGY/SANITATION & STERILIZATION :  
Bacteriology, sterilization, and sanitation are subjects of practical importance to you as a 
cosmetologist, because they have a direct bearing on your well-being as well as on your 
client’s welfare. 
Types and classifications of bacteria: (cocci, bacilli, spirilla, staphylococci, streptococci 
and diplococci).  
Bacterial growth and reproduction: (active or vegetative state, inactive or spore-forming 
stage).  
Bacterial infections: (local and general, HIV & AIDS). Immunity (natural, acquired, and 
artificial) 
Infection Control: (Contamination/decontamination, sterilization, disinfection). 
 
6. DRAPING: 
      The comfort and protection of the client must always be considered during 
      cosmetology services. Protection of the skin and clothing assures clients 
      that the cosmetologist is personally and professionally concerned about their 
      comfort and safety. 
      Preparation procedures for draping clients includes; (wet hair services, chemical  
      services and dry hair services. 
      
 7. SHAMPOOING, RINSING AND CONDITIONING: 
Cleanliness is the key to attractive hair, proper analysis of hair and scalp is essential. 
            Shampooing is the stylist opportunity to put the client at ease and prepare her for the 
            service she is about to receive. And if the experience is pleasurable, the client is more 
            likely to enjoy the rest of the service as well. 
 
8. SAFETY IN THE SALON: 
Learn to use products correctly and safely. Study the manufacturer’s educational 
literature and read warning labels. Always handle, mix and store products following 
directions of the experts. The experts include the manufacturer and federal and state 
agencies.

9. WETHAIRSTYLING & DRY HAIRSTYLING: 
Hairstyling is creating wearable art. While roller sets, pin curls, and comb-outs may 
remind you of your grandmother’s visit to the salon, be assured that these styling 
techniques are very much a part of hairstyling today. In fact, the stylist who is skilled and 
versatile in wet styling techniques as well as other cutting and styling services will always 
be in great demand. 
 
10 PROPERTIES OF THE HAIR AND SCALP: 
All successful hairstyling services should be grounded in a thorough understanding of the 
growth, structure, and composition of the hair. Hair, like people comes in a variety of 
colors, shapes, and sizes. As a cosmetologist, you will need to know as much as you can 
about hair and how to keep it healthy. 
 
 
11. THERMAL CURLING: 
 
 Thermal waving and curling is the art of waving and curling straight or pressed hair 
 With thermal irons, either electrically heated or stove-heated, using special 
  manipulative techniques.  
        
       12. THE NAIL AND DISORDERS: 
              The nail is the horny protective plate located at the end of the finger or toe. It is an  
              appendage/attachment of the skin and is, therefore, part of the integumentary system. 
              The nails protect the tips of the fingers and toes and reflect the general health of the body. 
        
13. MANICURING AND PEDICURING: 
 
Manicuring, once considered a luxury for few, is now a service to many. The word, 
“Manicure”, is derived from the Latin manus (hand) and cura (care), which means the care  
of the hands and nails. The purpose of the manicure is to improve the appearance of the 
hand and nails.

14. CHEMICAL HAIR RELAXING: 
 Chemical hair relaxing is the process of permanently rearranging the basic structure of 
 overly curly hair into straight form. When done professionally, it leaves the hair straight 
 and in satisfactory condition, to be set into almost any style. 
 
15. PERMANENT WAVING: 
             Permanent waving is a two-step process. The first part of any perm is the physical change 
             caused by wrapping the hair on the perm rods. The second part involves the chemical 
             changes caused by the permanent waving solution and the neutralizer. The ability to 
       create a beautiful perm style will bring you professional satisfaction and help build a 
       loyal following of satisfied clients. 
 
 16. HAIR CUTTING: 
Great haircuts, or shapes, come about when you have a solid understanding of the 
important  
steps of the haircutting process. The process begins with combing the hair. Next, the hair 
needs to be parted, in order to create the uniform  work areas on which you will be 
working. 
It may be necessary to elevate, or raise, the hair while cutting to create a graduated 
effect or layers. The core of the process however has to do with understanding the 
physics of hair. 
 
17. HAIR COLORING: 
             Hair coloring  is both the science and an art. A skilled haircolorist needs to become 
             an expert in the following processes: (depositing color on natural hair, depositing color  
             on previously colored hair, depositing on hair that has been lightened, lightening 
             and depositing color in one step). It is artistic, adventurous, and in great demand.

      18. HISTOLOGY OF THE SKIN: 
 The skin is the largest and one of the most important organs of the body, and weighs 
only six pounds. Skin acts as a barrier to keep out harmful bacteria, fungi, and viruses.  
 Skin has three main layers, the epidermis (outermost layer), dermis (middle layer), 
 and the subcutaneous tissue (the deepest layer). 
 
19. FACIALS: 
 The cosmetologist does not treat skin diseases. However, the cosmetologist 
 must be able to recognize the various skin ailments and  know when to 
 advise the client to see a physician for treatment. 
 Facials treatment fall undertow categories: Preservative (maintaining 
 the health of the facial skin by using correct cleansing methods, increasing 
 circulation, relaxing the nerves, activating the skin glands and metabolism 
 through massage.  Corrective (correcting some facial skin conditions, such 
 as dryness, oiliness, blackheads, aging lines, and minor conditions of acne). 
 
20. FACIAL MAKEUP: 
 For most clients, makeup application should be subtle. The main objective 
 is to emphasize the client’s most attractive facial features while  minimizing  
 those features that are less attractive. When applying makeup, you must take 
 into consideration the structure of the face; the color of the eyes. Skin, and  
 hair; how the client wants to look; and the results you can realistically achieve. 
 Application will vary from client to client, based on your analysis of each 
 Client’s face and her individual needs. 
 21.  THE SALON BUSINESS: 
 
Starting your own business is an enormous responsibility and is not a step to be taken 
lightly. 
Much serious planning is necessary. You will need a thorough knowledge of business   
principles bookkeeping, business laws, salesmanship, and psychology before you can 
take on the role of salon owner and/or manager.
