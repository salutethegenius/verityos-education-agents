ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
As we seek to prepare globally competitive and productive citizens, such preparation must 
be guided by a consistent, relevant and critically challenging content. It was with this 
mandate that the initial design of documents in the Business Studies area were completed 
under the leadership of Ms. Faye Bascom, the Education Officer responsible for Business 
Studies at that time. Revision efforts commenced several years ago under the guidance of 
Mrs. Keyshan Bastian who preceded Ms. Bascom and would not have been possible without 
the commitment and collaborative efforts of many individuals and organizations. 
Appreciation is extended to the Teachers, and Subject Coordinators of the Business Studies 
Section, Department of Education and Private School Partners, the Curriculum and 
Examination & Assessment Officers within the Department of Education, representatives 
from the School of Business at The University of The Bahamas and The Bahamas Chamber 
of Commerce and Employers’ Confederation, respectively. Additionally, sincerest gratitude 
is extended to all other stakeholders that may have in some way contributed to the 
completion of this document, in an effort to ensure that students are competent, confident 
and ready to embrace life after their high school experience. 
 
OVERVIEW OF THE SUBJECT 
 
Economics in its simplest form refers to how man interacts with and in his environment and 
the elements therein contained. It is simply the effort to make sense of the economic truths 
which surround our existence, by identifying and classifying facts and using models and 
theories which explain economic events. 
There are several economic perspectives which span the capitalist economists, who are 
interested in the prosperity of a nation, the neoclassicalists who seek to apply mathematical 
principles to economic principles, the Keynesians who assess how the changes in the 
quantity of money in the economy directly reflect the rate of inflation and ultimately, the 
economic stability of a nation. 
This course of study will expose students to fundamental economic concepts and principles, 
which should adequately prepare them for tertiary studies or entry level employment 
opportunities.

SUGGESTED PROGRAMME RESOURCES / PROJECTS 
 
PROJECTS 
Design A New Business – Students will be expected to create a product which they will 
market to students in their schools. They will be expected to create a business plan 
encompassing topics covered throughout their course of study in the Business programme 
and launch an advertising campaign to promote the sale of this product. 
 
In The Know – Fundamental to students in an Economics class is being cognizant of current 
events, with the ability to analyze and evaluate the impact of such on the economy. 
Students will be expected to create a multimedia presentation using a variety of media 
types, surrounding five economic based current news items and demonstrate an 
understanding of the interrelationship of those events to the content being covered in the 
classroom. 
 
Educare – Students will be expected, using their collective business studies training, to 
create a website that highlights local scholarships available and launch a public awareness 
campaign to encourage use of the site. The site should include a visitors’ page and counter 
to keep track of the visits to the page and feedback to assess the impact of the site on 
public awareness. 
 
Mock Trading Activity – The stock market is a vital element in the current economic 
landscape of the world. As such, early exposure more adequately prepares students for life 
after high school. There are numerous brokerage firms that give students the opportunity 


Economics

to open and operate simulated mock accounts online. Students will be expected to create a 
portfolio and over a set time period analyze its activities and present analysis either hard 
copy or via a multi presentation.

INDUSTRY PARTNERS RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The general feedback on the document reflects an appreciation for the coverage of 
fundamental economic concepts, with the flexibility to include, identify and assess current 
issues. 
 
Recommendation: It was suggested that the content in this area be aligned with concepts 
and events in History/Civics/Social Studies and Mathematics, to ensure the transfer of 
knowledge. 
Response: Efforts to promote cross-curricular integration continues, as we seek to ensure, 
in partnership with core areas, that the learning experience for our students is relevant. 
 
Recommendation: Additional alignment was suggested between internal and external 
stakeholders including The University of The Bahamas, Assessment & Evaluation Division, 
Ministry of Education, etc., potential employers to ensure that content is relevant to labour 
needs. 
Response: Such efforts are ongoing and all parties mentioned were represented in the 
revision exercise to ensure reliability, relevance and relatability of content.
