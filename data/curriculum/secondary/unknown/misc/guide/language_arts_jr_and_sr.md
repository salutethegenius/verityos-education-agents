RATIONALE 
LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM 2010 
INTRODUCTION 
The Bahamian Language Arts Curriculum first designed in 1975, was revised in 1982. In 1999, the English Language curriculum for grades 7-9 
was revised.  The curriculum sought to improve students' proficiency in Standard English through the integration of Grammar, Composition, and 
Comprehension in the Language Arts curriculum.  Specific problems identified included: 
1. The inability of pupils to speak and write Standard English accurately. 
2. An inadequate Language curriculum for primary and secondary schools. 
3. Low reading levels of pupils. 
4. Insufficient teaching supplies. 
5. Poor Library facilities. 
In 2010, the problems (1-5 above) are still a concern. In addition to addressing these, the 2010 Language Arts curriculum will give focus to:  
1. Integration of Literature and Language  
2. Inclusion of peripheral groups 
3. Inclusion of technology 
4. The teaching of grammar 
While the 2010 curriculum will retain the basic focus of comprehension, composition and grammar, it will reflect a wider scope to become more 
inclusive, integrated and technologically oriented. 
 
 


6 
 
Literature - Integration 
The 1982 document sought to increase the proficiency of students in Standard English through the integration of the Grammar, Composition and 
Comprehension strands of the Language Arts curriculum. It did not include a study of Literature as a strand.  Although complementing the 
Grammar, Writing and Comprehension strands, Literature was developed and produced as a separate curriculum document.  In 1998 the Literature 
curriculum for grades 7- 9 was revised 
 
However, the 2010 Language Arts curriculum seeks to integrate Literature into the teaching of Language across all grade levels. The study of 
Literature should complement the study of English Language, as Literature is the basis of much of the content of language study and represents the 
end product of the language skills students are trying to perfect.  While Literature should create in students a sense of wonder and help them 
develop an understanding of themselves and their culture and the cultures, lives and experiences of others, it should, especially, heighten their 
sensitivity to and appreciation for the beauty and effective use of language.  Integrating language and literature will help to do this. In analyzing 
forms and techniques used by experienced writers, and responding to written and spoken literature, students will have models on which to base the 
development of their own language skills.  
 
 
Technology - Inclusion 
During much of the 20th century, written and oral modes of communication were widely used in Bahamian schools.  Students were primarily 
required to listen, read, write, or orally respond to information in order to demonstrate their skills in English Language.   
However, the 21st century with its myriad methods of communication, its focus on the visual and the aural, and its dramatic increase in the use of 
technology in the home, in the workplace and in tertiary institutions, demands that educators tailor information and enhance teaching methods to be 
relevant in this age where students are exposed to various modes of communication.   
The revised curriculum seeks to increase the use of technology in the teaching and assessment of English Language. The Internet, Blogs, Twitter, 
chat-rooms, podcasts, G-chat, instant messaging and the telephone are a part of students’ digitized world. Using these media will therefore meet 
students at their point of interest and help them to reap the benefits of using technology responsibly and effectively. 
Through the multi-modal approach, the 2010 curriculum will:  
• provide literacy, encourage critical thinking, and help students communicate effectively in the 21st century; 


7 
 
• accommodate various ways students learn and therefore reach a wider cross-section of the student population; 
•  provide skills for those who are not science, arts or business oriented; 
• encourage teachers to use technology as a part of their methodology in the teaching of Language Arts, thus enhancing the teaching-learning 
process; 
• help to cultivate independent learners; 
• help to create critical thinkers as students will be encouraged to distinguish between positive and negative influences transmitted via the 
Internet, will be made aware of cyber-space protocol and will practise discretion in the use of the Internet. 
 
Peripheral Groups - Inclusion 
The Bahamian population has always reflected ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity.    
The 2010 Language Arts Curriculum seeks to provide scope to accommodate this diversity. There must be recognition of the need for the use of a 
Language Enrichment Programme (LEP) and an English as a Second Language programme (ESL)in the schools, and this recognition should be 
reflected in teaching methods, in the use of indigenous literature and in other classroom materials.  
At present, there is very little scope for the gifted student and only a few schools aside from the special education schools provide opportunities and 
scope for students with special needs. The 2010 curriculum must meet the needs of all groups   (including the physically challenged, the 
intellectually challenged, the mentally challenged, the socially challenged, the linguistically challenged, as well as the gifted and above average 
performers), and foster an environment where students from varying backgrounds can communicate clearly and effectively.  
The need to recognise ESL/LEP in schools here in The Bahamas is critical and will become increasingly more so as the country advances into the 
twenty-first century. As the government of The Bahamas strives to secure equal educational opportunities for all, it is mandatory that Language 
Arts teachers in schools with large numbers of students who face linguistic challenges, attempt to meet the needs of these students in viable ways. 
When individuals’ first language is not English, whether it be Bahamian Dialect, Haitian Creole or Jamaican patois, their teachers’ familiarity with 
ESL/LEP teaching and learning methodologies and strategies will do much to correct their linguistic weaknesses. 
 
The Revised Language Arts Curriculum does not propose to provide an ESL/LEP supplementary curriculum for teachers in whose classrooms can 
be found students whose first language is not English. Instead, the Revised Curriculum proposes to sensitize teachers to the need to implement 
different teaching methodologies with such students other than the ones used for non–ESL/LEP students.  It proposes to prepare them to design 
more effective instructional programmes for these often marginalized students. Therefore, some of the sample activities in the scope of work are 


8 
 
targeted for ESL/LEP students; in the appendices can be found documents outlining the special needs of these students, as well as sample lessons 
and references for resources.  
 
It is hoped that sensitizing educators to the special needs of ESL/LEP students will lead to the subsequent implementation of programmes and 
relevant teacher training, all culminating in:  
 
• improvement in methodology and classroom instruction; 
• sensitivity to the correlation between the lack of language facility and perceived learning disabilities; 
• indigenous print materials being produced and then stored at the Learning Resources Unit for the use of all schools with a need for ESL/LEP 
materials; 
• audio materials for listening exercises; 
• the foundation for an ESL/LEP curriculum; 
• detailed guidelines for individual schemes of work; 
• sensitivity to the difficulties of learning a second language; and 
• an appreciation of the culture of the student population. (Re: language transfer, etc.) 
 
Therefore, the 2010 curriculum seeks to provide opportunities for all students to maximize their proficiencies in Language Arts. It seeks to produce 
individuals who are functionally literate and are able to think logically, critically, and creatively so that they can participate fully in society. 
It is well known that the social background of students plays a major role in the ease with which they learn English as a second language. Students 
who in their early years acquire a Creole as their first language often struggle with mastering the rules of Standard English, especially if these 
standards are not modelled or reinforced in their homes. It is no secret that numerous students in the system of education in The Bahamas grapple 
with Bahamian dialectic and other Creole interference as they seek to communicate effectively in the English language.   
 
The systematic teaching of the grammar of Standard English is extremely necessary in our language arts classrooms if we are to see our students 
improve their communicative skills in this language. However, teachers are strongly advised to move away from teaching random exercises in 
grammar and mechanics. Instead, they are to diagnose their students’ strengths and weaknesses (which will vary from class to class and from year 
to year), and then create strategies to enhance the skills and erase the weaknesses.  Teachers should integrate grammar into their instructional 
programme, meaning that, as far as possible, the focus of a grammar lesson should be reinforced in speaking, listening and reading comprehension, 
writing and even literature lessons that are taught that same week or month.

The Appendices contain several sample lessons in grammar and mechanics; these lessons reflecting the integration of grammar.  Also included in 
the Appendices are further notes on the importance of teaching grammar, the findings of research, and useful strategies for teaching grammar and 
mechanics. 
 
 
Conclusion 
The 2010 Language Arts Curriculum will ensure opportunities for students to communicate in Standard English using the thinking, listening, 
speaking, reading, writing, viewing and presenting skills within the grammatical framework of the language. The following are therefore the 
improvements to be made in the curriculum:  
1.  Integration of Literature and Language  
2.  Inclusion of peripheral groups  
3.  Increase in the use of technology in the teaching and assessment of Language Arts 
4. A systematic and integrated approach to the teaching of grammar.

HOW TO USE THE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM 
 
The National High School Language Arts Curriculum is intended to serve as a framework used by all government-established and funded 
secondary high schools in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. Independent high schools are also encouraged to use the document, which seeks to 
ensure that educators take a balanced and consistent approach to teaching the Language Arts.  The National Curriculum sets out: 
• 
the communicative objectives to be taught  in Listening, Speaking, Representing, Viewing, Reading and Writing Skills and Grammar and 
Technical Accuracy/standard English usage 
• 
the knowledge, skills and understanding required as students learn how to communicate in the English language, and the order in which the 
content could be taught  
• 
standards or attainment targets, which define what students should know and be able to do upon completion of specific levels of 
instruction;teachers can use these to measure students’ progress and plan the next steps in their learning 
• 
suggested teaching and learning activities, assessment  methods and resources;in these sections, educators are given specific guidance in 
how to teach and assess students and what resources are best suited to enhancing the learning process 
 
It is hoped that the various components of the National Language Arts Curriculum, such as objectives, content, activities and their sequence, will be 
reflected in teacher - designed schemes of work and course outlines. However, within the framework of the National Curriculum, schools and 
teachers are encouraged to plan and organize teaching and learning in the way that best meets the needs of their students.  
 
It is important to emphasize that the National Language Arts Curriculum materials do not represent a prescribed course of study. Rather, they are 
designed to serve as guidelines for the development of school-specific Language Arts courses of study, in order to best serve school-specific needs. 
For example, the education needs of a grade eleven class of students in a school in a socially deprived area of New Providence can be expected to 
be quite different from those of a grade eleven class of students on a FamilyIsland or in an affluent and long-established independent 
school.Education needs even within each of the kinds of schools will vary considerably because of socioeconomic, cultural and other factors. 
 
The Language Arts curriculum, therefore, is geared toward preparing teachers to make reasonably adequate choices in designing their own schemes 
of work and course outlines based on their assessment of their students’ strengths and weaknesses. The document should help teachers to build 
educationally viable programmes that respect where each child is in terms of his/her communicative skills, and where each child could be.

13 
 
OVERARCHING GOAL  
 
Students willdevelop the ability to communicate in English using the Thinking, Listening, Speaking, Writing, Reading, 
Representing and Viewing skills, within the grammatical and technical framework of the English Language; to 
facilitateintellectual and emotional growth through understanding, appreciation and creation of Literature. 
 
 
SUB-GOALS 
 
 
Language is an essential element in an individual’s personal growth and development. Consequently, the goals of the Language Arts curriculum are 
to provide opportunities for students to: 
 
1. 
appreciate and enjoy the use of a wide range of language skills to form, clarify and communicate ideas, experiences and information 
accurately, appropriately and effectively when listening and speaking, doing so clearly and comprehensibly in the vocabulary and 
grammar of standard English, using conventional sounds, forms, pitch, intonation and modulation, and adapting their talk to different 
situations; 
 
2. 
communicate ideas, experiences and information clearly, creatively, thoughtfully and coherently when writing, being mindful of style, 
structure, form, purpose and reader, as well as accuracy of standard English vocabulary, grammar and mechanics;  
 
3. 
interpret, appreciate and respond critically and relevantly to what is read and experienced in everyday situations (vocational, social, 
recreational, educational), realizing that reading is not passive but is an interactive process involving the work itself, the reader and the 
context of the reading situation; 
 
4. 
develop their ability to understand basic and advanced levels of what is being communicated in literature 
 
5. 
enhance their ability to appreciate and respond to different forms of literature 
 


14 
 
6. 
develop their creative self-expression through writing and performance 
 
7. 
communicate their ideas clearly and effectively using standard English, demonstrating technical accuracy (grammatical structures, 
spelling, punctuation, word usage)while appreciating the place and value of Bahamian dialect and other creoles in appropriate social and 
cultural situations 
 
8. 
explore and expand their understandings and communicative skills by using visual and auditory formats to support their written and 
spoken messages; students should be stimulated to communicate and respond using a variety of electronic media 
 
9. 
interpret and evaluate audio – visual material and programs, in this way enhancing their skills in responding, and critically assessing 
what they see and hear

Exceptional  
Learners  
 
Accelerated learners are those who exhibit marked ability in English beyond age-related expectations. Schools have a responsibility 
to meet their special educational needs by providing greater challenges in lessons and opportunities to develop their gifts. Schools 
may also provide additional activities beyond the everyday timetable. 
 
 
InSpeaking and Listening, students are highly confident speakers in a range of contexts for a variety of audiences and purposes. 
They selectand use styles and levels of formality appropriately. They possess an impressive command of idiom, a wide, sophisticated 
vocabulary and they are able to initiate and lead informal and formal conversations or discussions. Their ability to listen attentively 
and respond with full understanding to complex speech is exceptional. They use Standard English confidentlyin a range of situations, 
adapting it as necessary and speaking clearly, fluently, consistently and comprehensibly. 
 
Students with learning difficulties are those who have severe or profound and multiple learning difficulties or those with moderate 
learning difficulties, who may be working at age-related expectations in a number of subjects but are performing well below 
expectations in others. Teachers are expected to modify the programmes of study to give all students with learning difficulties 
relevant and appropriately challenging work at each grade level.  
 
In Speaking and Listening, these students are able to express their likes, dislikes, feelings, emotions and preferences, participating 
in social routines and communicating in a wide range of situations. When speaking, they are able to initiate conversation, use a 


17 
 
widening range of vocabulary and communicate in an appropriate form depending on the purpose, for example, questioning, 
directing, requesting and sharing information. They understand the importance of varying tone and volume in different situations and 
using appropriate facial expressions. Regardless of their difficulties, they are able to listen attentively and discriminatorily, 
developing memory and concentration. They exhibit the ability to participate meaningfully in both one-to-one and group situations, 
formally and informally and using Standard English appropriately.

STANDARDS 
 
 
Sub-Goal 2: Communicate ideas, experiences and information clearly, creatively, thoughtfully and coherently when writing, being 
mindful of style, structure, form, purpose and reader, and accuracy of standard English vocabulary, grammar and 
mechanics 
 
 
Grade 7:  
Students use the writing process when composing structured compositions of a variety of modes (both narrative and non-narrative 
forms), purposes and for a variety of audiences. Their vocabulary is appropriate and sometimes interesting and their writing 
sometimes reflects an awareness of audience. Compositions are organised, coherent and developed sufficiently, with paragraphs 
being used. They use some of the features of Standard English grammar correctly and their spelling, especially of simple words, is 
usually correct. Basic punctuation is generally accurate. 
 
Grade 8: 
Students use the writing process when composing lively and reflective compositions, whether narrative, descriptive, expository, 
persuasive or argumentative. They are able to develop their ideas in appropriate and interesting ways. Their writings are well 
organised in detailed paragraphs and reflect a basic understanding of how purpose influences structure, content and style. Risks are 
sometimes taken in word choice and vocabulary is often used for effect. Sentences are sometimes grammatically complex and 
spelling is generally accurate. Students use many of the features of Standard English grammar correctly and their spelling of simple 
and more complex words is usually correct. Basic punctuation is generally accurate, and some of the more complex types are 
sometimes used correctly. 
 
Grade 9: 
Students use the writing process to produce compositions that are varied and sometimes quite interesting. They often develop their 
ideas in appropriate and engaging ways and these ideas are conveyed coherently in a range of modes (for example, narrative, 
descriptive, expository) for a variety of readers, using a more formal style where appropriate. Cohesive paragraphs are always used 
and the content is often well explained. A clear sense of audience is present. Vocabulary is often used adventurously, imaginatively 
and precisely. Sentences are often grammatically complex and spelling is usually accurate. Students use many of the features of 
Standard English grammar correctly and their spelling of words with complex regular patterns is usually correct. A range of 
punctuation, including commas, apostrophes and inverted commas, is often used accurately.  
 
Grade 10: 
Students use the writing process to produce compositions that often engage the reader’s interest. Their writing reflects an 
understanding of the need to adapt style and level of formality according to purpose and audience. They frequently develop their 
ideas in appropriate and interesting ways in detailed paragraphs and these ideas are conveyed coherently in a range of modes 


19 
 
(narrative, descriptive, expository, etc) for a variety of readers.  A strong sense of audience is present. Vocabulary is frequently used 
in an adventurous, imaginative and precise way. Students use a range of sentence structures and varied vocabulary for effect. 
Students use many of the features of Standard English grammar correctly and their spelling of irregular words and those with 
complex regular patterns is usually correct. A range of punctuation, including commas, apostrophes and inverted commas, is often 
used accurately, bringing clarity to meaning.   
 
Grade 11: 
Students use the writing process to produce compositions that frequently engage the reader’s interest. They are confident writers and 
their compositions, which are organized in appropriate and well developed paragraphs, reflect a clear understanding of the need to 
adapt style and level of formality according to purpose and audience. Characters, events and settings are developed in their narrative 
writing. Their non-narrative writing (descriptive, expository, persuasive,argumentative) is coherent and reflects a strong sense of 
audience.  Vocabulary is effective because word choice is precise, imaginative and indicative of risk taking. Students use many of 
the features of Standard English grammar correctly and their spelling of irregular words and those with complex regular patterns is 
usually correct. A range of punctuation, including commas, apostrophes and inverted commas, is usually used accurately, bringing 
clarity to meaning.   
 
Grade 12: 
Students use the writing process to produce compositions that are thoroughly engaging and creatively composed. There is evidence 
that deliberate steps are sometimes taken to create effect and to hold the reader’s interest. Students write confidently, their 
compositions being structured in well developed cohesive and coherent paragraphs which reflect a strong sense of audience. They 
clearly recognize the need to adapt style and level of formality according to purpose and audience. Their narrative writing exhibits 
control of characters, events and settings. In other modes, they describe, express and discuss complex material coherently and 
intelligently. Their use of vocabulary and grammar enables fine distinctions to be made or emphasis achieved. Spelling is usually 
correct across the range of complexity. A range of punctuation, including commas, apostrophes, inverted commas and semi-colons, 
is almost always used accurately, bringing clarity to meaning.   
 
 
 
Exceptional  
Learners 
 
Accelerated learners are those who exhibit marked ability in English beyond age-related expectations. Schools have a responsibility 
to meet their special educational needs by providing greater challenges in lessons and opportunities to develop their gifts. Schools 
may also provide additional activities beyond the everyday timetable. 
 
Such students confidently use the writing process to produce original compositions that are thoroughly engaging and creatively 
composed. They are skilled in composing a range of styles and are able to sustain the reader’s interest throughout the piece.  Their 


20 
 
compositions comprise cohesive and coherent, well developed paragraphs that are linked in appropriate ways. They are able to easily 
adapt style and level of formality according to purpose and audience. Their narrative writing exhibits control of characters, events 
and settings and the use of a wide variety of story-telling devices. In other modes, they describe, express and discuss complex 
material coherently and intelligently. Their use of vocabulary and grammar enables fine distinctions to be made or emphasis 
achieved and spelling is usually correct across the range of complexity. A range of punctuation, including commas, apostrophes and 
inverted commas, is almost always used accurately, bringing clarity to meaning.   
 
Students with learning difficulties are those who have severe or profound and multiple learning difficulties or those with moderate 
learning difficulties, who may be working at age-related expectations in a number of subjects but are performing well below 
expectations in others. Teachers are expected to modify the programmes of study to give all students with learning difficulties 
relevant and appropriately challenging work at each grade level.  
 
In Writing, students are able to communicate and record events, experiences, information, thoughts and feelings in an appropriate

audio materials. They not only demonstrate, at an exceptionally high level, their ability to comprehend the messages conveyed in 
these materials, but they are able to analyze, interpret and justify their findings.  
 
Students with learning difficulties are able to make a comparison between what is real and what is fantasy. They are able to 
comprehend, sequence events, make predictions, identify cause and effect relationships, making inferences, and interpreting the 
content of movies and other audio-visual electronic programs.

Preparation: Teacher thinks of several complex activities that can 
realistically be demonstrated in class, preferably with actual props. 
Teacher then lists all the steps that are required for each activity that 
he/she will demonstrate.  
In class 
1. Using actual props or visual aids (if props are unavailable), teacher 
demonstrates the first activity. He/She starts by introducing the activity 
(for example, I'm going to show and tell you how to assemble a desk lamp 
or I’m going to explain and demonstrate how to transfer a seedling from a 
small pot to a larger one). He/She indicates the necessary items and tells 
the students what they are called. (You'll need a ….) Teacher tells the 
students how many steps he/she will expect them to recall later.  
2. As teacher says each step in the activity, he/she asks the students to 
perform the activity or mime it.  
3. After teacher has directed the students through two or three action 
sequences, he/she distributes the sheet with headings of the activities and 
the number of steps. Students are expected to recall the steps.

After the class studies a map of their island, which can be displayed on 
the whiteboard or electronically, the teacher arranges students in pairs. 
One student role-plays a tourist on a specified street asking how to get to 
various locations on the island (it may be a popular tourist resort or site), 
and the other role-plays a resident giving directions in response to the 
request. 
After the class studies a simple map of the island, the teacher arranges 
students in pairs, each with a copy of the map.  One student gives oral 
directions to the other student to get to a location on the map. The second 
student in the pair listens carefully, and then  marks locations on his/her 
copy of the map according to the given directions

stand at the front of the class and give directions to get to ‘their’ locations 
from the starting point of the school without identifying this location for 
the rest of the class. Their peers must listen closely to the directions and 
determine which location will be their destination if they were to follow 
the directions.

Teacher arranges students in groups of three or four and gives each group 
a scenario with a main idea. E.g. Donald is upset because he has lost his 
part-time job and talks to a few friends about how the loss has affected his 
life; Sonia has a crush on Jim and describes for her friends five ways in 
which she tried to get him to notice her; Henry is about to turn 18 and 
talks to his parents about the advantages of buying a car for him. They 
present him with the disadvantages. The group has ten – fifteen minutes 
to discuss a way in which they will present an unscripted dramatization 
that conveys the main idea that they have been given. Each group makes 
its presentation, but without revealing the main idea to the other students. 
The class then identifies the main idea and supporting details of each skit.

ask other students to read the statement on their card and decide if it is a 
fact or an opinion. Students should spend 3-5 minutes on this activity. 
Afterwards, discuss each card as a whole class, asking students to respond 
to whether the statement is a fact or opinion. 
 
or 
Students differentiate between fact and opinion and infer meaning from a 
variety of texts. In pairs, they read an excerpt from the "I Have a Dream" 
speech by Martin Luther King Jr., and answer fact/opinion questions. The 
whole class then discusses. Working individually, the class then reads an 
excerpt from “Out Island Doctor”, by Evans Cottmann    (or any other 
culturally relevant passage) and identifies facts and opinions to be found.

Working in small groups, students then write and perform a commercial 
about something (an aloe product, a jitney company, toothpaste, some 
special Bahamian food, etc.), including at least 2 facts and 2 opinions. If 
possible, the teacher video-records their commercials. In a follow-up 
lesson, the teacher shows their commercials on the TV and has the 
students write down each fact and each opinion from their 
classmates’commercials. A discussion should ensue.

Guessing Game:  Teacher divides class into two groups. Teacher presents 
class with a number of scenarios/events (given in full sentence/s): a boy 
sitting on his front porch crying; a woman running from her house 
screaming; a report which shows that in high schools, teenage pregnancy 
has decreased.  Each group will try to come up with as many different 
conclusions as possible. They are asked to explain their conclusions. 
-Students listen to a recorded piece and try to do a description of the 
speaker based on his/her voice. They identify clues that led to their 
conclusions. Class discusses the ‘correctness’ of the inferences. 
Character Card: Teacher gives students a note card. This could simply 
be typing paper cut in two or four. Have students divide the card into 
three sections and label ‘Character’, ‘Action’, ‘What I have learnt’. 
Teacher selects a character from the literature text being studied or any 
other appropriate text and asks students to write the name in column 1. 
Teacher gives students a list of activities the character is engaged in and 
they list these in column 2.  In the third column, students will write what 
they think of the character based on the information they have in column

This activity allows for Internet research. Each student is given the 
assignment of researching the Christmas celebration of another country, 
and writes down facts and information he/she collects. Perhaps students 
can be told to work in pairs. In class, students share the results of their 
research, orally exploring how people around the world celebrate 
Christmas. Next, they compare and contrast those celebrations to 
Bahamian celebrations by using a Venn diagram. They also illustrate the 
Venn diagram with pictures representing the Christmas cultures of the two 
countries (The Bahamas and the other). Essays are written as a follow-up 
activity, with attention being paid to the use of appropriate transitional 
phrases and organizational structures.  
Or 
Students write an essay comparing and contrasting their school 
experiences. Through guided practice, they create an outline of their 
primary school experience and high school experience (or primary and

Armbrister. It may be an excerpt from a literature text for the term. 
(However, the students should not have read the selection yet.) Students 
listen to a reading of the story/passage (by teacher or a recording of the 
passage) and take notes about the sequence of events as they follow the 
reading. After listening to the story, a number of students are invited to 
the chalkboard/whiteboard or flipchart to write one story event. Stress that 
these are to be given randomly (i.e., not in sequential order). When all of 
the events have been provided, the teacher arranges students in pairs.  
These student-pairs work together to put the events in sequential order on 
an informal timeline.

Before the class, teacher prepares a PowerPoint presentation on a “How-
To” topic, such as “How to Wash a Car” or “How to Dye a Garment”, 
with lots of attractive graphics as well as text. A second copy of the 
presentation is made, only with the slides mixed up (out of sequence). 
Teacher then reads the how-to passage to the class, (with the students 
taking notes). Following the reading, the teacher shows the class the 
PowerPoint show with the slides out of order. (Use “slide sorter view” in 
Microsoft PowerPoint.) Students discuss how to rearrange the slides so 
that the correct sequence is given. As they direct, the teacher uses the 
mouse to drag the slides into the correct chronological order. The teacher 
can even print the slides as “handouts” so that the students can order them 
by numbering them correctly. This makes it easier for the teacher to check 
their work. Students can work in groups of two to complete this activity.

changes his/her tone (e.g. from angry to frightened, to confused, to 
depressed to annoyed to ecstatic. E.g. “There’s a frog in my bathtub.” 
Students identify the tone used each time. Teacher then gives the class a 
sentence (e.g. “The door is open”) and each student has the opportunity to 
say it in a different way. The others identify the tone being used. Students 
then complete a worksheet where they are to identify the tone being used 
by the teacher as she makes a number of comments – eight to ten of them.

- Students are placed in groups of three. Each group is asked to select 
three pieces from their literature text, each piece representing a different 
point of view… 1st, 2nd 3rd. At the higher level, students could be asked to 
assess the difference the point of view makes in conveying the 
information. 
 
- Rôle-playing: Teacher gives students an issue/topic and they are to 
present a brief discourse on the issue/topic from the point of view of one 
of the following: a preacher (in the pulpit), a politician (on the platform), 
a teacher, a mother, a student, a news anchor, a person who is not 
informed/well read, a lawyer, a doctor, etc. 
 
-Teacher brings some products to class: cigarette, milk carton, eggs, 
candies, etc. Students will choose one and design an advertisement (visual 
or written) from the perspective of the advertiser, or the health-conscious 
activist.

- Teacher brings to class a headline article from the Tribune and the 
Guardian (same article). Students discuss differences in the news report 
based on the point of view. ( They may look at wording of the headline, 
facts included/excluded, tone, etc) 
- Students are given an issue: abortion, Sunday shopping, gay marriage 
etc. They will write their opinion in a brief paragraph.  They will read the 
paragraph to the class who will try to determine point of view …religious, 
political, conservative, liberal, nationalist, etc. 
-Evaluating Web: This could be a class activity depending on number of 
computers available. Have students access a given issue/subject on two or 
three different sites (health and food issues would be a good one ... 
smoking, Panadol, pancake syrup, milk). Have them compare the point of 
view on each site and discuss how the point of view frames the discourse 
and determines outcomes. For example, a commercial site promoting the 
sale of milk would present a different point of view from a medical site. 
Lead students into making these kinds of observations by asking questions 
like: 1. What interest does the promoter have in the product? 
        2. What information is the organization providing on the product? 
        3.  Has the information been skewed? If so, why?

Teacher guides students in a discussion of bias. Teacher has class 
listen to a Bahamian radio commercial that uses bias (teacher may 
also create such a commercial and present it as a radio advertisement). 
Working in small groups of three or four, students create ‘radio’ 
commercials that employ bias. These commercials are presented to the 
class, and the other students critique them, analyzing them for bias. 
 
Possible questions to be asked during the discussion of each 
commercial (the teacher’s guidance is critical for this aspect of the 
lesson to be successful): 
• Who created/paid for the message/commercial? 
• For what purpose was it made? 
• Who is the ‘target audience’? 
• What techniques are used to attract the listeners’ attention & 
increase believability? 
• Who or what might be omitted from the commercial and why? 
• What do the creators of the commercial want the listeners to 
think or do? 
• Where might the listeners go to get more information so that 
the effect of the bias is decreased? 
 This list may be displayed on the whiteboard.

"Bias in the News" Following a discussion of bias, students listen to a 
television news report (the teacher would have ensured that the report 
lends itself to the focus of the lesson), listening for words and expressions 
that they think imply a positive or negative value judgement. They record 
these words. After identifying these words or phrases, students will 
improve their critical thinking skills by discussing how bias can make its 
way into seemingly 'accurate' news stories. Key question: Why do you 
think the words convey a value judgement? 
 
If an actual televised news report is hard to come by, the teacher can rôle- 
play a news reporter, and present a story to the class to be critiqued.

(This activity follows one in which students would have been introduced

Teacher displays a poster or chart or overhead of the definition of 
propaganda and the different types of propaganda devices:(the art of 
persuasion; types: Testimonial; Glittering Generalities; Transfer; Plain 
Folks; Bandwagon; Name Calling; Card Stacking; Either/Or Fallacy; 
Faulty Cause & Effect)   Teacher then distributes sentence strips with the 
names of all of the propaganda techniques to the students, who will be 
working in pairs (one technique per pair; some techniques will be 
duplicated).Students spend 15-20 minutes preparing a brief radio or 
television advertisement (no longer than 30 seconds to one minute) in 
which they use the propaganda technique (PowerPoint presentation can be 
incorporated). The other students identify the propaganda technique 
demonstrated and comment on its effectiveness (Even if some students 
present an advertisement on a technique not on the sentence strip given to 
them, the activity is still valid, as critical thinking will lead the other 
students to recognize and comment on the error).

This unit will take three teaching days. The first day involves teacher-led 
discussions identifying common propaganda techniques used in 
advertising and speeches. Teacher presents students with recorded 
excerpts from political speeches that exemplify each of the seven different 
types of propaganda; students identify the types.  During the second 
lesson, students will work in small groups and create a brief political 
speech (one minute) using at least four propaganda techniques. For lesson 
three, students will present their speeches to the class and have the class 
identify the propaganda techniques demonstrated.  Teacher concludes the 
activity by leading students to a declaration that deeper understanding of 
propaganda devices can assist us in making better political decisions, help 
us to differentiate between fact and opinion and aid us in persuading 
others.

research and find as many figures of speech and other stylistic devices in as 
many songs as they can. Teacher may assign specific figures/devices to 
individual groups. The groups will report to the class. They may bring the 
songs and play them for the class. Teacher could ask students to explain 
how the devices enhance the song. This exercise could also be done with 
short poems.

displayed on projector. Teacher asks individual students to demonstrate the 
tone suggested by the given word; they may use body language or a  
sentence. 
- Teacher puts students into groups and has them engage in a conversation   
about a class mate, a birthday party they attended, etc. 
- In pairs, students create a dialogue using a particular tone, e.g. critical, 
  humorous, harsh, derogatory, etc.  They dramatize the dialogue in an 
 attempt to convey the tone. Other students will observe and guess the tone.    
- Teacher divides the class into two groups. One group is engaged in a  
number of activities, e.g. playing cards, dominoes, reading, listening to  
  music. The other group will try to determine/ describe the mood.

 rest of the class will guess what the tone is. They will also tell why they 
 choose the particular tone. This activity can be repeated to identify “feeling 
 words”. 
-Teacher gives students a set of short sentences(on projector or chalk-board) 
  Students will identify tone and the words which create the tone. 
Teacher asks students to substitute key words in the sentences to change 
 the tone of the sentence. 
- Teacher gives the class a short stanza or prose piece or a song, eg “Dey 
Call Me Potcake” ( Phil Stubbs). Students will identify tone words, 
describe the tone/s, and show how the tone/s convey meaning and mood. 
- Students write a short prose or stanza using 3 different tones. They share  
the piece with the class, identifying one tone in the piece and noting the 
word/s which convey that tone. They will ask members of the class to 
identify other tones along with the key words that create that tone.

The teacher allows students to role-play in pairs.  One student can 
pretend to be a reporter, the other a member of the public or one 
student can pretend to be a celebrity being interviewed for a 
magazine.  The pair then switches roles.  The questions should be 
written in advance.  Examples of questions might be: 
 
• What advice would you give to young people about getting a 
good education? 
• What are the advantages and disadvantages of being famous? 
 
 
The teacher will provide feedback on the 
quality of the questions and the depth of 
the answers, suggesting improvements as 
necessary. 
10-12 The teacher sets up the classroom like a newsroom.  Students role-
play.  Some are news reporters; others are news-makers or celebrities.  
They then switch roles.  These can be done on different days.  The 
news reporters ask the newsmakers and celebrities questions to which 
they respond.  This activity can be recorded to be played back. This 
activity can also take the form of a call-in radio show.  One student 
can play the host; several students can be the guests.  The host asks 
questions and invites the other students who are the listening 
audience to ‘call in’ with questions of their own.

The teacher divides students into groups of 4 or 5. Each group has a ‘problem’ to 
solve, such as “What could be done to decrease obesity in young Bahamians?” or 
“What could be done to reduce the problem of physical fights involving students 
from one school vs another?”  The teacher then distributes a piece of chart paper 
to each group. The students divide the paper into sections equal to the number of 
students in the group. They leave a circle or square in the centre of the chart.  
Each group member proceeds to reflect upon then write silently about the group’s 
‘problem’ in his/her personal area of the chart paper. The teacher determines how 
much time will be spent on this activity and reminds the students to respect the 
space and silence of all group members. After the allotted period of time, the 
teacher asks students in each group to begin discussing their ideas and find the 
common elements or ideas. Students actively listen, request clarification, and 
come to consensus. Each group should have a ‘scribe’ who records common 
ideas in the centre of the chart paper. At the end of the activity, the teacher can 
have each group share its thinking with the class by making a report of its 
findings/solutions to the problem. An alternative is to post the charts in the 
classroom so that students can view them later.

two personally–owned vehicles.). Students contemplate reasons, and then 
individually use a t-chart to record support for both viewpoints by citing specific 
reasons. Following this, the teacher places students in pairs to share their written 
ideas and come to a conclusion about which viewpoint to support. The teacher 
then asks a representative from each pair to share the group’s conclusion with the 
class.  Follow up activity: students individually write an essay about their own 
position and the reasons for taking it.

Teacher places a passage that uses reported speech rather than dialogue on 
the overhead (or distributes copies of such a passage). Students read the 
story and collectively work at converting the reported speech to dialogue. 
As they provide the dialogue, which may be a mixture of Creole and 
standard English (the aim is for realistic portrayal of the characters’ 
speech), volunteers approach the chalkboard/whiteboard and write the 
dialogue correctly, guided by the teacher so that it is accurate in its use of 
punctuation marks and paragraphing. E.g., the passage may report: Timmy 
angrily accused John of breaking his Play Station. John vehemently 
denied it. Students may come up with sentences such as “I know is you 
who put your sticky hands on my Play Station and break it!” shouted 
Timmy. and “No! I een touch it! Why you always accusing me?” John 
replied heatedly. 
Teacher then distributes a handout with examples of reported speech. 
Students convert these to dialogue, using standard English or Creole.

probably spoken to students at some time in their lives (e.g. fast-food 
restaurant workers, doctors, nurses, dentists, seamstresses, tailors, 
coaches, siblings, neighbours, teachers, policemen, employers [for part-
time workers, such as packing boys], immigration officers, store clerks, 
guidance counselors), or brainstorms such a list onto the board. Each 
student chooses one of the people on the list and, using reported speech, 
repeats one thing that this person really said to him/her and his/her 
response. e.g. He asked me whether I wanted some fries with my burger. 
A volunteer from the class then changes this to dialogue. e.g. He asked, 
“Would you like some fries with your burger?”  “All right, give me a

Working in pairs or trios, students brainstorm how an object (brought in 
by classmates or teacher) can be the focal point of a story.  (e.g. a broken 
toy, a pair of barbells, a sweaty t-shirt, a picture of an insect, a love letter). 
Each student then produces a portion of the writing (a line, stanza or 
paragraph) based on ideas brainstormed.  Ideas are then shared and 
combined to make one creative piece.  
 
Have students consider a specific incident in a Literature work, or have 
them choose an incident in the work, to which they will add a character,

Teacher shows students a short clip from a movie in which realistic 
dialogue is used. He/She then provides students with a single-page 
worksheet on which a narrative based on the clip has been recorded, with 
spaces left for dialogue to be inserted. Working collectively, students 
provide direct speech to enhance the narrative (They will most likely 
provide an approximation of the dialogue they recall from the clip, and 
this is acceptable as long as it is realistic). The teacher then shows another 
clip and asks students to work individually at providing a written version 
of it, in which a balance of narrative and realistic direct speech is used.  
 
Follow-up lesson: students use realistic dialogue, whether in Creole or

therefore having dramatic impact. Students discuss which of the 
conversations is more realistic, and why. Teacher then provides students 
with a dull excerpt ( no longer than 60 – 100 words)  from a narrative 
essay in which only reported speech is used, and asks them to enliven it, 
converting it by using a mixture of narrative and realistic direct speech. 
This exercise is done collectively. Next, students write short pieces based 
on teacher-generated situations, using a balance of narrative and direct 
speech. e.g. a guidance counselor cautioning a student who has been 
found going through his/her classmates’ schoolbags; a customer scolding 
a security guard who has been following him/her around a store; a doctor 
telling a patient that he/she may have to have a limb amputated.

students select a writer. He/She ensures that the person students choose is 
famous enough to have sufficient information available on the Internet or 
is accessible for an interview to be conducted. Teacher can provide 
students with an information-gathering handout.)  
Teacher provides students with a model of a biography on a Bahamian 
writer (one who is not on the list or who has not been selected by the 
students). Students write the biography on their selected person, using the 
material gathered and the model biography as a guide. The activity will 
most likely have to be continued as a homework exercise. Students may 
add photographs if they like. When they have handed the biographies in, 
if possible, the teacher publishes them in an anthology to be displayed in

The teacher asks students to compose a journal entry, writing from the 
perspective of one of the characters in a short story, drama or poem being 
studied for Literature lessons. Students are to imagine that the character 
turns up on the doorstep of another character from another text. What 
happens? What do they say to each other? The teacher stresses that the 
entry must be written from a character’s point of view and may give a few 
sample sentences to establish that students understand the assignment. 
 
OR 
Teacher asks students to write a journal entry about a character in one of 
the Literature readings for the week. The teacher could ask a series of 
questions to stimulate students’ interest, such as: Which character can you 
most relate to? Why? Is the character as mature as you are? Is he/she 
immature? What would you do if you were in his or her situation? 
Teacher encourages students to answer the questions within their journal 
entry. This activity teaches students to reflect, and assists them in making 
sense of the events that are occurring in their everyday lives.  
 
Literature texts; sample 
sentences  
The journal entries 
should be written in 
thefirst person and 
should involve at least 
two important persons / 
characters from 
different texts.  The 
entries should reflect 
students’ understanding 
of the events in the 
texts from which the 
characters were taken. 
 
Have students drawn 
connections between 
their schoolwork and 
their life outside of 
school? Have they 
drawn personal 
connections to the work 
that they are doing?

10-12 
Teacher directs students to do the following: imagine you have a secret, 
one which you are afraid to tell anyone. Write a number of journal entries 
in which you reflect on why this secret needs to be confessed, who will be 
affected if you reveal the secret, and consider why you are afraid to share 
the secret. The journal entries are to be written as though they were 
produced over a period of several days or a week. In the entries, you can 
include your interactions with others andyour decision to tell. Your secret 
should be revealed in the final journal entry. All the journal entries need 
to work together as a whole. That is, they should sound like a single 
person wrote them, and there should be consistency from one entry to the 
next (for example, if you write that you are deadly afraid of your step-
mother in one journal entry, it would be inconsistent to write an entry 
three days later in which you talk about the fun time you spent with her in 
the mall).

what they find memorable about high school, the 
joys and stresses of being a teenager, etc) and write 
a magazine article for teens based on the interviews 
as well as their own experiences.  Students should 
aim to write a strong piece, backing any assertions 
with evidence from interviews and personal 
experience.  The article should also have a strong 
sense of audience. 
 
The articles should be assessed 
on the students’ ability to 
provide details and appropriate 
style, as well as their ability to 
convey a strong sense of 
audience.  In addition, the 
students should also be 
assessed on their command of

Objective 2.22  Write formal research papers, using basic features of the MLP or APA style of documentation 
Grade Suggested Activity 
Suggested Materials/Resources 
Assessment 
10-12 Students will select a topic that interests them, and  
with the help of the teacher, narrow the topic for 
research purposes. This would be ideal for cross-
curriculum instruction.  For example, students might 
do more in-depth research on the impact of the 
Europeans’ arrival on the indigenous people of the 
Bahamas, in conjunction with their History class, or 
argue that the Bahamas would be better/worse off if 
it joins the CSME in conjunction with their 
Economics class.  Students should be given a tour of 
the library and shown where to find relevant 
information.  Students should also be shown how to 
get information online.  They should be encouraged 
to use 3x5 index cards to write bibliographical 
information and summaries of and quotes from the 
information they need to use.  As students may find 
this topic quite intimidating, the teacher should go 
through this process in stages, and if possible in 
small groups.  This activity should be done over the 
course of several weeks or longer, especially at the 
beginning. 
Library, Internet access, MLA or 
APA style sheets 
The teacher can assess the 
students on each step of the 
assignment (narrowing topic, 
identifying thesis, finding 
sources etc, drafts, final essay) 
or can assess the students on 
the final essay based on the 
criteria for writing 
argumentative or expository 
essays (depending on which 
the student chooses) and the 
students’ accuracy in following 
the recommended

to gain information about a crisis in that person's life. The student then 
writes a narrative in the voice of the individual interviewed. In 
preparation, the students must come up with good interview questions. 
Teacher has students work individually or in small groups to design these 
questions – about 15 to 20. The questions should pay attention to plot, 
character and setting The interviews are held, and students then draft the 
essays in class, after having reviewed effective story-telling devices. They

Then and Now. Students bring in two pictures – one of themselves when 
they were very young and the other, a picture of themselves today. Guided 
by the teacher, they write lists of strong adjectives and figurative language 
that can be used in a description of each image. They also generate 
material on a handout under the headingsthen and now. This material will 
concern their odd and amusing sayings and mannerisms/ habits, beliefs, 
and positive and negative personality traits.  They will probably have to 
interview relatives for the information about themselves as a very young 
child. Next, students write, peer edit, and possibly word-process the essay

Teacher explains that the class will read an editorial to determine how the 
writers use facts to support their opinions. The students listen as the 
teacher reads a short editorial from a local newspaper on a controversial 
issue (or a teacher-generated editorial on a topic such as “Are Hair 
Extensions on School Campuses Distracting?” or “Should Junior and 
Senior Schools be Combined?”. As the teacher reads, the class identifies 
the issue/subject being discussed, the writer’s opinion, the facts he/she 
uses to support his or her opinion, and, if possible,  the sources of the 
facts. As the students provide this information, the teacher maps them on 
a chart/whiteboard which has the following headings: subject, the writer’s 
opinion, facts that support the opinion, sources  
Students then work individually or in groups, writing a paragraph in 
which they form an opinion on a given subject, such as “School Vacations 
Should Be Made Shorter”, “Junior Junkanoo Should be Discontinued”  or  
“ High School Boys and Girls Should Attend Separate Schools” and then 
use at least four – five facts to support that opinion. This writing piece is

For average students and high achievers: In preparation, students research 
the events surrounding a local controversy. E.g. the sale of BTC, the Bah 
Mar issue or dredging in Grand Bahama. In a brief written outline, 
students identify the principal players in the controversy and outline the 
arguments on both sides. They document all sources used in this research. 
In class, as a whole group they discuss the issue. Following this, they 
choose a side. Then, using persuasive language and arguments based on 
fact, each student writes an interview explaining their opinion about the 
controversy to someone. That is, they imagine they are being interviewed 
by a reporter and write the transcript of this interview, attempting to 
persuade their audience to see their point of view.

Teacher reminds students that an effect is "what happened" and a cause is 
"why it happened." An example is given, such as, Because unscrupulous 
or ignorant people filled in the wetlands and built homes there, the wild 
birds died.  Teacher informs students that some causes have several 
effects and some effects have several causes and reminds students to look 
for clue words that indicate causes and effects, such as if and because. The 
teacher then distributes and reads aloud to the class a news article or 
passage that lends itself to a discussion of cause and effect, perhaps one 
about an endangered species in The Bahamas, such as the iguana. 
Competent student readers can assist with the reading. The teacher starts a 
cause and effect chart with a column on the left in which to record causes, 
or reasons why things happen and a column on the right in which to 
record effects, or short descriptions of the things that happen. She/He 
pauses the reading from time to time to have students identify causes and 
effects. Students identify both things that might happen if something else 
happens and things that actually do happen. Teacher also prompts 
students to make inferences, or combine what they already know with 
information given in the text to figure out why something happens the 
way it does. Students then write paragraphs on the causes and effects in 
the reading piece, using the chart as a guide.

Teacher places students into groups and gives each group an index-card 
upon which an emotion is written, such as hate, grief, fear, envy, anxiety. 
Each group is to come up with a number of phrases – “hints” – that would 
describe a person who is feeling that specific emotion. For example, the 
group that has the emotion “grief” might list “contorted mouth” and “tear-
filled eyes” as two of the hints. Then the groups pair up and trade hints to 
see whether they can draw conclusions about how the person feels based 
on the given hints. Students can later segue into drawing conclusions 
about characters in literature texts they are reading.

Teacher describes the contents of someone’s bag, as well as what the bag 
looks like, and students make inferences about the person based on what 
is said about the bag and its contents.  For example, a small leather change 
purse filled with jump drives and a single tube of lip gloss; a plastic 
shopping bag filled with vegetable peelings, fruit skins and corn shucks; 
or a backpack containing several library books about pregnancy, a male 
student’s uniform and a pamphlet on parenthood. After students have 
been provided with several examples, they get into groups and come up 
with bags of their own. They record these, and then trade their 
descriptions with other groups and determine whether the same inferences 
are made. Next, the whole class discusses each “bag” and its contents, as 
well as the inferences made, evaluating whether any of these inferences 
were unlikely because of a lack of support. For example, it is improbable 
that a computer bag containing three sets of students’ exam papers, a 
whiteboard eraser, a bottle of fingernail polish, several red pens and a 
compact mirror belongs to a student.

The teacher shows students how to use inferences to understand 
unfamiliar vocabulary. For example, he/she writes several sentences on 
the whiteboard such as “I decided not to sebelliate again this spring. The 
last time I tried it, the slugs feasted on the leaves to their heart’s content 
and it was not warm enough outside for the move to be successful.” 
Students come up with a list of facts that they know about the nonsense 
word “sebelliate” from reading the sentences, such as the facts that it can 
be done in the spring and it involves something with leaves that slugs like 
to eat. Then students make inferences about the word “sebelliate”, such as 
the ideas that it probably requires the use of slug or pest repellents, warm 
weather and involves something being transferred from one place 
(indoors) to another (outdoors). Students next extend these inference 
activities to real-life applications by using the same process to infer the 
meanings of difficult words in sentences from a literature text, when the 
words can be understood from context.

of view is being presented. Students then watch a brief clip (no longer 
than 10 minutes) of a movie that has been reviewed in print. It may be a 
Bahamian movie. Next, they read a review of the movie and determine the 
writer’s point of view, analyzing his/her language. Teacher asks probing

support of his/her point of view. Students must be on the lookout for 
evidence of bias or weaknesses in the writer’s arguments when this point 
of view is being presented. Students then listen to a speech delivered by a 
local motivational speaker (no longer than 15 minutes; written copies of 
the speech must be available). e.g., David Burrows or Terez Davies, the

Teacher has students review how we determine what kind of person a 
character is (by his/her words and thoughts, actions, and by what others 
say about him/her). The class reads a fairly long passage that lends itself 
to character analysis and then the teacher leads students in the writing of a 
“character analysis recipe”. He/She writes the name of the character on 
the board; has the class brainstorm the personality/character traits of that 
person, with justification; writes those traits on the board as the students 
share their thoughts; gives students sample cooking terms, such as a cup 
of…, a dash of…, a pinch of…; a tablespoon of…; leads students  in 
composing a "character recipe" for that person, including as many 
cooking terms as possible as they write about the character's concrete and 
abstract qualities. For example, the character might be described as having  
• 
a cup of dishonesty,  
• 
a dash of sarcasm, and  
• 
a pinch of compassion.          
Next, students work individually or in pairs to create a character recipe for 
other characters in the passage. When students complete their recipes, 
they share them with their classmates. As an extended activity, they may

The teacher writes the terms “denotation” and “connotation” on the board 
and students review the meanings of the words (Denotation: the 
dictionary meaning of a word. The literal meaning of a word. 
Connotation:   The emotional or cultural meaning attached to a 
word.These may be positive or negative). Teacher models the difference 
with the class.   
Students give alternative words for the neutral word “overweight”. The 
class discusses whether each word has a negative or positive connotation, 
describing their mental pictures. Examples: fat, chubby, plump, obese, 
solid, big-boned. Another example: “dog”: potcake, hound, puppy, mutt, 
canine, flea-bag and man’s best friend. The teacher then distributes a 
graphic organiser that has three columns, headed: Positive, Negative and 
Neutral. Teacher also gives students a copy of a passage, perhaps an 
excerpt from a literature text, one that lends itself to the analysis of 
denotation and connotation. In pairs, students work at discussing the 
denotation and connotation of underlined words in the passage, and then 
organise the words in the appropriate column. If some of the words are 
unfamiliar to the pair, one student can look up the word in the dictionary 
while the other student records the answer.  A pair may disagree on where 
some words should be placed, as words may have different connotations 
to each student. The teacher lets them know that it is all right to disagree, 
but they must be able to support why they have categorized a word in a 
certain way.   The groups share their answers with the class. 
Disagreements on connotations may arise, and this should add to a lively 
discussion. Having students describe their mental pictures may enhance 
the discussion.

romantic song (for example “I Just Called to Say I Love You”).  Ask 
students to consider how each helps to create a loving and caring mood.  
Then ask students to write their own poems about love, using any of the 
different techniques they are familiar with to express their love for family, 
friend, country, or romantic interest. (The teacher may continue to play 
various “love songs” in the background as students work.)

Having completed the study of one of the dramas from the BGCSE 
syllabus, ask students to dramatize a recent event or an original story in a 
way that expresses their views about or attitude towards the event or 
theme. This should take the form of a skit or a scene from a larger work 
(which students may or may not be asked to create).   
Have students begin by outlining the major plot events and identifying 
characters who should be in the play.  Next, students should put together 
the dialogue, keeping it realistic and appropriate to each character.  
Finally, students add or refine stage directions, especially those which 
refer to characters’ actions, emotions and facial expression.  Neat final 
drafts of scripts should be typed and submitted to the teacher.  
Students may work individually, or may be asked to work in pairs or 
small groups.

Assessment 
7-9 
The teacher will explain that the perfect tense consists of past, 
present or future tense of the verb ‘to have’ (depending on the 
tense one wishes to use) plus the participle of the main verb.  
For example, has+given.  The purpose of the perfect tense is 
also discussed. The teacher then writes sentences about the 
characters and plot of a literature text being studied on the 
board and asks students to identify orally if the sentences are 
in the present, past or future perfect tense.  E.g., “After 
Charlotte had talked to Wilber, she spun a web which spelt 
out a word”. The lesson should then be reinforced with 
worksheets, with students composing their own sentences and 
identifying the perfect tense being used in given sentences. 
 
Chalkboard;literature text as 
stimulus; worksheet 
The teacher will give the students a 
quiz of about ten sentences in 
which they will be asked to identify 
and/ or construct sentences using 
the past, present and future perfect 
tenses. 
10-12 
The teacher divides the class into small groups (three or four 
to a group). Teacher then ‘auctions’ sentences, and the groups 
have the option of bidding on those sentences which they 
believe make use of the perfect tense: 
- 
The aim of the game is to purchase as many correct 
sentences as possible  
- 
Each group will have $5000 to spend  
- 
Bids begin at $200  
- 
Bids increase by $100 each bid  
- 
The sentence will be sold to the highest bidder ("$600

- 
The group which has bought the most correct 
sentences is declared the winner and gets a prize 
- 
The teacher can make the auction more difficult by 
declaring the winner based on the number of correct 
sentences minus the number of incorrect sentences. 
- 
Once the game is over, the students discuss each 
sentence, explaining why it is correct (in that it makes 
use of the perfect tense) or incorrect (doesn’t use the 
perfect tense).

Assessment 
7-9 
The teacher will explain that the progressive tense is created by 
using the past, present, or future of the verb ‘to be’ plus the ‘ing’ 
form of the main verb. For example, ‘are + dancing’.  The 
teacher will write sentences on the board and ask students to 
identify if the sentences are in the present, past or future 
progressive tense.  The lesson should be reinforced with 
worksheets.

The teacher will ask students to develop scenarios in which a 
character will perform a continuous action in the past, present 
and future.  This activity can begin as an oral exercise in which 
the teacher asks all students to add details to a story of a 
character doing something in the progressive tense. Students can 
then write their stories.  For example, ‘Virginia was laughing.’  
Students can then write the complete story.

In preparation, the students will research an entertainer, learning 
something about his/her family and pets, and their daily

information in no more than six sentences, using the correct 
agreement of subject and verb. E.g. Jada Pinkett-Smith walks 
the dogs early in the morning. The rest of the class critiques 
these sentences orally for correct s-v-a. The teacher then 
distributes worksheets to students and has them place the correct 
form of the verb in the blank spaces.

The teacher will ask students to listen to advertisements and 
music in which the subject verb agreement is incorrect e.g. ‘At 
Superwash they washes ya, presses ya, feeds ya and entertains 
ya 24/7’ and asks  students to write the advertisements or part of 
the song in standard English, using correct subject-verb 
agreement. Students can then work in groups to write 
advertisements in which they deliberately use incorrect subject-
verb agreement to create humor.  The groups then switch 
advertisements and write them in standard English.  The teacher 
can also use this to lead a class discussion on the use of standard 
English in formal and informal situations.

- Coordinating conjunctions: Give students the acronym F A N B O Y S. 
Have them list the name of the coordinating conjunction under each letter 
(for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so ).This exercise will help younger students 
remember the seven coordinating conjunctions.   
- Have students write seven sentences using each of these conjunctions. 
They may be instructed to write sentences in which they join words, 
phrases and clauses. Emphasize that there must be equality of the 
relationship between the ideas joined. 
 
- Silly Game. Have students write one long sentence using the seven 
coordinating conjunctions. They may be instructed to use them in a 
particular order, eg FANBOYS or in random order. 
- Subordinating conjunctions: Give students independent clauses on strips 
of paper and have them complete the clauses with a subordinating 
conjunction and a dependent clause. E.g. The car was not moving... 
(because the gas tank was empty). 
Give them phrases and have them add independent clauses. E.g.  
Although I trained very hard.... (I did not win the race).

sheet of paper with a prompt for a narrative. E.g. The old man was sitting 
by the lake and he had a fish in his hand.... The first student in the group 
will add an idea to advance the story but must use either a coordinating or 
subordinating conjunction. Teacher may choose to have each student 
conceal his/her sentence by folding the paper so the next student writes 
his/her sentence not knowing what the previous sentence is; only the 
prompt is revealed. This will generate a really humorous

-Have students identify the verb in a sentence. E.g. The agent sold the boy 
a cell phone.  Students will recognize this is a simple sentence because it 
has only one verb (finite). Students will do exercises with longer 
sentences so they understand that simple does not mean short. 
- Have students expand the simple sentence to form compound sentences. 
E.g. The agent sold the boy a cell phone and he was excited. Have 
students identify the elements which make this a compound sentence. 
(Two main clauses [two finite verbs] + conjunction). 
- Do several exercises in which students identify simple and compound 
sentences. 
- Have students identify simple and compound sentences from 
comprehension passages and literature text being studied. They will copy

The teacher elicits from students that parallel structure, or parallelism, 
means two or more items in a sentence have the same grammatical 
form because they have the same function.Parallel structure creates 
balance and makes one’s ideas clearer.  Teacher gives students a copy 
of a very brief portion of a speech that he/she has written, in which the 
sentences lack balance. It may begin in the following way:  
My fellow citizens, I know some of you are tired, angry and some are 
suffering from frustration. People have lied to you; people have been 
stealing from you and you have been misled by people.  Well, I am here 
to soothe your weary souls and I want to reassure you as well.  
Working together, the students orally re-compose the sentences so that 
they are balanced.  As they do so, the teacher writes the corrected 
sentences on the chalkboard. Next, students complete an assignment 
calling for them to re-write several other paragraphs of the speech so 
that parallel structure is clear.

literary work, one should use the present tense. He/She provides an example, 
using information from a literary text studied by the students: 
 
At this point Phyllis and Stafford decide to elope to the United States. Phyllis is 
a little uneasy about the decision but she goes along with Stafford’s wishes 
because she loves him. It is at this point that she and Stafford consummate their 
relationship. 
 
Teacher  cautions students not to slip into the past tense: 
At this point Phyllis and Stafford decide to elope to the United States. Phyllis 
was a little uneasy about the decision but she goes along with Stafford’s wishes 
because she loves him. It is at this point that she and Stafford consummated 
their relationship. 
 
Teacher informs students that it may be necessary to use the perfect tense when 
a chronological sequence of events is involved. E.g.  
Once Stafford has succeeded in seducing Phyllis, he disappears, although this 
is not immediately apparent.  
Students read a very short story and summarize the plot, using the present tense.

Teacher and students discuss how the double negative is very 
much a part of Bahamian Creole. They explore examples, such 
as, “He een give me none” and “She say she didn’t see nobody 
in the room when she been there”.   
Teacher reminds students that the double negative is to be 
avoided when standard English is spoken or written.  
Each student composes a declarative sentence in which the 
double negative is used and shares it orally with the whole class. 
The teacher questions the student, converting the sentence to an 
interrogative one which corrects the double negative. The 
student rephrases the declaration, echoing the correction of the 
double negative.  
E.g.  Student: I didn’t tell her nothing. 
        Teacher: You didn’t tell her anything? 
        Student: No, I didn’t tell her anything.

Working in small groups, the students compose brief skits,based 
on a variety of scenarios, in which they use the double negative 
in Bahamian Creole at least ten times. For example, a child 
‘fibbing’ to a parent about skipping school; a pickpocket lying 
to the police about the crime committed; a patient trying to 
convince a doctor that he/she has been sticking to a strict diet; a 
customer inquiring from a vendor whether she/ he has certain 
goods for sale etc. 
The groups share their skits out loud, and then produce a 
standard English version, to be graded by the teacher.

Teacher reminds students that a modifier is a word or phrase that 
gives more information about the subject, verb, or object in a 
sentence.He/She tells students that a word or phrase that 
modifies (or describes) a word that has been left out of the 
sentence or that has been written in the wrong place is called a 
dangling or misplaced modifier. Students examine and discuss 
several examples, identifying modifiers that are used correctly 
and incorrectly in sentences, and explaining why they are 
correct or incorrect.  
E.g. Dashing up the stairs, the school bell rang(incorrect); 
While I was dashing up the stairs, the school bell rang(correct); 
Stashed in the cupboard for a year, my mother decided to throw 
away the mouldy cereal(incorrect); The mouldy cereal had been 
stashed in the cupboard for a year, so my mother decided to 
throw it away(correct). 
 
Next, students rewrite a number of sentences, correcting the 
dangling modifiers. E.g. While eating lunch, a roach crawled out 
of her sandwich; Dangling in the sea, the fish nibbled at our toes 
etc.

selecting the verbs carefully (said, shouted, complained, 
whispered, etc.) and comment on why they used a particular 
verb instead of another. Teacher gives a comic strip to each

identify the contractions and discuss how they are used. The 
teacher next has the students brainstorm on paper what they 
would like to write/draw about in a comic. If they cannot decide, 
the teacher can provide them with a topic, such as someone, all 
dressed up, being caught in the rain on the way to school on fun- 
day and having to take shelter in an old building.  Teacher gives 
students the template for a comic strip, with 5 – 6 boxes.

APPENDIX   A 
WHY TEACH GRAMMAR/ THE CONVENTIONS OF STANDARD ENGLISH? 
 
 
Some educators refer to grammar and mechanics as conventions. Conventions represent the extent to which an individual uses grammar and 
mechanics with precision, whether speaking or writing.Educators have long acknowledged that multiple errors in grammar and mechanics result in 
decreased clarity of meaning and sometimes credibility. For this first reason, it is important that Language Arts teachers assist their students with 
the mastery of the conventions of Standard English.  
 
Additionally, English is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, ranking fourth in the list, and it is the most spoken official language 
in the world. Although it can be argued that more Bahamians speak Bahamian Creole/Dialect than Standard English, English is the official 
language of The Bahamas, and is used in our business sectors and our systems of education and justice. Equally important, English is the primary 
language used in international affairs and is inarguably the chief language of global trade and commerce. In many countries, including The 
Bahamas, where tourism is the main industry, tourism authorities and other officials must speak and write Standard English to communicate 
effectively with millions of persons interested in visiting the country. 
 
Moreover, having more than a rudimentary/basic working knowledge of the grammar of Standard English is important for those who seek to study 
abroad. In universities and colleges in Great Britain, the United States and Canada, which typically attract Bahamians as international students, 
English is the major language of instruction.  
 
Also, the twenty-first century has seen an increasingly interconnected and globalized world and the importance of learning Standard English cannot 
be overstatedin this world. Having very good communicative skills in English, that is, knowing and using the conventions effectively, can bring an 
individual numerous employment opportunities in international markets and regions. 
 
Conventions are undeniably important. However, teachers are urged to remember that students in classrooms where conventions are valued over 
everything else get a distorted view of English. Expect correctness from students, but do not emphasize the correctness of grammar and mechanics 
over the joy of experiencing and experimenting with the English language in listening, speaking, writing and reading exercises.     
Languages evolve. Teachers are reminded to stay current.

GRAMMAR & RESEARCH - RESEARCH REVEALS THAT: 
 
• 
the isolated teaching of traditional grammar, meaning the identification of parts of speech and the rules of usage, has little or noimpact on 
 
students’ abilities to write well (Hillocks, 1986); 
• grammar is best learnt when taught within the context of reading, writing, listening  and speaking ( Glover & Stay, 1995); 
• there are often patterns in student error and these patterns frequently reflect misconceptions and problems with logic;therefore, a teacher can 
study a student’s writing, identify the problems he/she has with grammar, and discuss how to improve the writing with that student 
(Shaughnessy, 1977); 
• when students see the logic or meaning behind grammar and mechanics, rather than the correctness, their ability to write effectively 
improves (Patterson, 2001); 
• learning punctuation in the context of writing is much more effective than studying punctuation marks and rules for punctuation in isolation 
(Calkins, 1986); 
• usage, sentence variety, sentence-level punctuation, and spelling are applied more effectively in  writing itself when studied and discussed in 
the context of writing, rather than through isolated skills instruction (DiStefano and Killion, 1984); 
• systematic practice in combining and expanding sentences can increase students' repertoire of syntactic structures and can also improve the 
quality of their sentences, when stylistic effects are discussed as well (Hillocks and Smith, 1991); 
• teachers who are aware of the rules that govern the dialects or creoles their students speak are better able to help students see that they have 
linguistic choices and alternatives and that “they must  use language that is appropriate to the situation and audience” (Smitherman, 1977). 
• for learners of English as a second language, extensive reading may promote the acquisition of grammatical structures better than explicitly 
studying or practicing such structures (Elley, 1976); 
• for both first and second language learners, extensive reading significantly promotes grammatical fluency and a command of the syntactic 
resources of the language (Krashen, 1993); 
• “it is not unusual for people acquiring a  skill  to get ‘worse’ before they get better and writers err more as they venture more” 
(Shaughnessy, 1977). 


303 
 
 
APPENDIX B 
STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING GRAMMAR & MECHANICS 
 
 
• Focus on usage. Limit the time spent on complex grammar explanations, with students memorizing cumbersome terms and then poring over 
and parsing copious examples. Instead, concentrate on helping students to use Standard English grammar and mechanics in the context of 
listening, speaking, writing and reading.  
 
• Model the conventions of Standard English. Most students already are expert dialect speakers. Unless the focus of the language is dialect, 
speak Standard English at all times. When students respond to questions in dialect, ask them in non-threatening ways to repeat what they 
have said in Standard English (many speakers of English as a second language see efforts to make them speak a standard version as a threat 
against an important part of their personal culture – their first language). An example of a non-threatening reminder is: “That’s good, but 
let’s practise our Standard English”. The teacher can also restate a Creole speaker’s sentence/s in Standard English before proceeding with 
the lesson. Example: 
 
Student: He did say he een ga do it ‘cause he was scared a what his mother was ga’ say. 
 
Teacher: He said he wasn’t going to do it because he was afraid of what his mother would have to say. Yes. Can we all agree that that 
answer is right?  
 
 
• Target two or three specific types of errors, e.g. sentence structure, spelling and subject-verb agreement, instead of correcting all errors in 
the first draft of an essay. Ideally, the errors targeted should be those that have been taught or reinforced in recent lessons.  
 
• Use examples as teaching tools. Create examples on a particular theme or topic so that students have more contact with specific information 
and vocabulary. For example, use examples culled from literature texts. Create fragments, run-on sentences, errors in subject-verb 
agreement etcetera from the content of the texts, and have students correct these errors.  
• Give students numerous opportunities and encouragement to write for a variety of purposes and real audiences. Let them write letters to 
members of administration, community organizations, the editors of local newspapers, fan clubs, and so on. Local newspapers often 
encourage students to submit articles for supplements and periodic student pages. Make use of these opportunities. The teacher’s 
involvement should include assistance with sentence structure and the mechanics of writing, during both revision and editing.   


304 
 
• In an effective Language Arts writing classroom, students gather ideas, draft a writing piece, receive feedback on it, revise the draft, and 
then edit it before publishing the final draft. Editing involves getting the conventions –grammar and mechanics –of a writing piece right. 
Editing cleans up a writing piece, making it readable. Teach students to correct their spelling, put punctuation in the right places, ensure the 
grammar is correct, check for capitals, and so on. Be sure students understand that editing andrevising are different and create opportunities 
for them to edit their writing. 
 
• Teach the grammatical concepts that are critically needed for editing writing, and teach these concepts and terms mostly through mini- 
lessons and conferences, while helping students edit. 
 
• Students have different learning styles, so present grammar and mechanic points in oral and written ways.  For example, music is an 
excellent way of teaching grammar.  
 
• Use culturally appropriate examples. If students have to grapple with unfamiliar vocabulary and contexts when learning grammar, they will 
often not get the grammar points. British students being told to change the following sentence from passive to active will not see the 
vocabulary as a problem: “The soldiers, rashers and bangers were eaten by him for breakfast”. Bahamian students may.  
 
• Give students plenty of opportunities and encouragement to read, choosing at least some selections that have more sophisticated sentence 
structures than the literature that the students would ordinarily read by themselves.  
 
• Above all, be patient. It takes time to learn how to use conventions well.

APPENDIXC 
 
Meeting the Needs of ESL/LEP Students in the Mainstream Classroom 
 
1. The teacher will never have sufficient time to fill the linguistic gaps of all of his / her students. 
2. However, ESL/LEP students need daily contact with the second language.  In The Bahamas, we are fortunate because the students are already 
placed in an informal immersion setting when they are placed in a mainstream class (as opposed to a pull-out class). 
3. Students need to learn ESL in an anxiety-free classroom environment, because they have to summon twice the courage to risk expressing 
themselves in a new language. 
4. As much as possible, teachers are to allow the students to work at their own pace.  Therefore, they are to ensure that each lesson caters to 
several ability levels. The ‘readymade’ Backpack series, published by Longman (See the references, for how to find Backpack resources), does 
this for the teacher. 
5. Beginners, especially, need to hear the language before they are asked to look at the written words. Teachers should isolate audio assistance, 
where possible, by having students use headphones. 
6. Intermediate students, who may be able to do some reading (with comprehension) may be allowed to complete activities without audio 
assistance, but they too need to at least hear the new words pronounced before they are assigned the reading activity. 
7. The ESL/LEP teacher is not to overlook the importance of rote learning in the early stages.  This is how we all start to process our mother 
tongue in the first stages of language learning. Teachers must use contextualised short poems, chants, rap, songs. (Again, already prepared for 
the teacher in the Backpack series). 
8. Teachers must let students read –and answer comprehension questions to pictures–before they read print. 
9. Teachers are to integrate subjects and ensure that each lesson includes several different language learning skills / modes – listening, responding, 
reading, copying, guided writing, research, rote-memorisation, role plays, hands-on activities, etc. 


306 
 
10. Teachers are encouraged to remember that the skills should be taught in the order of the natural progression of language acquisition:  listening 
→ speaking → reading → writing →. This natural progression should not be broken, whatever the concept or language structure being taught / 
learnt.

ESL/LEP COMPREHENSION LESSON 
 
 
The following lesson illustrates how the teacher skilfully uses the natural progression of language acquisition:  listening → speaking → reading 
→ writing → 
Learning about Hurricanes 
Grade:8/9 
Topic:The Havoc of Hurricanes  
 
Duration of Lesson: 70 minutes 
AbilityRange: Mixed 
Objectives: Students will be able to: 
1. describe hurricanes, requesting and contributing information about hurricanes in a conversational exchange with a partner; 
2. demonstrate the ability to define key words; 
3. learn and use descriptive terms such as spiraling, cyclone, typhoon, humidity, and tropical to tell about hurricanes in oral and written 
formats; 
4. verbally recall conditions that must be present for a hurricane to form. 
Learning Resources:map, copies of passage about hurricane, video clip of a hurricane, LCD and an overhead screen, highlighters, index cards, 
markers 
Introduction: 
The teacher introduces the theme of the lesson by activating students’ background knowledge about hurricanes. He/She first shows a video-clip of 
a hurricane, then assigns students to work in pairs, each member of the pair telling the other two things he or she knows about hurricanes. Some of 
these are shared with the class. 


 
Development (Teacher & Student Activities):  
The teacher explains that hurricanes are nature’s largest storms. They can be as large as 600 to 1,000 miles wide, which is roughly the 
distance from Bimini to Haitior from New York to The Bahamas.The teacher then uses the map as a visual aid to show distance.  
 
Prior to reading, teacher tells students to listen and then look for three things that must be present for hurricanes to form. 
 
The teacher then reads aloud a short passage about hurricanes (copy of passage is to be found at end of the lesson), using stress, 
intonation, and brief pausing to alert students to key facts and key words for the lesson.  
 
The teacher stops during reading to elicit from students definitions to key words (hurricane, typhoon, cyclone, violent, swirling, 
cluster, spinning, maximum, intense, typically, tropical),writes the key words on 4 x 6 index cards, and posts them on the word wall, if 
there is one, preferably next to the chalkboard.  
 
The teacher distributes the passage about hurricanes and has students read along with him/her a second time, following in their own 
text. 
 
Using their highlighters, students highlight key ideas and vocabulary.  
 
Next, the teacher asks students what important facts about hurricanes were learned during the lesson.The students orally respond to the 
questions and state facts learned about hurricanes(e.g., size, strength, effects)from their reading selection, the short video and their 
prior knowledge.Prompted by the teacher, they verbally recall conditions that must be present for a hurricane to form. 
 
The teacher asks the students to write down at least one question about what else they might want to know about hurricanes, based on 
the lesson.For example, after having learnt that hurricanes form over warm oceans, students might ask, “How warm must the water be 
for a hurricane to form?

Conclusion: 
Students, guided by teacher, summarize the lesson.Teacher explains the follow-up activities. 
 
Follow-Up Activities 
Students research the answers to their question and different names of hurricanes in other languages (any language – French, Spanish, 
Chinese, Hindi, etc.). They also write ashort one paragraph /a short essay/a longer essay, (depending on ability level) descriptive, 
narrative or expository, on hurricanes. 
 
NB: Modifications and accommodations are built into the lesson through the use of visual aids (video) andleveling of text. Other 
accommodations include repeating directionsand preferential seating. Another modification is to simplify the level of language used 
by the teacher and expected from the student.

Teachers can level this passage, making it more difficult or easier, according to the linguistic ability of the students.  
What is it? 
A hurricane is the most violent storm on earth. The name hurricane comes from the Mayan storm god Hunraken and the Arawak word 
hurican, which meant devil wind. A hurricane is a swirling storm measuring 60 –1,000 miles wide that forms over warm ocean 
waters. Hurricanes start life as a cluster of strong thunderstorms moving across the ocean, called a tropical disturbance or tropical 
wave.  
Atmospheric conditions must be just right to turnthese strong thunderstorms into a hurricane – very few of them ever become full-
blown hurricanes.One of these conditions is ocean water temperatures that are quite hot. This provides the storm with the heat-energy 
it needs to grow. That's why hurricanes in this region happen from Junethrough November, when ocean temperatures are warmest. 
September 10 is the peak of the Atlantic Ocean's hurricane season. 
A tropical wave needs to begin spinning to become a hurricane. A tropical wave that begins spinning around a center of low pressure 
is called a tropical depression. Tropical depressions have maximum sustained wind speeds of less than 40 mph at the ocean's surface. 
When the maximum winds reach 40 mph or greater, the storm changes into a tropical storm, becomes strong and dangerous and it is 
given a name. The storm name is always used in all weather warnings. Using a name helps people tell one storm from another and 
follow its movements.Official storm trackers all over the world have lists of names ready.  
Once the maximum winds reach 74 mph or greater, the storm becomes a hurricane. Category 3, 4, and 5 hurricanes are all called 
intense or major hurricanes. These intense hurricanes cause over 70% of the damage in the United States and The Bahamas.  
Each hurricane has an eye of calm winds and low pressure, surrounded by powerful thunderstorms with high winds and heavy rain. 
Hurricanes typically last from two to fourteen days. They tend to move from east to west, at speeds between 10 and 30 mph. 
Another name for a hurricane is atropical cyclone. These storms are called typhoons when they take place in the western Pacific 
Ocean, and are known as cyclones in the Indian and southern Pacific Oceans.

GRADE: 7-9 
 
DATE:  31st OCTOBER, 2011 
SUBJECT: Language Arts 
 
DURATION: 70 MINS 
TOPIC:  PUBLIC SPEAKING 
 
ABILITYRANGE: Mixed 
 
OBJECTIVES:  Students will be able to: 
 
 
1. present information orally in different genres (e.g. informative speech, interviews) 
2. compose speeches for a variety of occasions 
 
LEARNING RESOURCES:  Television, Literature Text, Magazines, a book of fairy tales 
 
INTRODUCTION:  Teacher will discuss with students the importance of being able to speak well before an audience.  He or she will 
point out that whether one is a celebrity being interviewed, a politician speakingat a rally or an employee speaking before a group of 
supervisors, it is important to be able to speak before an audience. 
 
DEVELOPMENT: 
TEACHER’S ACTIVITIES 
STUDENTS’ ACTIVITIES 
The teacher will tell the students that today’s lesson will centre 
around public speaking and ask students for examples of public 
speaking. 
Students will give examples of public speaking. 
The teacher will show students (on television or DVD) several 
examples of public speakers and ask students what makes the 
speeches interesting. 
Students will listen to speeches and say what they find interesting 
about the speeches.

The teacher will place students in pairs, with one student 
pretending to be a news anchor and the other a newsmaker (e.g. 
celebrity, politician).  The teacher will ask students to formulate 
questions and answers for an interview which will be broadcast 
on television.  The teacher will ask the students to conduct the 
interview in front of the class. 
Students will work in pairs to formulate questions for an 
interview and then conduct the interview in front of the class. 
For advanced students, the teacher will ask students to compose 
or read a speech with different tones/emotions, being sure to 
capture the different moods of the speech. 
Alternatively, the teacher will ask the students to read parts of 
their Literature text, capturing the different moods and characters 
through their voice intonation. 
Students will compose original speeches with different 
tones/emotions and present them to the class or read aloud from 
their Literature texts passages that have different moods and/or 
characters, emphasizing the differences with their voice 
intonation. 
For the remedial students and/or ESL students, the teacher will 
write short sentences on slips of paper and ask students to 
determine the mood of the sentences and read them aloud 
accordingly. 
Students will read aloud from the slips of paper. 
 
 
CONCLUSION:  The teacher will review the importance of speaking as a means of communication. 
 
EVALUATION: 
Depending on the size of the class, the teacher might want to conduct this lesson over the span of several classes, especially the 
presentations.  Once students have composed their speeches in one class period, the teacher might want to allow a limited number of 
students to present their speeches during the first ten to fifteen minutes of each class until everyone is finished; especially if it is a 
mixed class, as students can easily become restless if they are forced to listen to speeches for an entire class period.  After the students 
have given their presentations, the teacher might want to begin another lesson on another topic.

In preparation for the lesson, the teacher has taped several 
television commercials – fast food restaurant, retail automobile 
company, clothes store, etc.  After instructing students to listen 
out for facts and opinions from each commercial and take notes, 
the teacher presents these advertisements, using the audio-visual 
equipment. 
Students will watch and listen attentively, making notes and 
jotting down facts and opinions from each commercial.  
 Teacher asks students to identify the facts and opinions which 
were presented as a part of the commercial. 
Students give the facts and opinions gleaned from the 
commercials. 
*Teacher arranges the students in small groups, with each group 
responsible for writing and performing a 30-second-long 
commercial about something (an aloe product, a jitney company, 
toothpaste, some special Bahamian food, etc.), including facts and 
opinions.  Each group has a scribe.  Teacher encourages students 
to be creative. 
*Working in small groups, students write a creative 30-second-
long commercial that includes facts and opinions about a real or 
fictitious product. 
Teacher asks each group to present their commercial, privately 
assigning a grade for use of facts and opinions, and for 
effectiveness.   
Groups present their commercials.  Following each presentation, 
the rest of the class identifies the facts and opinions heard.  
Students also constructively critique the effectiveness of each 
commercial in terms of its content. 
**If possible, the teacher video-records the students’ 
commercials.  In a follow-up lesson, the teacher shows their 
commercials on the television and has the students write down 
ororallyidentify each fact and opinion from their classmates’ 
commercials.  A discussion should ensue.

LEARNING RESOURCES: copies of an altered literary passage;brief, teacher-generated paragraphs comprising fragments and run-
on sentences 
 
INTRODUCTION: Teacher has students briefly review run-on sentences and fragments: on the whiteboard or chalkboard, teacher 
presents several examples of each type of error. Students identify which type of error each example reflects. E.g. When John opened 
the door he was stunned leaping back in fear he recognized several of the people in the room before he turned around and ran(run-on 
sentence) The tourists who come to this country expecting to be greeted by happy, smiling natives who are delighted to serve them 
(fragment).Questions to be asked include: What is a run-on sentence? How can we recognize it? What is a fragment? How can we 
recognize one? Why is it important to avoid writing such errors? What problems do they create for readers? Teacher then explains the

students that when he/she assesses their next written assignment, a key part of the assessment will be their ability to write fluent, 
complete and controlled sentences. 
 
Teacher gives students copies of a passage taken from a literary text 
(prose) that has been a part of their course of study or that is 
presently being studied. In preparation for the lesson, the teacher has 
rewritten several paragraphs from the passage so that they comprise 
run-on sentences and fragments.  
 
Teacher asks students to read the passage, identifying the paragraphs 
that have been re-written to comprise run-ons and fragments and 
commenting on how the change has affected their ability to enjoy 
understand the passage.  
 
*Teacher arranges the students in small groups, with each group 
responsible for proofreading a brief, teacher-generated paragraph 
comprising fragments and run-on sentences.  
 
Teacher displays each paragraph on the whiteboard and asks a 
representative from the group assigned the paragraph to point out the 
errors and then present the group’s revised version.  
 
 
 
 
 
Students read the passage (several do so orally), identifying the paragraphs 
that have been re-written to comprise run-ons and fragments. The class 
comments on how the change has affected the reader’s ability to engage 
with the passage.  
 
 
*Working in groups, students correct the fragments and run-on sentences 
in their given paragraph.  
 
 
A representative from each group assigned a paragraph approaches the 
whiteboard and points out the errors, and then presents the revised version 
by reading it. * The group comprising accelerated learners will comment 
on and present only a portion of their revised essay, with the teacher’s 
judicious guidance.

EVALUATION: 
This lesson took two classes.  Many of the slower learners found this lesson difficult so the teacher had to spend a lot of time with 
those students and had to assign at least one advanced learner to those groups to help them along. 
As students often find grammar tedious and difficult, the teacher had to exercise a lot of patience and move slowly, especially for the 
slower learners and ESL students. 
The teacher should come back to this lesson periodically to refresh students’ memories about complex sentences.  
It is also recommended that when discussing the Literature text, the Literature teacher might also discuss the various types of 
sentences the writer uses and the effect of each type of sentence.

Teacher will tell students what the topic for the day’s 
lesson is. Afterwards, she will ask “What is persuasive 
writing?  Teacher will provide a definition. 
 
 Teacher will explain what an advertisement is. After 
which, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, she will 
introduce and explain the techniques that the class will 
focus on (i.e. loaded words, basic needs appeal, expert 
opinion, testimonial, bandwagon and slogan). 
 
 
Teacher will give students an assignment. She will provide 
them with a mark scheme. 
 
She will advise students to become creative and use a 
range of resources such as technology.

CONCLUSION – The teacher will review definition (of persuasive writing) and persuasive techniques. 
 
FOLLOWING UP – Students will research and find other persuasive techniques. 
 
EVALUATION:  
This lesson took three classes. The first class was about thirty minutes because of a general assembly. As a result, the students had to 
create their advertisements at home. The teacher encouraged them to use PowerPoint and other aspects of technology to make the 
presentation as persuasive and creative as possible.  
When it was time to present, the students were eager to share their ideas. Many presented with the aid of PowerPoint, CD players and 
dramatizations. One student actually did an original video and had it on a DVD for the class to view.  
The teacher was extremely pleased because the students listened attentively to each presentation and frequently helped the 
presenter/student to identify the persuasive techniques and support in the advertisements. The creativity grades assigned (by the 
students) were similar to the teacher’s. In the end, the students received above average marks on both assignments; thus, it was clear 
that they understood the concepts taught. 
The lesson did have one ‘hiccup’ and this occurred when the laptop froze. However, this did not stop the presentations because not all 
students needed to use the laptop and LCD.  
The lesson went well.

DEVELOPMENT  
 
 
METHODS AND TECHNIQUES 
STUDENTS’ ACTIVITIES 
1. The teacher will give students copies of the song and ask 
them to look at it.  She will ask them the following 
questions: How is the song written?  Why do you think it 
is written this way?  
Students will respond to the question by stating what they observe 
about the song. 
1. The teacher will then give students copies of a poem.  She 
will ask students to discuss how they are different and 
how they are alike.  Students will be asked to record their 
observations on a T-Chart. 
Students will point out differences and similarities between the 
poem and the song.  They will complete the T-Chart and share 
what they have written. 
2. The teacher will inform students that, as they have 
discovered, poems and songs are similar.  They both 
employ the same techniques.  An example would be the 
way they are written.  The teacher will then point out other 
ways that they are alike (the use of figurative language, 
rhythm, rhyme, etc.).  
Students will listen attentively and write notes.  They will ask 
questions as needed. 
3. The teacher will introduce the class to an auto-bio poem.  
The teacher will then explain that this kind of poem 
follows a format and it reveals something about the poet.  
The teacher will then read an example of this kind of 
poem and after reading, will give students copies of the 
format.  Students will then write poems of their own. 
Students will listen to the reading and write poems of their own. 
4. The teacher will assist students as they write. 
Students will complete poems. 
5. The teacher will ask volunteers to share what they have 
written. 
Some students will share their poems. 
 
CONCLUSION: Students will state how poems and songs are similar and different.

CURRICULUM REVIEW LITERATURE LESSON PLAN 
 
CLASS/SET:  GRADES 10 – 12   
NO. OF STUDENTS: 24 – 30  
SUBJECT:LITERATURE 
 
TOPIC:  Writer’s use of mood 
DURATION: 1hr   
 
 
ABILITYRANGE:  High, middle or low 
 
******************************************************************************* 
 
OBJECTIVES  Students will be able to :- 
i) 
define the term ‘mood’ 
ii) 
identify mood created in a selected poem 
iii) 
differentiate between ‘mood’ and ‘tone’ 
 
INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES 
i) 
lap-top/LCD/OHP presentation 
ii) 
dry-white board and markers 
iii) 
Mervyn Morris’ poem ‘Little Boy Crying’ to be found on page 48 ‘Touched with Fire’ 
iv) 
William Golding’s ‘Lord of the Flies’ (accelerated learners) 
 
CONTENT 
 
 
 
‘Mood’ and ‘tone’ are literary techniques that students sometimes confuse or fail to identify. They 
are, notwithstanding, essential components of the writer’s craft. Students need to appreciate that ‘mood’ is an 
atmosphere that the writer wishes to create which may directly or indirectly affect the reader; whereas, ‘tone’ is an 
expression of the writer’s own feelings or attitude towards a subject, situation or event. This lesson on ‘mood’ has 
been designed with mostly middle to high achievers in mind. However, a slower approach or a reduction in activities 


21 
 
21 
 
would accommodate lower achievers, whilst the accelerated learner should also be able to participate fully in this 
lesson and be stimulated by the challenges of the follow-up activity indicated. It is expected that ‘tone’ has already 
been taught prior to this lesson. 
 
KEY QUESTIONS 
i) 
What is ‘mood’? 
ii) 
How is ‘mood’ different from ‘tone’? 
iii) 
How does the writer create the desired mood in his writing? 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
 
 
Assuming the teacher has already taught ‘tone’, he/she may desire to review this literary element 
at this stage to elicit some prior knowledge from the students before continuing. If this is not felt necessary, then 
the following introduction might catch the students’ attention: 
 
The teacher or a selected student (one well-known for having a certain talent for the dramatic) enters the 
class-room displaying an immediately identifiable ‘mood’. This ‘mood’ could be ‘lively’, ‘depressed’, ‘angry’ or just plain 
‘happy’. (Voice, small gifts, tears or other emotional signals should be used to reflect the mood). The dramatic 
presentation should be followed by questions such as: “What sort of mood is the teacher or student in?”; “What is 
‘mood’?”; “How was the ‘mood’ demonstrated in the dramatic presentation?”  
This series of questions should be followed by the teacher explaining that today’s lesson will be dealing with ‘mood’ and 
how writers create and use this literary element. The teacher will then direct students’ attention towards a visual 
presentation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


22 
 
22 
 
DEVELOPMENT: 
 
TEACHER’S ACTIVITIES 
STUDENTS’ ACTIVITIES 
i) Using ‘Power Point’, an OHP or other medium of visual 
presentation, the teacher will provide a definition of ‘mood’. 
Students will note down this definition and contrast it with 
the definition of ‘tone’ given in a prior lesson. 
ii) Teacher will use another slide/transparency to list various 
types of mood (e.g. anger, joy).  
Students, as they write, could be encouraged to display each 
mood (facially) or give a verbal explanation. 
iii) Teacher will use additional slides/transparencies to 
outline techniques that can be used to create mood (setting, 
colour, character’s actions and reactions). 
Students will note the chosen techniques to create mood and 
add their own explanations or ones provided by the teacher. 
iv) Teacher will ask students to turn to Page 48 of Touched 
with Fire to locate the poem ‘Little Boy Crying’ by Mervyn 
Morris. 
A selected student or students will read the poem aloud as 
other students identify and respond to the various moods 
created in each stanza. 
v) Teacher will explain vocabulary where needed (e.g. 
metamorphosed) and discuss the mood created in each 
stanza, and techniques used, with the students.  
 In groups, students could be encouraged to act out the poem, 
with one student playing the role of the child, another 
student the adult, and other students acting as 
commentators.   
vi) Teacher will draw a table on the board and label it:  
a) Mood; b) Technique; c) Support. 
In pairs or individually, students will draw and fill in the table 
copied from the board. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Depending on the number of activities completed:- 
 
i)  Teacher will ensure that students know the difference between ‘tone’ and ‘mood’ by eliciting responses to 
general review questions based on the day’s lesson. 
 
ii)  Selected students could begin filling out the table drawn on the board. 
 
 


23 
 
23 
 
 
FOLLOWING UP: 
Low achievers: 
These students could continue with the activities listed above including the completion of the table. 
Middle to high achievers: These students should be able to complete the table and then write a paragraph or two on how 
the poet creates mood in the poem ‘Little Boy Crying’. 
High achievers: 
These students should look at selected passages from a novel such as Golding’s ‘Lord of the Flies’ and 
analyze how the author creates mood and ultimately tension in his writing e.g. the murder of Simon. Following the dramatic 
presentations during the lesson, the analysis of Morris’ poem and the completion of a literary appreciation based on a passage 
from Golding’s novel, students will appreciate the importance of ‘mood’ in all three genres of literature.

CONTRIBUTIONS BY WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS 
 
 
In a workshop held during the summer of 2011, participants compiled a number of suggestions for using local resources in the 
Language Arts classroom.  Teachers are encouraged to use these and other local material when developing lessons for their students. 
Workshop participants are gratefully acknowledged for their contribution to the development of this revised curriculum. 
 
Stylistic Devices Used By Local Writers: Compiled By Workshop Participants 
 
DePass, Iris.Extract from “Mail Boat to New Providence” in Comprehension Our Way. Unpublished Manuscript. 
 
 
Travel to New Providence was an infrequent treat.  We, who lived in the southeastern islands, would sail for two days on a 
mail boat.  This made the journey a forty-eight hour fast because the constant motion of the boat as it mounted the oncoming waves, 
and its sharp descent into the valleys beneath, made eating impossible for us children.  What really made matters worse was the smell 
of the boat. Boats normally have a scent of their own that is not too disagreeable when one is standing on land or just taking a brief 
tour.  But when one’s stay amounted to more than a few hours, the smell of paint, irregularly sanitized bathrooms, and food being 
prepared or regurgitated, became overbearing. 
 
We travelled on the Motor Vessel Commonwealth, which was the boat assigned to our island.  It was the largest boat I had 
ever seen and was painted yellow, orange and white.  It had three decks: upper, middle and lower.  The upper deck was where our 
room was.  We were allowed to go to the front of the boat to watch the billowing waves and to catch some fresh air. The middle deck 
was where the kitchen, dominated by a plump Jamaican cook, was located.  The aroma coming from there added to the pandemonium 
of sickness experienced by us even though, on a different surface, the scent would have been quite pleasing.   
 
On the journey to Nassau, we would all stay in a small, box-shaped room which contained six single berths.  These were 
simply single mattresses inserted in wooden frames.  Three lay on the floor and the other three were mounted exactly above them on 
the partition. …On some trips, other passengers would share the room.  These would be trips when only my parents and I travelled, 
when all of the bunks in the room were not occupied. …But normally, one room was given per family. 


27 
 
27 
 
 
I remember lying on the top bunk, looking out the window at the angry waves and wondering where they ended.  They were all 
very blue, the most perfect blue I had ever seen.  Their dangerous beauty made me feel refreshed but slightly nervous.  This blue 
became a glorious aquamarine as we passednearby islands and cays. … 
 
In the mornings, I would be sent to the bathroom.  This journey would be almost trance-like because of the emptiness in my 
stomach.  With the thought of seasickness ever present, I would cringe in disgust at the state in which I normally found the bathroom.  
It was near the main engine:a towering, black, greasy giant spewing fumes and roaring loudly.  It seemed to want to swallow me, and 
its location added to the nausea.  As the boat rocked, I sometimes thought about the tragic end I would meet if I accidentally were to 
be propelled in the direction of this bellowing monster. … 
 
When New Providence was in sight, we would go to the stern of the boat and watch as it approached the harbour.  The stern 
was the most interesting part of the boat for the captain’s room was right beneath it, and one was privileged to see a little of what was 
going on in there through the glass panel right under the helm.  We would stare in awe as we saw the wheel with its many points and 
other complicated instruments that the captain used.  Sometimes we would wave at the captain and to our delight he would wave back 
at us. 
 
After docking, we would excitedly get dressed.  This was a busy time for my parents who usually brought crops to sell.  These 
consisted of pigeon peas stored in crocus sacks that had been meticulously sewn shut by my father to prevent spillage, theft, and 
mistaken identity. 
 
I never grasped exactly what it was that they had to do concerning the crops when we arrived in Nassau but it seemed like a 
lot of work.  I knew they had to hire a truck to transport the goods to the Produce Exchange.  My father would be back and forth in 
evident frustration.  My mother would listen and give advice. 
 
Eventually we would leave the boat and be taken into Nassau.  I never remembered the journey to where we stayed because I 
always fell into a deep sleep brought on by the frenzy that had occurred on the boat as we docked. 
 
Just being in Nassau was spectacular. It was an adventure not afforded to many.  Nassau was like another world.  Suddenly, 
everything seemed alive and moving.  There were many boisterous people everywhere, noisy, speeding vehicles, and many bright 
lights.  Most significantly, Nassau had the famous fast-food restaurants.  These were what made the trip memorable.  No trip to 
Nassau was worth telling about unless you had many accounts of the meals you ate here and there.  It was during one of my first trips 
to McDonalds, that I ordered a Big Mac.  To my surprise, after I opened the brown box in which the sandwich came, I discovered a 
hamburger topped with seeds – benny seeds. 
I exclaimed, “It has benny seeds on it!” 
 
On the island I was used to benny cakes that were made during Christmas or on birthdays, but I never imagined any other use 
for this seed.  Benny, according to my knowledge, was made to be served as a sweet treat.  What a wonder this new display was!  I 
assumed then and there that the Big Mac tasted awful. 


28 
 
28 
 
 
As I surveyed the sandwich, I wanted to cry.  I could not understand how I could enjoy a hamburger ridiculously sprinkled 
with benny.  Because of this unexpected discovery, my outing was almost ruined.  I ate only the fries and drank the wonderful 
milkshake that was ordered for me.  Later I learned that these seeds were not only a common staple in Nassau, garnishing many types 
of bread, but were known as sesame seeds.  “Benny” was taboo.  It was a word to be used only in our small, island towns.  Eventually, 
the Big Mac became one of my favourite sandwiches. 
 
I saw many other things for the first time like the Queen’s Staircase.  I remember counting the sixty-five steps and asking about 
the missing one used in its name.  I also recall visiting the Straw Market and being baffled by the constant activities going on there: 
the horse ‘n’ carriages that passed, the many tourists engaged in purchasing souvenirs, and the colourful rhetoric of the vendors 
trying to attract and sell their wares to customers. 
 
Buying ice-cream from the ice-cream van was unforgettable too.  I always longed to be able to stop the van daily in order to 
delight in the many treats it had to offer. 
 
All this and more happened during my childhood trips to Nassau.

Armbrister, Cindy Lee.Extract from Broken Fences. Nassau: Yellow Elder Publishers, 1999. 
 
 
The following day was designated an official day of mourning.  We did not go to church.  Nobody was in the mood.  News had 
spread quickly in the small community and women from all over came to share Mammy’s grief.  They came in long gingham shifts and 
aprons, their faces sombre.  In their hands, they carried washcloths and dishcloths with which they blew their stuffed noses.  Brightly 
coloured head cloths covered their heads mocking the seriousness of their visits.  When they left, they carried the truth with them.  
Ella’s daughter, Angel, you know the smart one who had gone to Nassau and who the gov’ner was payin’ to go to school was loaded 
down with baby.  That was the truth ’cause they got it from the horse’s mouth. 
 
One particular mourner came for more than learning the truth.  She came to share Mammy’s grief.  Mammy sat in the back 
yard on a flint rock beside the cherry tree.  Louise, my older sister, and I were sprawled on a similar rock in front of the outdoor 
kitchen.  We weren’t aware of the seriousness of the situation, but we mourned nonetheless.  When the letter had come the day before, 
after she had regained some of her senses, Mammy berated us for being a bunch of no-good gal brats.  So, we cried whenever she 
looked our way.  It seemed to say we were sorry.  
 Aun’ Ada greeted us in her usual mournful way.  “How yinna doing, girls?” 
“Fine Aunt Ada” we answered.  She was not a blood relation, but we called her aunt just as we did every woman in the 
community.  We could see that Aun’ Ada was truly burdened and unsure how to reveal the purpose of her visit.  My sister poked me in 
the side.  I struggled to keep a straight face as we waited for Aun’ Ada to ask us about Angel.  As I stared at her solemn face, I could 
see the restrained sorrow etching lines all over her face.   
“Your ma home?” She asked finally. 
“Yes, ma’am,” Louise replied.  “She’s in the backyard.” 
We followed her.  When Aun’ Ada rounded the corner of the house, Mammy was distractedly picking at the leaves of the young 
cherry tree.  She approached Mammy hesitantly and greeted her sorrowfully. 
“Ella, chile, how you?” 
Mammy replied, “Chile, Ada, I alright.  How you?” 
“Ah,chile, I alright except my pressure high.  Even though I drink the breadfruit leaf tea to keep my blood cool, it still high.” 
A silence fell.  Mammy did not look up nor respond to that.  Aun’ Ada joined her on the rock.  Both waited for the other to 
speak..  Aun’ Ada did the honors.  Clearing her throat noisily, she asked, “Ella, das true what I hear ‘bout Angel?” 


30 
 
30 
 
Mammy sat motionless, not sure how to answer.  Then realizing that everybody else knew about her shame, she decided that it 
couldn’t hurt for this woman to know.  “Yes, Ada, that’s true.” 
A thunderbolt hit Aun’ Ada.  To our surprise, she was sprawled on the ground wallowing like a pig.  Mournful sounds escaped 
from her lips.  Fine pebbles and dust rose as her clawing hands clutched wildly at the ground.  The cherry tree shook and swayed. 
Louise and I stood frozen, numb with shock.  Aun’ Ada was having a fit!  We knew of her history of high blood pressure and 
high-strung nature and we feared for her well-being.  Quickly we ran over to the scene being played out by the little tree.  By that 
time, Mammy had risen to help her.  As she bent over to calm her, Aun’ Ada grabbed her and held on to her desperately. 
“Ah Ella,,” we heard her moan.  “What a tragedy.  All you do for these gal brats, they jus’ turn ‘round and disgrace poor 
parents.  Oh God, what troubles and trials we gotta endure.” 
Aun’ Ada was theatrical to say the least.  Once,she had not recognized any of her children and the doctor had sent her to 
Sandilands for treatment.  She had regained her memory but ever since, she had to stay on Valium.  As she performed, Mammy 
became envious.  Throwing all pride to the wind, she joined Aun’ Ada on the ground and thrashed about wildly and frantically.  The 
tender cherry tree lay battered and bruised from the weight of the flailing bodies. 
Mammy’s mourning was in full gear now.  Her headcloth slipped low over her forehead and the Joseph-coat leaves that she 
had put under it earlier for a headache, peeped enquiringly out on the unfolding scene.  Mammy threw her A-lined dress over her 
head and bawled.  Her cries echoed for miles.  We had never heard Mammy cry like that.  The commotion summoned Daddy to the 
backyard. 
“What happen to that woman?  Why she carrying on like a fool?” 
I looked at Daddy.  “This big-time crying Daddy.”  The three of us stood there surveying the incredible scene before our eyes.  
The two women remained entangled, oblivious to their audience, their pitiful cries shattering the peace, the medicinal leaves hanging 
on for dear life.  The cherry tree lay demolished, stripped and exposed.  Daddy was enraged when he sawwhat they had done to this 
tree.  He had been nurturing it for months.  He rushed over to the women. 
“You’ll is two big fools,” he declared.  “Dis make sense?  Look at my cherry tree that I was taking care of for so long.” 
Mammy regained her senses, then.  She stopped wallowing in the dirt and glanced around as if to catch her bearings.  
Noticing us for the first time, she picked herself up and attempted to straighten her clothes.  She untied her headcloth, straightened the 
leaves securely under it and retied it again. 
“Ada, chile, pick yourself up!” she ordered. 
Aun’ Ada pushed her headcloth and the leaves off her face and retied them securely around her forehead. 
“Ah John bulla,” she wailed.  “This is the thanks yinna get.”

However, in Daddy she didn’t find a mourning partner for he seldom let his feathers get ruffled.  Sure, he had been upset when 
he had heard the news but he did not make a big showy display of his reaction.  Only dat crazy woman was making a mountain out of 
a molehill, bawling like a cow all over the place.

Activities Developed by Workshop Participants for Objective 7: 
 
“Identify and compose sentences that are classified according to their structure – Simple and Compound.” 
 
 
Academically Challenged Students 
 
1. With computerized assistance, students read ten individual sentences in which verbs are highlighted.  Students select S or C to 
indicate sentence types using the smart board. 
2. Using scrambled sentences on the computer, students select words to create simple and compound sentences.  Conjunctions 
will be red in colour, and verbs will be blue. 
3. After teaching and giving examples on both, divide the class into three with sample simple sentences, conjunctions and 
clauses.  Let students create compound sentences.  They will have to do a walkabout and find appropriate sentences and 
conjunctions. 
 
Exceptional Learners 
 
1. Have students re-write the ending to a Literature text being studied, identifying examples of simple and compound sentences, 
and conjunctions being used. 
2. Project an extract from a Literature text or newspaper/magazine on thewhite board.  In groups, students identify as many 
simple and compound sentences as they can in a specified time period.  Groups use different coloured markers to identify the 
different types of sentences.  Students respond in writing to the original article using a variety of simple and compound 
sentences
