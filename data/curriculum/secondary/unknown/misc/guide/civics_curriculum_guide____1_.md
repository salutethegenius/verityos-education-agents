Civics Senior High School Curriculum- The Bahamas                                                                                                      3 
PREFACE 
Civics is the study of government and citizenship.  Civics education is clearly participatory and requires young citizens to 
participate in a democratic process.  There are too many persons who are not aware of their rights and responsibilities.  
The increase in violence against persons, properties and social unrest indicate this need.  This requires that the populace 
receive training on matters related to civics.    
According to the United Nations Democratic Principles Programme “civics education is learning for effective participation 
in democratic and development processes at both local and national levels.  Some of the basic tenets of democracy are 
exposed in civics education.  These are the principles of transparency, participation, responsiveness, accountability, 
empowerment and equity.   
Civics education is simply defined by vocabulary.com as something related to or benefits an individual citizen.  People 
often say that it is your civic duty to vote.  The adjective civic comes from the Latin word civis, which was the word for a 
citizen of Ancient Rome. It is also a root word for "city," so civic can also mean anything related to a city.  
Civics education is important to democratic nations in the region and many countries have reinstituted the implementation 
of a civics course in every school.  In Jamaica, they have modelled a Civics programme after legendary civil rights 
activists Marcus Garvey.  In the United States, all 50 states have the subject as a core area in high school.  For example, 
in Chicago Illinois schools, it is mandatory and a prerequisite for a graduation diploma.   
Aim: 
To educate students about their duties and responsibilities as citizens of the country, and to enable them to understand 
how democracy and the Westminster system of government, works in the commonwealth.   
Civics education will help to develop critical thinking skills as students will be engage in civil discussions, debating 
controversial issues, have lively topical arguments on government and the democratic process while respecting the 
diverse multiculturalism that exist in the country.  
Civics education a mandatory course for all 10th-12th grade students, is taught once per week, during a fifty minute time 
period. It helps to promote democracy, minimizes discrimination, polarization and promotes tolerance, respect and 
appreciation for governance.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
Civics education is learning for effective participation in democratic and development processes at both local and international levels.  
Ideally, this became the nomenclature used by various advisors, researchers and stakeholders.  Hence, this perspective was 
undertaken by Deputy Director Sharon Poitier who started the conceptual framework for this document.   The concept built, was to 
produce the ideal high school graduate as a competent Bahamian citizen.  Additionally, a special thanks is given to Ms. Serethea 
Clarke, former Under Secretary who served as a Deputy Director for Curriculum and Instruction in the Department of Education when 
the revision work began.  
Special appreciation is extended to Mr. Cyril Stevenson, Professor at the University of The Bahamas who helped to design culturally 
relevant topics.  A heartfelt appreciation is also extended to Ms. Leisel Wright from the Writing Unit, Department of Education, who 
took the lead in guiding writers and hosting meetings for the curriculum team.  This document would not have been completed 
without the supervision of Perlene Lewis-Baker, Social Science Education Officer who supervised the curriculum writing team and 
carried out extensive research on various topics.  
Invariably, the work of this document would not be completed without the assistance of Teachers, Subject Coordinators and 
representatives from The School of Social Sciences at the University of The Bahamas.  
Lastly, an appreciation is extended to the curriculum writers who worked tirelessly reviewing and editing the document. Special 
thanks to:

INTRODUCTION 
 
Civics education prepares students to become avid readers, listeners and effective communicators.  Students will gain the 
knowledge of understanding the structure and function of government.  Students will learn about democratic processes 
such as voting and selecting a government of their choice.  They will be able to discuss the three main branches of 
government, the legislature, executive branch and the judiciary.  These three branches help to cultivate a culture where 
opportunities such as employment, political freedom, rights of citizens and financial gains help to improve the livelihood of 
citizens in a democracy.  
 
 
The purpose of a Civics curriculum is to develop students’ knowledge of political and legal institutions and explores the 
nature of citizenship in a liberal democracy.  A focus on contemporary issues, such as debates over changes in law and 
world governments’ responses to international events, provides a means of developing students’ thinking and critical 
capacities. These issues provide ways that citizens can actively participate, question and improve democracy.  Students 
will develop general skills and capabilities such as an appreciation of diverse perspectives, empathy, collaboration, 
negotiation, self-awareness and intercultural understanding.

HOW TO USE THE CIVICS CURRICULUM GUIDELINES 
 
 
Civics education is a social science that exposes students to rights and duties as a citizen. The civics curriculum 
document is designed to empower students and prepare them to be well-informed, active participants in a democratic 
society.  The guide is also design to help students develop critical thinking and argumentative skills.   
 
 
The civics curriculum guide objectives are used as examples for teachers and does not mean that they have to follow 
what is scripted in the document.  Additionally, teachers and stakeholders who view the document can use the guide to 
prepare lessons.  However, it is not mandatory for teachers to follow the scope and sequence but be able to integrate the 
strands in schemes of work.  Moreover, it is recommended that teachers extrapolate from the curriculum assessment 
techniques to help build rigorous and best practices.
