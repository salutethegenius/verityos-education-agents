PREFACE 
 
 
This document incorporates revisions of unpublished curricula produced during numerous curriculum 
development exercises conducted by the Department of Education over the past thirty years. The objectives 
and content outlined in the Curriculum Guidelines were formulated based on national goals, current research 
and best practices in mathematics, as well as entry-level requirements for programmes at the University of The 
Bahamas and other local, regional, and international colleges and universities.   
The quest for a more coherent and relevant mathematics curriculum began after the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) officially released its Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School 
Mathematics (NCTM 1989). The Standards provided a new vision and framework for strengthening the 
mathematics curriculum. It provided the impetus for revamping the Bahamian mathematics curriculum and 
producing a document to guide the improvement of teaching and learning mathematics in both public and 
private schools. 
Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), Curriculum Focal Points for Pre-K–Grade 8 
Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence (NCTM 2006) and other NCTM publications were also considered as the 
High School Mathematics Curriculum team created the Curriculum Guidelines. In keeping with NCTM's 
vision that is based on the assumption that all students are capable of learning mathematics, the Curriculum 
Guidelines provides a framework to foster an understanding of the ‘whats’,  ‘whys’,  and ‘hows’ of 
mathematics, and ensures alignment of the content within and across all the high school grade levels, from 
grade 7 to grade 12. 
It is envisioned that teachers and parents, in home-school and homework settings, will use this document to 
guide their planning and teaching. The Scope and Sequence, Scope of Work, Strategies, and the suggested 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   4 
supplementary activities from texts and other resources, can be used to develop a high-quality learning 
experience that will help students attain the goals and objectives outlined.  
 
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

INTRODUCTION 
 
Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry 
and commerce, and as such, is essential in everyday life. Critical thinking, problem solving, 
and communicating ideas effectively are keys to success in a technology driven, 
information-based world. 
 
The study of mathematics requires reasoning, applying, analyzing, and understanding 
of principles, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Studying mathematics equips students 
with the knowledge, skills, and mindset that are essential for meaningful participation in 
society.  
A high-quality mathematics programme provides the foundation for understanding the 
world, adapting to rapid change in the digital age, and producing twenty-first century global 
citizens. All students need classroom experiences that will help them learn mathematics with 
understanding, make connections, and apply mathematics in other contexts. An effective 
mathematics programme also develops an appreciation for the beauty and power of 
mathematics, and a sense of enjoyment and desire to learn more about the subject. 
 
The focus of the Mathematics High School Curriculum is the content knowledge, 
understanding, and skills needed to educate students to appreciate and utilize mathematics. It 
outlines the framework that mathematics educators can use to create yearly schemes, design 
unit and lessons plans, and produce materials that will enhance the teaching and learning 
process, and ensure that their students become critical thinkers who can reason 
mathematically and solve problems.

OVERARCHING GOALS 
  
The High School Mathematics Curriculum is designed to cultivate and develop 
students who are: 
a) proficient in logical, critical and analytical reasoning; 
b) proficient in using emerging technologies and other mathematical tools; 
c) problem solvers, communicating mathematically, and working cooperatively; 
d) able to connect classroom experiences and real life situations; 
e) self-confident and value the importance and usefulness of mathematics. 
 
 
SUB-GOALS 
The curriculum framework outlined in this document, aims to have all students in The 
Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, 
patterns, ratios, and proportions. 
 
2. Estimate and understand the meaning, use, and connection between the four (4) basic 
operations; addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   8 
3. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and 
relationships in data, solve problems and predict results. 
 
4. Make and use appropriate measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and 
determine acceptable levels of accuracy. 
 
5. Demonstrate spatial sense and use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and 
draw conclusions about plane shapes and space figures. 
 
6. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and 
interpret uncertainty-using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these overarching goals and sub-goals, all students must have many and 
varied high-quality experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make 
conjectures, and test solutions to practical problems.

HOW TO USE THE CURRICULUM GUIDELINES 
 
Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. This Mathematics curriculum 
introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contributes to and serves as building blocks for 
other concepts across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematics strands 
that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at school, home, and even work 
settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to 
view, understand, and appreciate the relationships among mathematical skills and concepts. When 
students make connections and develop skills, their understanding deepens and expands. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into five content strands: Number and Operations, 
Algebra, Geometry & Spatial Sense, Measurement, and Statistics & Probability.  While each of the 
five strands deals with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from 
the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching Statistics, it is natural to ask questions 
that will require students to compute data presented in graphical form. 
 
Teachers are not expected to cover the content in the order the strands are presented in the scope and 
sequence. Instead, teachers are encouraged to use this curriculum guide to formulate a yearly plan in 
a manner that integrates the content of the strands in an effort to complete the annual learning goals 
for the particular grade level.  
 
Please note that The Scope of Work does not list every possible specific objective for the 
concepts/topics of each content strand. It provides a guide to the level of content, activities and 
resources that should be integrated at each grade level.

OVERVIEW OF CONTENT STRANDS 
 
The five content strands in this document are in line with those used by the National Council 
of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). For each of the content strands, the overarching goals 
and sub-goals are outlined in the objectives of the concepts/topics. 
 
Number and Operations: This content area focuses on students’ understanding the real 
number system, types of real numbers, and graphing real numbers. Proficiency with 
operating on whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and integers is emphasized. The 
relationship between fractions, decimals and percents; rounding, approximating and 
estimating are applied to real world situations. Students are also expected to recognize, 
describe, and extend special number patterns using arithmetic operations.  
 
Algebra: Algebra provides the tools through which one communicates in the language of 
mathematics. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts 
and ideas.  The Algebra strand develops students’ ability to recognize, represent, and solve 
problems involving relations, functions and equations. Students focus on constructing, 
evaluating and manipulating algebraic expressions, the distributive property and 
factorization, solving linear and quadratic equations, solving linear inequalities, systems of 
linear equations and inequalities.  Algebraic models are represented both symbolically and 
graphically.  Senior high students also study linear and quadratic functions, matrix algebra 
and differentiation. 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   12 
 
Geometry & Spatial Sense: Stresses the development of students' awareness of their 
physical environments through working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  Geometry 
is a natural content area for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills. 
They study attributes and angle properties of polygons, circles and compound shapes. 
Features prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones and spheres are used to solve real-world 
problems of compound three dimensional objects. Students identify and perform geometric 
transformations. Recognize both line and rotational symmetry. Additionally senior high 
students study trigonometry and vectors. Understanding geometric concepts is essential for 
students to make sense of measurement. 
 
Measurement: Students investigate concepts such as dimension, length, area, volume, 
capacity, time and temperature. They learn what attributes of a shape can be measured and 
how to measure by working with customary units and metric units. Students also become 
familiar with telling time using a twelve hour and twenty-four hour clock; and computing 
elapsed time.  This content strand highlights connections within mathematics and 
connections between mathematics and other subject areas, such as Social Studies, Religious 
Studies, Science, Music, Art, and Physical Education. 
 
Statistics and Probability: Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of 
data. The primary purpose of this strand is to develop students’ ability to organize and 
analyze data intelligently, and use probabilities to describe the likelihood of events 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   13 
occurring. While junior high school students determine probabilities for simple/single 
events, senior high school students should solve problems involving compound events. 
Students display statistical data in the form of tables and graphs. Venn diagrams and tree 
diagrams are used as visual aids to solve probability problems. Statistics and Probability are 
also linked to other content areas such as sets, number and operations, geometry, and 
algebra.

A fraction can be used to 
name a part of a whole or a 
part of a set of objects.  A 
fraction has a numerator 
and a denominator. 
 
The numerator, the top 
number in a fraction, tells 
how many equal parts are 
used 
 
The denominator, the 
bottom number in a 
fraction, tells the number 
of parts a whole is divided 
into or the size of each 
part. 
 
Note: the fraction bar 
means division. 
 
The denominator is the 
number of parts a whole is 
divided into. 
 
Proper fractions are less 
than one whole.

Improper fractions are fractions whose

Equivalent fractions are fractions that have 
the same value. 
 
A mixed number contains a whole number 
with a fraction. 
 
A fraction in lowest terms means the 
numerator and denominator have no factors in 
common. 
 
Fractions must be of the same kind (same 
denominator – use LCD to write equivalent 
fractions with common denominators) when 
placing in order and in order to compare the 
fractions. 
 
Fractions are simplified by dividing the 
numerator and denominator by the Highest 
Common Factor. The highest common factor 
is the largest number that evenly divides into 
the numerator and the denominator.

Equivalent ratios are two ratios 
that express the same relationship 
between numbers.  When ratios 
are equal, they are said to be

You can find equivalent ratios by

The Cartesian plane is formed 
using two perpendicular lines. 
The horizontal line is called the 
x-axis (with x-values) and the 
vertical line is called the y-axis 
(with y- values).  
 
The point of intersection of the 
axes is called the origin. 
 
Coordinates are used to locate 
position on the plane. They are 
written in the form (x, y). The 
coordinates (4, 3) indicates 
movement across the x-axis (4 
units to the right from the origin) 
followed by movement along the 
y-axis (3 units upwards).    
 
A line parallel to an axis is 
named according to the value on 
the alternate axis. 
 
The line y = 4 is the line drawn 
through the value 4 on the y-axis 
and is parallel to the x-axis.  
Each student draws a pattern and 
gives the coordinates to his 
partner to check to see the

Straight lines are 
usually just called lines. 
 
Curved lines are usually 
just called curves. 
 
Line Segment is the 
distance between two 
points. It represents 
length but not width. 
 
A ray has one endpoint. 
It goes on forever in one

the different 
types of angles: 
 Acute  
 Right 
 Obtuse 
 Straight 
 Reflex 
 Use 3 letters 
or single 
letter to 
name the 
angle such as 
B or <ABC. 
 
Use a protractor 
to draw and 
measure angles 
which are less 
than 180° in size. 
An angle measures the amount 
of turn between two lines that 
are at a point. 
 
Angles are measured in 
degrees. 
 
A protractor is used to 
measure angles. 
 
Acute angles are less than 90°. 
 
Obtuse angles are greater than 
90° but less than 180°. 
 
Right angles measure exactly 
90°. 
 
Straight angles measure 
exactly 180°. 
 
Reflex angles are greater than 
180°, but less than 360°. 
 
1. Give students coffee stirrers of 
straws and pipe cleaners to 
construct angles. 
 
Use the arms to show different 
sizes of angles. Teacher can 
demonstrate and ask questions 
like “Show me a 50°-degree 
angle” show me an angle that is 
less than 10 degrees. 
 
2. Instruct students to stand. As 
the teacher calls out a type of 
angle, the students should use 
their body parts to create the 
angles.   
 
Give each group of students a 
different picture. Students must 
identify and measure angles in the 
picture and compare answers.  
Use the same picture with all 
groups and rotate pictures, sharing 
answers with the group or with 
the class. Students discuss their 
findings and write results in their 
journals. Picture sources can be 
found in local newspapers or in 
free tourist brochures.

Find the length 
of the diameter 
given the radius 
and vice-versa. 
 
Construct 
circles of given 
radii and 
diameters using 
a pair of 
compasses. 
The diameter is a line segment that passes 
through the center of the circle and has its 
two endpoints on the circle. 
 
The radius only goes half across from the 
center to the circumference. 
 
Chord a line joining any two points on the 
circumference. 
 
An arc is any part of the circumference. 
 
A segment is the region bounded by a chord 
and an arc. 
 
A semicircle is the sector bounded by a 
diameter and half the circumference, i.e. a 
half circle. 
 
A sector is a region bounded by two radii 
and an arc. 
 
A tangent is a straight line that just touches 
the circumference of a circle at one point. 
 
Diameter: a line from one side of a circle to 
the other going through the center. Diameter 
is twice the radius. If the radius is 4cm- the 
diameter is 8 cm. if the D=12cm, then radius 
= 6 cm.  Note. The compasses must be opened 
to the length of the radius. 
Draw two circles of radii 4 
cm and 6 cm respectively, 
using the same center 
marked. Shade the area 
between the circumferences 
of the circle. 
 
Given that the diameter of a

CIRCLE cont’d 
Explain Pi as 
the ratio of a 
circle’s 
circumference 
to its diameter. 
 
 
 
 
 
Pi is a special name 
given to the ratio of 
a circumference to 
its diameter. Its 
value is always 
equal to 22/7 which 
as a decimal (3.14) 
goes on forever and 
has a special symbol 
(π)  
 
 
Have students bring in round flat objects 
(not oval). Put students in groups and 
have them measure and record the 
diameter, circumference and (C divided 
by D) of each object. Make a class chart 
of the entire C divided by D results in 
decimal form. The class should notice that 
all results are approximately 3.14.

Identify axes of 
symmetry in given 
shapes. 
 
 
A line of symmetry 
divides a shape into 
two identical parts. 
 
A shape has line 
symmetry if you can 
fold one half exactly 
on to the other. The 
fold line is the line of 
symmetry. One half is 
a mirror image or 
reflection of the other. 
 
A shape can have 
more than one line of 
symmetry. 
 
 
Use sheets of paper to cut 
out/fold shapes to determine 
lines of symmetry. 
 
How many lines of 
symmetry are in the 
following?

There are many 
different types of 
measurement, but we 
use the standard 
systems e.g. the British 
system which is called 
Imperial and is based 
on Inches, Pound and 
Pints or the French 
system which is called 
Metric. The base unit 
for length is Metres, 
weight/Mass Kilogram 
and capacity is Litre. 
 
Emphasis for our 
purpose will be on the 
Metric System. 
 
The Metric System is 
referred to as the 
decimal system. To 
convert units in the 
metric system we use 
powers of tens.

An infinite set has an infinite, i.e. 
unlimited number of elements.   
E.g. The set of whole numbers,  
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4...} is an infinite set. 
 
The number of elements in a 
finite set can be counted and 
written down as a number. 
 
E.g. The set {letters of the 
alphabet} is a finite set but the set 
{whole numbers} is not because 
it has an infinite number of 
elements. 
 
Equal sets have exactly the same 
number of members.   
If  X = {1, 2, 3},  Y = {c, a, b} 
therefore  X = Y. 
 
The empty set is the set with no 
members. It is denoted by the 
symbol  or {   }.

The arithmetic average or mean of a set of 
numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the 
number of figures in the set. 
 
The mode is the number that appears most often. 
 
The median is the middle number after the 
numbers have been placed in order.  
 
The range is the difference between the highest 
and the lowest number. 
 
A tally chart is a table with tally marks to show a 
valuable data set. Tally marks are frequencies, 
occurrences, or total numbers being measured for 
a specific category in a data set.

PROBABILITY 
Define probability. 
 
Define and explain the 
following terms 
associated with 
probability (certain, 
outcome, event, 
impossible, odds, 
likely, chance, 
independent, 
experiment, sample 
space, predict, 
unlikely, random, and 
dependent). 
 
Describe and calculate 
the probability of an 
independent event. 
 
Express probability 
with the notation 
P(event) = 
 
Probability is the measure of how likely an 
event is. It is often measured by a fraction, 
decimal or percentage. 
 
The probability of event A is written P (A).  
 
Probabilities are always numbers between 0 
and 1, inclusive. 
 
 
An experiment is a situation involving 
chance or probability that leads to results 
called outcomes. 
 
 
A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored 
yellow, blue, green, and red. 
What are the chances of landing on blue 
after spinning the spinner? 
e.g.  The experiment is spinning the spinner.

Odds: Away of representing the likelihood of an 
event's occurrence.    
 
A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of 
an experiment. 
 
Two events are independent if the occurrence of one 
does not change the probability of the other occurring.  
An example would be rolling a 2 on a die and flipping 
a head on a coin. Rolling the 2 does not affect the 
probability of flipping the head.  
 
If events are independent, then the probability of them 
both occurring is the product of the probabilities of 
each occurring. Therefore, to find the probability of 
two independent events, simply MULTIPLY the 
probabilities of the two events, and simplify the 
product. 
 
Specific Multiplication Rule 
Only valid for independent events  
 
P (A and B) = P(A) × P(B) 
 
Probability of events = 
 
P(event) =  number of favorable outcomes 
                     number of possible outcomes

quantity. 
  
Calculate 
percentage 
increase and

decrease. 
 
Solve word 
problems 
involving 
percentage 
increase and 
percentage 
decrease. 
Percent increase and percent decrease are 
measures of percent change, which is the 
extent to which a variable gains or loses 
intensity, magnitude, extent, or value. The 
figures are arrived at by comparing the initial 
(or before) and final (or after) quantities 
according to a specific formula. 
 
To calculate percentage increase, add the 
amount of the increase to 100% and find this 
new percentage of the given quantity.  
E.g. Increase $64.50 by 8%. 
 8 + 100 = 108% 
 
108
100 × 64.50 = $69.66    
 
Or  64.50 × 1.08 = $69.66 
 
To calculate percentage decrease, subtract 
the amount of the decrease from 100% and 
find this new percentage of the given 
quantity. 
E.g. Decrease $75 by 15%. 
100 −15 = 85% 
85
100 × 75 = $63.75    
 
Or   75 ∗0.85 = $63.75

Ask students to write a 
journal entry about what 
it means to have a percent 
less than 1 or a percent 
greater than 100. When 
does it not make sense to 
have a percent less than 1 
or greater than 100? Ask 
them to write down at 
least three things they 
think are the most 
important when solving 
problems involving 
percent. 
 
"Giving 110%" has 
become a fairly common 
expression. Have students 
explain why it's 
impossible. Then they 
should find other 
common, but 
mathematically-
impossible, expressions.

RATIO AND 
PROPORTION 
Use ratios to compare 
measurements with 
different units. 
 
Simply ratios with 
fractional terms. 
 
Write ratios in the 
form 1 : a or a : 1 
 
Share a quantity in a 
given ratio. 
 
Define the term 
proportion. 
 
Identify proportions. 
 
Solve proportions for 
missing terms 
 
Use proportions to 
find missing 
quantities. 
  
Share a quantity in a 
given ratio. 
 
To simplify ratios, divide all terms by the 
H. C. F. 
 
Units must be the same before simplifying.  
(Convert larger amount to smaller amount). 
𝐸𝑔.       5𝑚𝑚∶2 𝑐𝑚  (× 10) 
= 5𝑚𝑚∶20𝑚𝑚 
     = 1 ∶ 4 
 
Fractional terms must be multiplied by the 
L. C. M. in order to eliminate the 
denominator before simplifying. 
𝐸𝑔.  1
3 ∶ 3
4   (× 12) 
=  4 ∶9 
 
To share a quantity in a given ratio, divide 
the quantity by the total number of portions 
to find the value of one, and then multiply 
to find the value for each of the terms in 
the ratio. 
 
Example: Share $30 in the ratio 6:4 
6 + 4 = 10 (add the numbers in the ratio) 
30 ÷ 10 = 3 (divide to find each part) 
6 parts = 6 × 3 = $18 
4 parts = 4 × 3 = $12 
Check: $18 + $12 = $30 
Have students bring 
in grocery store items 
from home along 
with their prices. 
Express the size of 
the item as a ratio to 
its price. (e.g. 16 oz.: 
$3.58 for a bottle of 
Listerine) have 
students simplify the 
ratio. 
 
Often, we purchase 
items available in 
large and small sizes. 
Bring examples of 
these items with the 
cost per item. Work 
in pairs, have 
students determine 
which item is the 
better buy.

Calculate direct proportion 
using the fractional method. 
Use ratio and proportion to 
solve real life problems. 
 
If two varying quantities are directly 
proportional, they are always in the 
same ratio.  Divide the quantities to 
find the single unit. 
 
Example: 
If 2 ring pops cost 0.80¢, how much 
will 5 ring pops cost? 
2 ring pops cost 0.80¢ 
1 ring pop costs 0.80¢ ÷ 2 = 0.40¢ 
Therefore, 5 ring pops cost 5 ×0.40¢ 
= $2.00

POWERS 
Identifying the 
base and 
exponent in 
algebraic 
expressions. 
 
Rewriting 
expressions 
involving powers.  
Exponents are shorthand for 
repeated multiplication, just 
like multiplication is a 
shortened form of repeated 
addition.  The exponent tells 
how many times a number (the 
base) is used as a factor. 
 
For example, 25 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 
× 2  
 
2 is called the base and 5 is 
called the exponent.  
25 can be read as "2 raised to 
the fifth power" or "2 raise to 
the power 5" or "2 raised by the 
exponent of 5" or "2 to the 5". 
 
Rewrite the 
following using 
exponents. 
(a) 𝑎 𝑥 𝑎 𝑥 𝑎 
(b) 2𝑎 𝑥 3𝑎𝑏 𝑥

Adding a negative 
number has the same 
effect as subtracting 
the corresponding 
positive number. 
 
E.g. 
−4 + (-8) = −12

When integers have the same sign, add the integers.  
The sum will have the same sign as the integers. 
 
        + 7 +  +8 = +15                       
          -9 +  -4 = -13 
When integers have different signs, find the difference 
between the two numbers.  The sum will have the sign 
of the integer with the largest absolute value. 
        +8 + -5 = +3                             
         +4 + -9 = -5 
 
Subtracting a negative number has the same effect as 
adding the corresponding positive number.  When 
subtracting integers, the additive inverse must be used. 
The additive inverse of +8 is -8 (-8 + 8 = 0).  
 
-6 - (+8) = -6 + (-8) = -14 
 
Powers of integers 
1. The powers of an even exponent are always positive. 
That is: 
              (+)even  =    + 
             (−)even  =    + 
 
E.g.  
     (i)    22 = 2×2 =  4 
     (ii)    -22 = (-2)×(-2) =  4

RATIO, 
PROPORTION 
& RATE 
Direct and 
inverse 
proportion. 
 
Common 
measures of 
rate. 
 
Share in a given 
ratio. 
Two quantities are said to 
be in proportion when 
corresponding pairs of 
values are always in the 
same ratio.  Two quantities 
are said to be in direct 
proportion if they increase 
or decrease using a 
constant multiplier. 
When two quantities are 
related so that one quantity 
decreases as the other 
increases, one quantity is 
in inverse proportion to 
the other. 
Real life problems. 
 
Find out how to measure someone’s 
pulse, and then count how often their 
pulse beats in 30 seconds. 
 
How often does your own pulse beat in 1 
minute? Record this as a number of beats 
per minute. 
 
If you fold an A4 sheet of paper in half 
(the fold must be parallel to the shorter

figures. 
To estimate means to find 
an answer close to the 
exact value. When an exact 
value to a math problem is 
not needed, or when you 
want to check the 
reasonableness of an 
answer, you can use 
estimation.

Simplify an expression 
by removing the 
brackets (distributive 
property) and combining 
like terms – including 
integers. 
Sometimes brackets are used 
to hold two quantities 
together. Example:   
Multiply the sum of x and 3 
by 4 is written as 4(x + 3). 
All terms in the brackets are 
multiplied by the factor 4. 
4 x x + 4 x 3 = 4x + 12 
 
To simplify expressions with 
brackets, remove the 
brackets (expansion), then 
collect like terms to 
simplify.

TRANSPOSITION 
Change the 
subject of simple 
formula with no 
more than two 
operations and the 
subject appearing 
once only. 
The subject of the formula 
is the letter on its own on 
one side of the equal sign. 
 
To change the subject of a 
formula, solve it for the 
letter that is to be the new 
subject. Use inverse 
operations.

A closed circle means the number is included. 
 
Solving an inequality is finding the range of values of 
the unknown for which it is true. 
 
Inequalities are solved by using inverse operations.  
 
An inequality remains true when the same number is 
added to, or subtracted from, both sides. 
 
It remains true when both sides are multiplied or 
divided by the same positive number.

Use and 
interpret speed 
– time and 
distance-time 
graphs. 
In the 24-hour clock, there are no 
'a.m.' and 'p.m.' labels. 
The hours start at zero and go 
through to 23. 
All 24-hour clock times should be 
written hh:mm or hh:mm:ss, where 
h is the hour, m is the minute and s 
is the seconds. 
 
Converting from 24-hour to 12-
hour times 
 
Steps: 
 If the hour is exactly 12, then 
label it as a p.m. time. 
 If the hour is 00, change it to 12 
and label it as an a.m. time. 
 If the hour is greater than 12, 
then subtract 12 from the hour 
and label it as a p.m. time. 
 Otherwise, simply label it as an 
a.m. time and take away any 
leading zeros. 
 
The minutes and seconds never 
change when changing between 24-
hour and 12-hour times.

Converting from 12-hour to 24-hour clock 
 
Steps: 
 If the hour is exactly 12 p.m., then remove the 'p.m.' 
label. 
 If the hour is 12 a.m., then change it to 00. 
 If the hour is a p.m. time, then simply add 12 to the 
hour. 
 Otherwise, the hour does not change. If it is less 
than 10, then add a zero before the digit. 
The minutes and seconds never change when changing 
between 24-hour and 12-hour times. 
 
Examples: 
 
1:45am = 01:45     1:45pm = 13:45      4:20am = 04:20

These are usually straight-line graphs and starts 
from 00. 
 
When converting units e.g. gallons to litres, 
miles to kilometres and dollars to pounds the 
units are directly proportional to each other. 
Distance, Speed and Time Graph is used to 
show a journey or track a journey at different 
times. Reading the vertical and horizontal scale 
on the axis is very important. 
When no distance is travelling the graph shows 
a horizontal line between the movements. When 
travelling the steeper the line the faster the 
object is moving.

using proper set 
notation. 
 
 
Two sets are equivalent if the amount of elements 
in each set is equal. 
 
E.g.  A = {cat, mouse, dog} 
       B = {3,6,9} 
 
Sets A and B are equivalent because they both have 
three (3) elements. 
 
Two sets are equal if they have the same elements. 
 
E.g. L = {3, 5, 7, 9, 11} 
      M = { 11, 3, 9, 5, 7} 
 
Sets L and M are equal because the elements in 
both sets are the same. 
 
The complement of a set is the set of all the 
elements in the universal set that are not in the set 
in question. The symbol A' is used to represent the 
complement. 
 
E.g. U = {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15} 
      M = {3, 9, 15} 
Then Mˊ={5, 7, 11, 13}

PROBABILITY 
Compare and

and dependent 
events. 
Independent Events – Two events that do not 
affect each other. 
 
Dependent Events – Two events that do affect 
each other. 
 
Probability of Two Independent Events: 
Finding the probability of two independent 
events both occurring can be found by 
multiplying the probabilities of the two 
independent events. This can be expressed in the 
following equation: 
 
P (A and B) = P(A) × P(B) 
 
Event B is not affected by event A in any way in 
an independent event. 
 
Probability of Two Dependent Events: 
When the second probability event is affected by 
the first an adjustment must be made dictated by 
the effect. This occurs in the situation in which 
an item is drawn from a sample space and then 
not returned before the second event takes place. 
The affect in this situation is that there is one 
less item to select from on the second event

Whole Number: A number that indicates the number of whole objects. The coordinate of the origin or a point that is a whole number of 
units from the origin. 
Whole Numbers: The whole numbers are the numbers in the following never-ending sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, . . . 
X-axis: The horizontal axis of a rectangular coordinate plane. 
X-coordinate: The first number in an ordered pair indicating the horizontal distance of a point from the origin in the coordinate plane. 
X-intercept(s): The x coordinate(s) of the point(s) of intersection of a graph and the x-axis. 
Y-axis: The vertical axis of a rectangular coordinate plane. 
Y-coordinate: The second number in an ordered pair indicating the vertical distance of a point from the origin in the coordinate plane. 
Y-intercept: The point of intersection of a graph with the y-axis. 
Zero-Dimensional (0D): No measurable extent or attribute. A point is zero dimensional because it only specifies a location.  
Zero power: For any nonzero number x, x0 = 1. 
Zeros of a Quadratic Function: See Roots of a Quadratic Equation.
