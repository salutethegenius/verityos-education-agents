INDUSTRY PARTNERS RECOMMENDATIONS 
• “Soft Skills” such as work ethics, attire, grooming, communication skills and 
quality customer service principles should be stressed in ALL areas of 
Hospitality & Tourism Studies. In areas where practical skills are the 
primary focus of instruction, teachers should remember that lodging 
establishments usually train their workers in their work performance 
requirements. However, it is the soft skills that create the most challenges 
and sometimes result in dismissals. 
 
• Students in this programme of study should also include the following 
subjects in their course selection where possible:  
➢ Geography and/or History 
➢ Spanish and /or French 


viii 
 
➢ Computer Studies. 
• Teachers should utilize the expertise of industry partners in as many ways as 
possible. They can be called on to give presentations in the classroom or to 
arrange on-site familiarization trips.  
• Hotels that have adopted a school are only too willing to give their support. 
 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
HOSPITALITY & TOURISM INDUSTRY 
The Department of Education acknowledges that it cannot operate in a vacuum. In 
order for students and teachers within our Hospitality and Tourism Studies (HTS) 
to be successful, it is necessary for both students and teachers to participate in on-
going training outside of the traditional classroom. It will be necessary for our 
students to tour cruise ships, private yachts, hotels, etc. to obtain real world 
experience in the field of Hospitality and Tourism Studies. In the event that a hotel 
property sees the need to upgrade its facilities, it would be mutually beneficial for 
that property to donate suitable items to HTS programmes so that these HTS labs 
will closely mimic the property infrastructure. 
 
OVERARCHING GOALS: 
This Hospitality and Tourism Studies curriculum is a three year course, which offers 
instruction for students whether they are seeking immediate entry-level 
employment in the tourism industry, continuing studies at a tertiary institution, or 
pursuing an entrepreneurial undertaking. 
 
Instruction is foundational. Students will be exposed to six core competencies 
namely: Professionalism, Effective Communication, Providing Quality Customer 
Service, Personal and Guest Safety, Tourism Promotion and Environmental 
Consciousness required in the industry. These core competencies are integrated in 
the study of Tourism, Accommodations (Front Office and Housekeeping), Food & 
Beverage Service and Food Preparation. The curriculum is designed to provide 
realistic learning experiences. Teaching strategies will include practical and 
theoretical experiences within the classroom environment. 
 
Learning through research and industry internship will enhance regular classroom 
experiences. 


ix 
 
GENERAL OBJECTIVES: 
• 
Develop an awareness of the eight tourism sectors and their roles in the       
       national economy; 
• 
Acquire knowledge and experiences relative to tourism, which would   
        create an interest in the extensive career options that exist within the   
         industry; 
• 
Participate in practical experiences through instructional programs and  
       industry internships and 
• 
Appreciate the tourism product in The Bahamas and develop “soft skills”  
       which will promote exceptional performance at industry standards. 
 
 
HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM STUDIES PATHWAY PROGRAMMES: 
       
In order to effectively implement this Family and Consumer Science Education Unit 
Curriculum in a school, special consideration must be given to the allocation of hours 
for each of these four (4) subjects (i.e. Tourism Studies, Accommodations, Food 
Preparation, along with Food & Beverage Service) to be taught within the school’s 
timetable. A sample programme pathway is shown in the table below. A complement 
of two to five Hospitality & Tourism Studies Teachers would be needed depending on 
the number of students enrolled in this programme.
