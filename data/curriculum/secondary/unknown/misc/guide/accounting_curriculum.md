ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
As we seek to prepare globally competitive and productive citizens, such preparation must be 
guided by consistent, relevant and critically challenging content. It was with this mandate that 
the initial design of documents in the Business Studies area were completed under the 
leadership of Ms. Faye Bascom, the Education Officer responsible for Business Studies at that 
time. Revision efforts commenced several years ago under the guidance of Mrs. Keyshan 
Bastian who preceded Ms. Bascom and would not have been possible without the commitment 
and collaborative efforts of many individuals and organizations.  
Appreciation is extended to the Teachers, and Subject Coordinators of the Business Studies 
Section, Department of Education and Private School Partners, the Curriculum and Examination 
& Assessment officers within the Department of Education, representatives from the School of 
Business at The College of The Bahamas and The Bahamas Financial Services Board, 
respectively. Additionally, sincerest gratitude is extended to all other stakeholders that may 
have in some way contributed to the completion of this document, in an effort to ensure that 
students are competent, confident and ready to embrace life after their high school experience.   
 
OVERVIEW OF THE SUBJECT - ACCOUNTING 
Accounting is viewed as the lifeline of business, as it would prove challenging to identify 
individuals, households or firms that are not continuously and consistently impacted by 
accounting principles.  It is this accounting knowledge that equips people to make informed 
decisions relative to the allocation of resources and determine, with reasonable predictions, 
returns on investments.  This course introduces Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(GAAP) and procedures for multiple business units using double entry accounting. It places 
attention on both manual and automated accounting processes, utilizing appropriate 
accounting software as a means to introduce students to industry standards and expectations.  
Students will be expected to analyze and record business transactions and allow these to 
inform the preparation, analysis and interpretation of financial reports. They will be expected 
to apply the knowledge gained to evaluate accounting information and allow it to inform their 
daily lives and future career undertakings. Instructional strategies may include the use of 
Technology, integrated projects, simulated activities and life experiences.   
 
GENERAL COURSE OBJECTIVES 
STUDENTS WILL UNDERSTAND: 
 Basic rules and procedures in the field of accounting that govern all companies. 
 The application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in maintaining the balance of

INDUSTRY PARTNERS RECOMMENDATIONS 
The feedback from external stakeholders was not as readily forthcoming as we had hoped, but 
the few persons who committed some time and energy to reviewing the document, highlighted 
the following:  
 
Recommendation  
The content covered in this area needs to be reduced as it is felt that there is too much depth at 
the secondary level. It was the opinion of a few stakeholders that the span of coverage does not 
allow sufficient time and focus on each area, some of which are addressed at the tertiary level.  
Response  
In response to this concern the content was aligned to address tertiary and employment needs 
through reducing the span of focus with parallel opportunity for practical application. 
 
Recommendation  
There should be additional teacher training / retraining programmes to ensure that teachers 
are abreast of current trends and industry practices. 
Response  
Professional development is ongoing, providing relevant and rigorous activities to ensure for the 
growth and development of our educators. Stakeholders were welcomed to be active participants 
in our ongoing professional development and support initiatives as resources, human and 
otherwise would permit. 
 
Recommendation  
Even though not always a front of the house position, entry level employment in this area 
requires some attention to the development of soft skills which enhance the work environment 
and presentation of the potential employee. Included in this is work ethics, dress and grooming, 
deportment, consistent quality, customer service and attention to formal communication, both 
oral and written.  
Response  
The document seeks to integrate interpersonal skills throughout the grade levels, promoting 
communication development and the ability to demonstrate comprehension verbally. 
 
Recommendation  
Business students should, in addition to an area of specialization, study a foreign language and 
basic computer studies. 
 
 


Accounting  
 
 
 
 
 
 
vii
Response 
This is an agreed recommendation which is factored into the management of our programme 
structure at the high school level. 
 
Recommendation  
Industry partners should be viewed as stakeholders and potential partners in the teaching/learning 
process and not merely donors who have the financial capacity to provide physical resources.  
Response 
 
Our intensions in this area are consistent with industry. Extensive invitations seeking professional 
contributions and assistance will continue with the hope that such will be given consistent attention 
and commitment to ensure the satisfaction of academic and labour market needs. Collaborative 
efforts are appreciated and will continue. 
 
OVERARCHING GOALS: 
Identify, Interpret and Evaluate Accounting Practices & Procedures 
In an effort to ensure a holistic accounting perspective, students will be exposed to a multifaceted 
content base including fundamental accounting for business, the accounting cycle, accounting 
processes, financial statements, careers, ethics & decision making.  
Analyze Financial Data  
The focus of the accounting curriculum is to ensure that having completed a three year course of 
study, students will be exposed to fundamental accounting procedures and practices, equipping 
them to analyze financial transactions and information, apply specific knowledge, critically evaluate 
appropriate options and make informed decisions.  
Demonstrate Technical Competence & Communicate Confidently 
Students will be expected to demonstrate technical competence in fundamental accounting 
procedures and practices, while also confidently communicating findings, using appropriate jargon 
and statistical references. 
Evaluate Professional Obligations, Careers & Industry Expectations 
Students will acquire an appreciation for industry’s expectations and standards that govern 
accounting professionals from entry level to senior management. They will be sensitized to dress, 
grooming, formal vs informal communication, the appropriate use of technology in the workplace, 
general workplace ethics and various confidentiality expectations. 
 
GENERAL OBJECTIVES: 
 Develop an awareness of entry level employment accounting practices and the implications of 
these on individual, corporate and economic platforms.  
 Acquire specific knowledge and experiences relative to financial management that would 
create an interest in and desire to explore the vast career opportunities in the field of accounting, 
within every facet of the economy.  
 Participate in practical experiences through instructional programs and industry internships.
