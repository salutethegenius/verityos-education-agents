ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
As we seek to prepare globally competitive and productive citizens, such preparation must be 
guided by consistent, relevant and critically challenging content. It was with this mandate that 
the initial design of documents in the Business Studies area were completed under the 
leadership of Ms. Faye Bascom, the Education Officer responsible for Business Studies at that 
time. Revision efforts commenced several years ago under the guidance of Mrs. Keyshan 
Bastian who preceded Ms. Bascom and would not have been possible without the commitment 
and collaborative efforts of many individuals and organizations. 
 
Appreciation is extended to the teachers, and Subject Coordinators of the Business Studies 
Section, Department of Education and Private School Partners, the Curriculum and Examination 
& Assessment Officers within the Department of Education, representatives from the School of 
Business at the University of The Bahamas and The Bahamas Chamber of Commerce and 
Employers’ Confederation, respectively. Additionally, sincerest gratitude is extended to all other 
stakeholders that may have in some way contributed to the completion of this document, in an 
effort to ensure that students are competent, confident and ready to embrace life after their 
high school experience. 
 
OVERVIEW OF THE SUBJECT 
 
Commerce and banking serves to address a primary need to ensure that students in Business 
programmes are exposed to current trends and practices that have significant implications for 
the Hospitality and Tourism, Financial Services and general commercial environment in the 
country. Commerce addresses the commercial activity that drives the supply and consumption 
of goods and services. Banking seeks to address access to finances and the relevant financial 
services required by participants in commercial activity. It simply seeks to take goods from a 
point of production to a point of consumption and the multifaceted prerequisites to ensure 
that this fundamental need is addressed. This course of study will expose students to important 
commerce and banking concepts and principles, which should adequately prepare them for 
tertiary studies or entry level employment opportunities. 
 
GENERAL COURSE OBJECTIVES 
 
STUDENTS WILL UNDERSTAND: 
 
• 
Basic commercial and banking principles and practices.
