INTRODUCTION 
 
SCIENCE CURRICULA 2019 REVISED EDITIONS 
The 1982 editions of the General Science and Health Science Curricula were designed to ensure teachers were provided with guidelines to impart common science information. The 
revised General Science Curriculum 1997 sought to introduce some knowledge of scientific practicals (scientific method and apparatus) as well as Caribbean Scientists and their work in 
a strand entitled “Science and Me”. 
  In 2010, the General Science and Health Science Curricula were revised along with Biology and Physics Curricula developed. Their focus, as was that of the 2012 Chemistry and 
Combined Science Curricula developed, was on students developing scientific processing skills that are transferrable to everyday living. Learner outcomes were worded to ensure skills 
were being developed in an intentional manner. Additionally, the curricula required teachers to use alternative methods of assessment to assess students’ knowledge, understanding and 
skills proficiency. These methods included students’ oral, visual, musical and dramatic presentations, ICT publications as well as designing investigations. It was also recommended that 
teachers employ a form of “flipped classroom” when appropriate, allowing students to conduct their individual “research” or literature review as well as much of the collaboration in 
group projects to be done outside of lesson time.  
The 2019 curricula seek to provide the learning environment in which students are moved from “learning about science” to “exploring science”. This means, in part, that they are 
creating their learning from their experiences. This lofty goal is based on five pillars extracted from documents reviewed. They are: 
 Science concepts – Minister Lloyd’s Budget Speech 2017, Comparative Analyses of curricula of four territories, Profile of a 21st Century High School Graduate in The Bahamas, 
Public Perception Questionnaires, Shared Vision for Education 2030, UN Sustainable Development Goals (6) 
 Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication and Creativity – 21st Century Learning Skills, Comparative Analyses, Profile of a 21st Century High School Graduate in 
The Bahamas 
 Innovation - Minister Lloyd’s Budget Speech 2017 emphasis on Science, Technology & Innovation; Profile of a 21st Century High School Graduate in The Bahamas, 
 Links between Science and other disciplines, society and the environment - Minister Lloyd’s Budget Speech 2017, Comparative Analyses, Profile of a 21st Century High School 
Graduate, STREAM Education in OAS Training 2018  
 Responsibility (scientific values, attitudes & habits of mind) - Comparative Analyses, Profile of a 21st Century High School Graduate in The Bahamas  
 
 Key science concepts with local examples and applications along with the inclusion of contemporary, high interest topics are included. 
The 2010 & 2012 curricula included development of Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication and Creativity in the skills highlighted. The same is true for the 2019 curricula, 
and in some cases, with greater emphasis. Similarly, the 2010 & 2012 curricula included “uses scientific and technological principles to make products” as a skill. In the 2019 curricula, 
students’ recognition and use of the relationships among science, technology, innovation, society and the environment are highlighted.  
Students’ use of visual and performing arts, ICT applications, mathematical concepts and skills to perform recommended activities as well as their inclusion in alternative methods of 
assessment in the 2010 & 2012 curricula, are continued in the 2019 curricula. The introduction of STREAM Education in the 2019 curricula will strengthen students’ transference of 
knowledge and skills among disciplines. As a result, it is expected that students’ will develop a holistic concept of education (their learning) rather than compartmentalizing it with an 
end result of greater learning. 
 
The new “pillar” of the 2019 curricula is students developing scientific attitudes, values and habits of mind. Those identified are: Curiosity, Skepticism, Positive attitude to failure, 
Tolerance of other’s views, Open to new ideas, Cooperation, Daring to try, Perseverance, Flexibility/adaptability, Questioning and Posing Problems, Applying Past Knowledge to New 


 
5
Situations, Taking Responsible Risks, Thinking Independently, Remaining Open to Continuous Learning, Develop analytical thinking and practical problem solving techniques, 
Generate new ideas explaining everyday technological applications of science; evaluating associated personal, social, economic and environmental implications and making decisions 
based on the evaluation of evidence and arguments.  
 
In short, the 2019 curricula focus on student activities and teachers’ methods of instruction that will foster students’ peaked interest and curiosity to pursue further knowledge about the 
content. 
 
 
Introduction to the PHYSICS CURRICULUM 
 
Students, who have obtained Grades A - C in BJC Examinations inclusive of General Science and Mathematics and are desirous of pursuing science studies at the tertiary level, will 
begin the three-year course of study that is outlined in the Physics Curriculum 2019, in Grade 10. 
 
The science concepts/content, student activities and methods of instruction in the curriculum are intended to challenge and prepare more able students with an interest in science for 
tertiary studies. It is therefore important that the curriculum assists students in taking responsibility for their learning and performance. In addition to completing curricular projects 
(including STREAM and robotics) students will be encouraged to participate in science competitions, as well as mentoring programmes that that support the curriculum as they may 
become available.  
 
The Scope and Sequence Content is a matrix which outlines the topics (content) and depth (scope) as well as the order (sequence) in which they are taught. This matrix is useful for quick 
reference. By contrast, the Scope of Work is the section of the Curriculum which provides detailed guidance for the teachers to plan their lessons. Each grade level in the Scope of Work 
was designed to be completed in 27 teaching weeks (most schools have 3- 50 minute periods).  
 
It is important to note that the Physics Curriculum 2019 to a great extent, retains the information in the Physics Curriculum 2010 with revisions made. This attests to the quality of work 
done by the writers of that document namely: Susan Allie, Vernal Brathwaite, Arlec Farley and Sharon Stuart.  
 
The Scope and Sequence Content table outlines the topics to be covered, the depth and the order in which they will be taught. In the 2010 Curriculum, the topics appeared almost in a 
linear format where a major topic was taught completely before another followed. This modular format, while fashioned on the BGCSE Syllabus, is more appropriate for educational 
systems where high school students study a major topic as a course for one semester. Their final assessment for that course is also done in the semester. There is no further assessment on 
that course. However, in the educational system in The Bahamas, there is a final assessment at the end of the third year of studying a subject. Hence, the 2019 Scope and Sequence 
Content table shows topics shows eleven (11) strands (major/overarching topics) which have related topics/sub-topics spread over the three-year period. This arrangement not only 
supports the document being a spiral curriculum but assists students in preparing for a final examination based on three-years’ work. Teachers outside the public school system who find 
it difficult to follow the new format may use the modular approach.

(i) 
Deletions 
To avoid isolated learning and to provide adequate time for students to complete the curriculum using a skilled based approach, the following deletions have been made: 
• 
Bernouille’s principle and its applications 
• 
Galvanometers  
 
(ii) 
Modifications 
The Physics content has been re-sequenced into 11 strands or major topics, aspects of each will be progressively gleaned by students over the three year period in an effort to 
allow students to sequentially build on prior knowledge after the requisite or foundational understanding of concepts have been assimilated. To this end, topics that require 
significant critical thinking and problem solving are appropriately sequenced to allow students to become more and more adept at analysis and problem solving.

METHOD OF 
ASSESSMENT 
• Interpret scales on 
measuring instruments.  
 
• Use appropriate instruments 
to measure quantities to 
degree of accuracy and 
precision allowed by the 
instrument. Rulers, 
measuring cylinder, stop 
watches, clock, 
thermometer, triple beam 
balance, digital balance, 
spring balance, Vernier 
caliper, micrometer screw 
gauge, ammeter, voltmeter. 
 
 
• Tabulate measurements with 
appropriate column/ row 
headings (physical quantity, 
units).  
 
 
A scale consists of a zero and marked divisions that 
enable us to measure a physical quantity.  A linear 
scale is one in which the divisions are equal.  An 
example of a linear scale is the scale on a ruler.  The 
scale divisions are equally spaced.  Not all scales are 
linear, however.  In this course, we shall be using 
mainly instruments with linear scales.  
 
The cm rule (or metre rule) 
The scale on this rule starts from a zero.  (Make sure 
students identify the zero mark.)  Each cm is divided 
into 10 equal divisions.  Thus, each of these small 
divisions is 0.1 cm. 
 
Precision of a measurement 
The precision of an instrument is the smallest sub-
division on the instrument.  Thus, the precision of the 
cm rule is 0.1 cm.  
 
Table headings should contain the physical quantity 
being measured (e.g length), the quantity symbol (L) 
and the unit in which the quantity is being measured 
(cm).  Notice the slash (called a solidus) between the 
quantity symbol and the unit symbol. 
Note: Either the bracket or the solidus could be     
          used, but there is a need to be consistent.

Express numbers in a 
measurement to given 
significant figures. 
 
Significant figures and precision 
When recording a measurement, careful attention 
should be paid to instrument precision.  Measurements 
on the cm rule are made to the nearest 0.1 cm.  Thus, 
readings in cm should be recorded to one decimal 
place such as 4.6 cm or  
9.0 cm, but not 9 cm or 9.00 cm. 
 
The number of figures in a reading, starting from the 
first non-zero digit to the last digit (zero or non-zero) 
are called significant figures in a measurement. The 
three rules for determining how many significant 
figures are in a number are: 
1. Non-zero digits are always significant. 
2. Any zeros between two significant digits are 
significant. 
3. A final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal 
portion ONLY are significant. 
 
Rules for using significant figures with measured 
values 
1.  Addition and subtraction rule 
     The answer takes the least number of decimal  
      places.  Thus, 4.6 + 2.02  =  6.6, and not 6.62.   
      Also, 4.6 + 2.87  =  7.5, and not 7.47. 
2.  Multiplication and division rule    
The answer takes the least number of significant 
figures.  Thus, 2.87 x 4.3  =  12, and not 12.341. 
Calculations 
 
Using the cm ruler (or metre rule) 
 
1. The object being measured (the 
dollar in this case) is as close as 
possible to the scale on the rule; 
2. One end of the object is against the 
zero mark on the scale; 
3. Their eyes are directly above the 
point on the object and the scale 
mark when taking a reading (this 
reduces the error of parallax in the 
reading – see, for example, Physics 
for CSEC, by Farley and Trotz); 
and 
4. Take several readings each of the 
length and width, at various 
positions just in case the dollar is 
not uniform.

The International System (S.I.) 
Fundamental quantities and units 
In the International System, all physical quantities are 
based on a small set of physical quantities called 
fundamental or base quantities.  Seven of these base 
quantities are listed below, together with their unit 
names and unit symbols. 
 
(Note the rule for writing unit names and unit symbols:  
All unit names are written with common letters, 
whether named after a person or not.  Unit symbols 
begin with a capital letter only if the unit is named after 
a person.)

Derived quantities and units 
Speed is distance (length) divided by time.  Speed is 
called a derived quantity, since it is a combination of 
two base quantities (length and time).  The S.I. unit for 
speed is metres per second (m/s). 
 
Most of the quantities to be used in this course will be 
derived quantities.  Some of them are named after 
scientists.  For example, force is a combination of 
mass, length and time.  The S.I. unit symbol for force is 
kg.m/s2.  This unit for force is called a newton (N). 
Suggested activities include 
measuring the following: 
-   the length of the room 
-   the mass of a student (using a 
bathroom scale;  if the scale is 
in lb, note that 1 kg  =  2.2 lb) 
-   the time taken for the teacher to 
do a certain walk (e.g. the 
teacher actually walks from 
one corner to another in the 
room) 
-   the temperature of this room in 
degrees Celsius and in kelvin

Convert between units.  
 
Conversions 
Frequently we need to convert a multiple or a sub-
multiple unit to a S.I. unit.  This is usually because the 
S.I. is a coherent system – if we work problems in S.I., 
the answer automatically turns out in S.I.  Furthermore, 
physical constants that we need in our calculations are 
usually given in S.I. units. 
 
Here two typical examples of conversions.  These 
conversions involve the following prefixes:

Example 1 
Convert 24.3 cm to m. 
Solution:  cm  =  c x m  (just like ab  =  a x b) 
Therefore, 24.3 cm  =  24.3 x 0.01 x m                              
                                 =  0.243 m 
 
Example 2  
Convert 24.3 g to kg. 
Solution:  to “multiply by 1”.  Since we are interested 
in kg, we choose 1 = kg/kg.   
24.3 g  =  24.3 g  x  kg   =  24.3 kg  =  24.3 kg

Construct and interpret force 
diagrams. 
Determine the resultant of 
forces. 
Sketching Forces Acting On Objects 
Students should be made aware of the 
following: 
• The weight of an object always acts 
vertically downward. 
• When an object presses against a surface, 
the surface presses back on the object 
with a normal contact force. 
• The force of tension along a tight string 
acts along the string and points away from 
the object to which the string is attached. 
• The force of friction on an object acts 
opposite to the direction of motion of the 
object as the object rubs against another 
object. 
Resultant 
The resultant of two (or more) forces is the 
single force that has the same effect as the 
other forces combined. 
If the resultant of forces on an object is not 
zero, the object will move (accelerate), 
because there is a net force. 
If the resultant of forces on an object is 
zero, the object will either not move, or 
move with zero acceleration (i.e. move at 
constant speed). 
3 Sketching Forces Acting On Objects 
Students identify and sketch the forces on 
the following: 
• A book resting on a horizontal surface. 
• A box being pulled horizontally along 
a rough floor by a cord inclined at an 
acute angle to the horizontal. 
• A box sliding down a rough inclined 
plane. 
• A basketballer moving upwards in the 
air. 
• A pendulum bob when the string is at 
the maximum angle. 
4 Resultant of parallel forces 
 
Students exert parallel forces, P and Q, 
on a block (using spring balances to 
measure the forces) to just barely move 
the block. Then they exert a single force, 
F, to just barely move the block. 
The following resources

FRICTION AND DRAG 
• Demonstrate that an object 
falling through a fluid 
achieves terminal velocity. 
Friction 
One of the factors that contributes to 
inefficiency in machines is the force of 
friction due to solid parts rubbing against 
each other. An activity to measure frictional 
force is given under Physical Measurements 
and Units, Topic 4 : Usin Other Measuring 
Instruments, Activity 6. 
Drag 
Drag is a force, like friction, that opposes 
motion. Drag is experienced when an object 
moves through a fluid (e.g. a boat moving 
through water, or a plane moving through 
the air). Drag increases with speed, and 
therefore, when an object falls through a 
fluid, it reaches a constant speed (called 
terminal speed) when the force of drag is 
equal to the force of gravity (we neglect the 
upthrust force for a small object). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Drag 
Students design and conduct an 
investigation to determine the terminal 
velocity of a small ball bearing falling 
through two different types or grades of 
oil in a measuring cylinder. 
Students can also investigate how 
terminal velocity varies with area of

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
The study of the motion of 
objects and the related concepts 
of force and energy is called 
mechanics.  
Mechanics is often divided into 
two sections: kinematics, which 
describes how objects move and 
dynamics, which deals with 
forces and their relation 
primarily to the motion  
. 
 
 
1 REFERENCE FRAMES 
AND DISPLACEMENT 
• Measurements of 
position, distance or 
speed are always made 
with respect to a 
reference frame. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reference Frames 
 
For example, a train is travelling at 50 km/h with a 
man walking at 5 km/h towards the front. This 5 
km/h is the man’s speed with respect to the train as 
the frame of reference. With respect to the ground 
the man’s speed is 50 km/h + 5 km/h = 55 km/h. It 
is always important to specify frame of reference 
when referring to a person’s speed. In everyday life 
the earth is usually the frame of reference. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Coordinate Axes 
In Physics we use the coordinate 
axes to represent a frame of 
reference.

2  POSITION. DISTANCE 
AND DISPLACEMENT 
• distinguish between position 
and displacement 
 
Position, distance and displacement 
For one-dimensional motion the position of an 
object is given by its x-coordinate (or the y-
coordinate if its motion is vertical). 
 
The distinction between distance and displacement 
can be illustrated as follows: 
 
Imagine a person walking 70 m East then turning 
around and walking 30 m West. The total distance 
travelled is 100 m, but the displacement is only 40 
m from the starting point. 
Thus, displacement is the change in position of an 
object or how far the object is from its starting 
position. 
Displacement is a vector quantity and can be 
represented by arrows in diagrams. In the above 
example the blue arrow represents the displacement 
vector, whose magnitude is 40 m and whose 
direction is to the right. 
Displacement uses the symbol ∆x. 
∆x = x2 -x1 (final position – initial position)

Students move an object (e.g. an 
eraser) along the edge of a desk 
from A →B→C.   
They measure: 
(i)  the distance travelled to the 
nearest cm 
(ii)  the displacement (magnitude 
and direction – for direction, they 
measure the angle θ and state the 
direction in degrees clockwise 
from the direction AB).

Note: 
Teachers are encouraged to insist 
on correct terminology in 
definitions in these very early 
lessons.  This will help set the 
stage for straight thinking.  
“Definitions” like:  ‘speed is how 
fast something is going’, or 
‘distance is how far something has 
travelled’, should be discouraged.

INTERPRETING TICKER 
TAPE CHARTS 
• interpret ticker tape charts to

instantaneous speed, constant

Average speed is the total distance divided 
by the time elasped.   
The S.I. unit symbol for speed is m/s, since 
speed is a distance (i.e. a length) divided 
by a time.  
The speedometer in motor vehicles 
measure your instantaneous speed either in 
miles per hour (mph) or kilometers per 
hour (km/h). 
Speed is a positive quantity with units and 
is therefore a scalar quantity. 
 
Velocity is used to tell us the magnitude 
(how fast the object is moving) as well as 
its direction and is therefore a vector 
quantity. 
 
Average velocity = displacement/ time    
                                                      Elapsed 
 
Instantaneous velocity is the average 
velocity during a very very small time 
interval 
Instantaneous speed is simply the 
magnitude of the instantaneous velocity 
2 Determining average speed and 
   average velocity 
Let students measure the time taken for 
the small object to be moved from A to C.  
They then calculate the following: 
(i)  the average speed of the trip 
A→B→C; 
(ii)  the average velocity of the trip 
A→B→C (they must state the magnitude 
and direction of the velocity). 
 
3 Demonstration/discussion 
The teacher walks around the perimeter of 
the classroom, returning to his/her starting 
position and asks students to time the 
walk. 
Students are challenged to determine 
(i)  the distance walked 
(ii)  the displacement 
(iii) the average speed 
(iv) the average velocity

of change of velocity.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acceleration 
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity 
with time. Acceleration is always in the 
direction of the net force acting on an object.  
Acceleration is a vector quantity. 
 
Acceleration  =  change in velocity / time    
 
In equation form,  a  =  v2  -  v1 
                                        t2-t1 
When t1=0, t2-t1 simply becomes t. 
The S.I. unit for acceleration is (m/s)/s or 
m/s2. 
The equation a  =  (v2  -  v1)/t  can be 
rewritten as  
v2  =  v1  +  at  by a simple change of subject. 
 
Note that acceleration tells us velocity 
changes with time whereas velocity tells us 
how position changes with time. 
 
Also, when acceleration and velocity have 
the same sign, the speed of the object 
increases. 
 
Conversely, when acceleration and velocity 
have opposite signs, the speed of the object 
decreases. 
1 Demonstrating acceleration 
A low-friction cart or a ball can be given an 
initial push along a horizontal board and then 
on the board inclined at about a 30o angle. 
 
2  Calculating acceleration 
 
a = 
(5.0−15.0) 𝑚/𝑠
5.0 𝑠
          
 
                        = -2.0 m/s2 
 
a = 
(−5.0− −15.0}𝑚/𝑠
5.0 𝑠
 
                      = + 2.0 m/s2 
When an object slows down it is decelerating, 
but deceleration doesn’t mean that the 
acceleration is negative.

• Investigate factors which 
affect the moment (turning 
effect) of forces. 
 
• Describe and identify force 
couples. 
 
Moment 
The moment, M, of a force, F, 
about an axis is the product of 
the force and the perpendicular 
distance, d, from the axis to the 
line of action of the force. 
Thus, 
M = F d. 
A moment produces a turning 
effect (rotation) about an axis. 
The rotation could be clockwise 
or anti-clockwise. Moment is 
sometimes called torque. 
 
1 Calculating moments 
Students calculate moments in the two types of 
situations shown below: 
 
Note: In the second case, students use the 
perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of 
action of the force. 
2 Investigating factors affecting moment 
1. Place a metre rule on a pivot (e.g. the side of a pencil) 
so that the ruler balances (approximately). Note the 
balance point and use this pivot at this point 
throughout the experiment. 
2.   Place a 100-g mass on the ruler at a distance of 20.0 
cm from the pivot. The ruler becomes 
overbalanced. 
3.   Attempt balancing the ruler using 
- a smaller mass (e.g. 50 g) 
- a larger mass (e.g. 200 g) 
Ask students how enough moment is obtained to 
balance the ruler using (1) a smaller mass and (2) a 
larger mass (with the 100-g mass at a given position) 
In other words: what are the factors affecting moment?

Factors affecting pressure in fluids 
 
Pressure in fluids can be investigated using 
a manometer.  The manometer consists of 
a thistle funnel, T, with a sheet of rubber 
stretched over its mouth and secured with a 
rubber band.  The stem of the thistle funnel 
is connected to a flexible tubing which, in 
turn, is connected to a U-tube containing 
water.  (See diagram below.) 
 
The pressure of the liquid at the surface of 
the rubber sheet over the mouth of the 
thistle funnel (i.e. the pressure at a depth, 
d, in the liquid) is equal to the pressure of 
the air trapped in the manometer.   
Investigating factors affecting 
pressure in fluids 
 
- Students investigate the variation of 
pressure, P, with depth, d, using the 
water manometer.  (Note: the U-tube 
must be adjusted so that the level at P is 
the same as the level at T.) 
 
- Using other fluids of known density 
(e.g. oil or salt water) in the fluid 
container, students investigate the 
variation of fluid pressure, P, with 
density of the fluid.  
 
(In both of the above examples, discuss 
control of variables.  For example, in the 
first investigation, the kind of liquid and 
temperature are kept constant; in the 
second example, the depth and 
temperature are kept constant.)

By keeping the depth constant, and 
swiveling T in various directions, 
students investigate if the fluid pressure 
varies with direction within the fluid.  A 
thistle funnel with a straight glass tube, 
or with a U-tube, can also be used to 
point in the downward or upward 
direction at the depth, d. 
 
Investigation of liquid level 
 
The teacher sets up the apparatus shown 
on right in which the liquid in all the 
tubes is exposed to atmospheric pressure.  
The fact that all surfaces exposed to the 
atmosphere are at the same height shows 
that the pressure at their bases depend 
only on vertical height and not on shape 
or size of tube or area of base.

Applications 
-  Dams are built thicker and stronger at 
their bases because the pressure of the 
water increases with depth. 
 
- Siphons work as follows: 
  The pressure, P, inside the liquid  =  Po + 
hρg 
  The pressure at Q is therefore Po + hρg 
  Therefore the pressure at the open end, O, 
due to the liquid = Po + Hρg + hρg. 
  The atmospheric pressure outside the 
open end is Po and is therefore less than 
the pressure of the liquid at O.  Hence the 
liquid will run out, as long as O is below 
the horizontal level with P.  (See diagram 
in column 3)

• State Pascal’s principle and

hydraulic systems e.g. braking 
systems, hydraulic press.   
 
• Perform calculations to 
determine force and pressure in 
hydraulic systems 
 
Pascal’s Principle 
 
Pascal’s Principle states that pressure is 
transmitted equally in all directions in a 
fluid.   
 
Therefore, for a liquid in a narrow tube of 
cross-section area, A1 , connected to a wide 
tube of cross-section area, A2 , it follows 
that  
F1 /  A1  =  F2 /  A2 
Therefore,   F2    =  (F1 /  A1 ) x  A2   
 
It follows that a large force, F2 , can be 
obtained from a smaller force, F1 , if the 
smaller force is applied on fluid in a 
narrow tube that is connected to a wider 
tube.   
 
This principle is applied in hydraulic 
braking systems in vehicles and hydraulic 
lifts at vehicle service station and tyre 
repair workshops. 
Numerical problem-solving 
Students are given practice in solving 
problems involving F1 /  A1  =  F2 /  A2.

WORK AND ENERGY 
 
• Apply the relationship  
work = force x displacement 
to calculate energy transferred   
 
 
Work and energy 
 
If something can do work, we say it possesses 
energy.  Thus, we define energy as the ability to do 
work. 
 
We define work as the product of force, F, and 
displacement, d, in the direction of the force.  
Thus. 
Work  =  F  x  d    (Nm)      …………(1) 
 
Lord Kelvin found that whenever work was done, 
an energy conversion took place.  In fact, the more 
work done, the more energy is obtained.  Thus 
there is an equivalence between work and energy.   
 
1 Nm of work done is equivalent to 1 joule (J) of 
energy converted.  Work can be regarded as a 
process in which one form of energy is converted 
to another. 
 
  
1  Measuring work done 
-  Students connect a spring 
balance (calibrated in N) and 
measure the work done 
against friction in pulling 
horizontally on a block 
placed on the lab desk.  
(Work  =  F  x  d) 
 
-  Students connect a spring 
balance (calibrated in N) and 
measure the work done 
against gravity in raising a 
block through a vertical 
distance, h.                               
(Work  =  F  x  h)

using the equation,

Potential energy 
We define potential energy as stored 
energy. 
-   An object at a height above the ground 
can do work.  It possess gravitational 
potential energy. 
-  A stretched spring (or rubber band) can do 
work.  It possesses elastic potential 
energy. 
-   A battery can do work when connected to 
an electric motor.  We say the battery 
possesses chemical potential energy. 
 
We derive the equation for gravitational 
potential energy, PE, as follows: 
Consider a mass, m, being raised a height, h.  
The force, F, required to raise the mass (at 
constant speed) must be equal to the weight, 
mg, of the mass. The potential energy, PE, 
gained by the mass is equal to the work 
done in lifting the mass.  Therefore,              
PE  =  F x d, that is, 
PE  =  mgh    ……………..(2) 
 
3  Demonstrations of potential energy 
(stored energy) 
-  Place a 30-cm ruler partly protruding 
over the edge of a lab table surface.  
Hold a board eraser at a safe height over 
the protrusion.  The fact that when the 
eraser is released it moves the ruler 
shows that the eraser had (gravitational) 
potential energy. 
-  Show that a stretched rubber band can 
do work in moving a small folded paper 
(do this with attention to safety).

Kinetic energy 
Consider a mass whose initial velocity, vo, is 
changed to a final velocity, v, by the action of a 
force, F.  The force causes the mass to undergo 
an acceleration, a. through a distance, d.  We get 
the following: Work  
=  Fd 
But, by Newton’s Second Law,   F  =  ma 
Therefore work  
  =  mad 
 
But      a =  v² - v0²      (since v² = v0² + 2 ad) 
 
        2d 
Therefore work done  =  m(v² - v0²) x d 
 
 
     
  
2d 
That is, Work (Fd)  =  ½ mv²  -  ½ mv0² ..(3) 
 
The quantity, ½ mv² (or ½ mv0²) is energy, since, 
when work is done, an energy conversion takes 
place.  The quantity, ½ mv² (or ½ mv0²) is called 
kinetic energy (KE), since it is energy due to 
motion. We therefore get, for a mass, m, moving 
with speed, v, the kinetic energy of the mass is 
given by: KE  =  ½ mv² ………..(4) 
5  Demonstration of kinetic energy 
A force is exerted on a dynamics cart for 
a short distance.  Work is done and the 
cart gains kinetic energy.  The kinetic 
energy of the moving cart can do work in 
moving a chalkboard eraser some 
distance along the desk surface.

Assumptions of the Kinetic Theory of 
Matter 
• Matter is made up of tiny particles. 
• The particles are always in motion 
• Particles exert strong forces (of 
attraction or repulsion) on each other 
when their separation distance is very 
small. 
• Collisions between particles are 
perfectly elastic i.e. energy is not lost 
overall by the particles during 
collisions. 
 
Particles of matter 
An atom is the smallest particle of an 
element that retains the chemical 
characteristics of the element.  (An 
element is a substance that cannot be 
broken down into any simpler substance 
by chemical means.  Oxygen and 
hydrogen are elements.  Water is not an 
element since it can be broken down into 
simpler substances, namely, hydrogen and 
oxygen.)

A molecule is the smallest particle of a 
substance that can exist by itself.  A 
molecule can consist of one atom (e.g. the 
helium molecule), more than one atom of 
the same kind (e.g. the oxygen molecule 
has two atoms of oxygen), or atoms of 
different kinds (e.g. the water molecule 
has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom 
of oxygen). 
 
An ion is an atom that is charged, either by 
gain or loss of electrons. 
 
Only certain kinds of substances are made 
up of molecules.  Gases are one example.  
Organic compounds, e.g. wax, are also 
made up of molecules.  (Solid conductors 
consist of a vibrating lattice of positive 
ions among which electrons move freely.  
Compounds like salt (sodium chloride) 
consist of ions of sodium bound tightly 
with ions of chlorine to form giant 
structures.)

Evidence for the Kinetic Theory 
Evidence that particles of matter are 
actually moving can be seen from the 
following: Brownian motion in liquids 
Robert Brown, looking at tiny pollen 
grains through a microscope, noticed that 
the pollen showed continuous, irregular 
vibrations.  He suggested that the 
vibrations were due to the motion of water 
molecules that were bombarding the pollen 
grains.  Hence the name Brownian motion. 
Brownian motion of pollen in water 
Set up a microscope slide with water on 
it and sprinkle a few pollen grains (or 
very fine powder) on the water.  Have 
students state their observations. 
 
Students can also be encouraged to 
check the internet for video clips and 
simulations of this kind of experiment.

Brownian motion in gases 
Particles of smoke in a transparent 
container illuminated with very bright light 
themselves look like tiny specks of light 
when viewed under a microscope.  These 
specks of light are observed to move about 
randomly in jerky fashion.  This is 
explained by assuming that molecules of 
the air in the container are colliding with 
the smoke particles.

STATES OF MATTER 
• Account for the properties of 
solids, liquids & gases in terms 
of motion, energy & 
arrangement of particles, and 
forces between particles.  
• Name the states of matter as 
solids, liquids, gases, and 
demonstrate an awareness that 
there are other states e.g. 
plasma and Bose-Einstein 
Condensate.   
 
States of matter 
Solid 
Solids have fixed shapes.  This is because 
particles that make up a solid are, on the 
average, very close to each other and 
therefore the forces between them are very 
large.  As the particles vibrate, when they 
move closer to each other, repulsion forces 
are very large.  When they move away 
from each other (from the close mean 
separation distance), forces of attraction 
are also very large.  That is why solids are 
“incompressible” and are also not easy to 
pull apart. 
 
 Liquid 
Liquids take the shape of their containers.  
But the particles that make up a liquid 
generally stay together. 
This is because the vibrating particles, on 
the average, are still close to each other, 
but not as close as in solids.  As they move 
toward each other, they experience large 
forces of repulsion.  Hence, like solids, 
liquids are fairly “incompressible”. 
 
However, as particles move away from 
each other, the forces of attraction between 
the particles are not so great because the

Let students try to compress and also to

Students can also try tearing apart a

“elastic” stretching is due to molecules 
arranged in coils like a spring.  When the 
band is straightened out, the molecules 
are now straight and the strong forces 
between molecules become evident.) 
 
Liquid 
-  Fill a syringe with water.  Close the 
bottom end of the syringe.  Let students 
try to compress the water in the syringe.  
The water does not reduce in volume. 
-  Place the same amount of water in

that liquids take the shapes of their 
containers. 
 
Gas

upward to let air inside the barrel.  Seal 
the bottom with your finger and have 
students try to compress the air.  The air 
will show some reduction in volume.

average separation distance is larger.  
Particles can therefore move away from 
each other fairly easily, resulting in a 
liquid taking the shape of its container.  
Particles in a liquid therefore show both 
translation and vibration motions.  
However, the forces of attraction, though 
not as great as in solids, are large enough 
to keep most of the particles together.            
(A few particles at the surface of the liquid 
do, however, gain enough energy to escape 
from the liquid.) 
 
Gas 
Gases have no fixed shape.  They fill any 
container in which they are put.  This is 
because, on the average, particles of a gas 
are very far apart and so, hardly exert any 
force on each other.  Gases are therefore 
compressible and easy to expand as well. 
 
(You can discuss why there is still a 
pressure exerted by the gas that tends to 
oppose compression – the pressure is 
due to molecular bombardment of the 
particles with the walls of the container 
and not due to individual molecules of 
gas repelling each other.)

Relate temperature to molecular 
speeds 
 
Temperature and molecular speeds 
By a theoretical analysis of molecular 
motion, it has been shown that temperature 
of a gas varies directly with the mean 
square speed per molecule in the gas.  At 
absolute zero of temperature, all motion of 
molecules cease. 
 
Pressure and molecular speeds 
When molecules of a gas bombard the 
walls of its container, their rebound causes 
a change in their momentum.  This change 
in momentum results in a force being 
exerted on the walls of the container.  It 
follows that at absolute zero of 
temperature, since all molecular motion 
ceases, the pressure exerted by the gas on 
the walls of its container is theoretically 
zero as well. 
 
Changes of state 
Solid-liquid change 
The change from solid to liquid can be 
brought about by imparting energy to the 
solid by heating.  During this change of 
state, the temperature of the substance 
does not change.  The mean vibrational 
energy per particle does not change.  The 
energy taken in causes work to be done, 
resulting in an increase of the average

separation distance between particles.  The 
change from solid to liquid at constant 
temperature is called melting and the 
temperature at which it occurs is called the 
melting point of the solid.  The reverse 
process at constant temperature is called 
freezing (or fusion or solidification).  The

During freezing, heat is given up by the

Liquid-gas change 
The change of state from liquid to gas can 
also be brought about by heating.  During 
the change of state, the temperature of the 
substance remains constant and the average 
separation distance between the particles 
increases tremendously.  The mean 
separation is so large that particles hardly 
exert forces of attraction or repulsion on 
each other and so they move about 
practically freely at high speeds.  The 
change from liquid to gas at constant 
temperature is called boiling.   
Observation of boiling and condensation

The temperature at which boiling occurs is 
called the boiling point of the liquid at the 
pressure at which the boiling occurs.  
Boiling takes place throughout a liquid and 
bubbles of gas formed rise to the top of the 
liquid and burst, releasing the gas.  The 
change from gas to liquid at constant

During condensation, heat is given up to

Dissolved solids 
Dissolved solids cause boiling point 
temperatures to be elevated and 
freezing point temperatures to be 
lowered.  When ice at temperatures 
below zero is mixed with salt, the ice 
melts (and freezes) at a lower 
temperature.  The solution formed is 
not only colder than pure, melting ice, 
but can also make good contact, say, 
with the metal container in an ice-
cream can, resulting in quicker 
formation of ice cream. 
Effect of dissolved salt on boiling and 
melting points of water 
 
Students design an investigation 
(involving control of variables) to show 
the effect of dissolved salt on boiling 
point of water.  After discussion of 
students’ ideas, the teacher can carry out 
the experiment, paying due attention to 
safety. 
 
Students can also design investigations 
on the effect of dissolved salt on melting 
or freezing point of water.

Pressure 
A high pressure above a liquid surface 
causes boiling point to be higher.  (This is 
because more energy has to be imparted to 
the molecules of liquid to create enough 
pressure in the bubbles of gas formed to 
overcome the external pressure and burst.) 
A pressure cooker makes use of this fact.  
Its tight cover prevents steam from 
escaping and hence a buildup of pressure 
due to the hot steam occurs above the 
surface of the contents of the pot.  The 
liquid therefore boils at a higher 
temperature, resulting in food cooking 
more quickly. 
A low pressure, e.g. up in a mountain, 
causes liquids to boil at lower 
temperatures.  That is why boiling an egg 
up a mountain takes so long and may 
require using a pressure cooker. 
 
Pressure cooker demonstration 
Show students a pressure cooker and its 
rubber seal.  Show the pressure weights 
and the safety valve.  Point out that a 
pressure-cooker should never be opened 
when contents are boiling as the pressure 
under the cover can cause steam to 
escape under high pressure, leading to 
severe steam burns.  Show how the 
pressure-cooker is first left to cool 
naturally, and then tap water is run over 
the pot for further cooling.  Read the 
manufacturer’s instructions to the 
students.

Define and demonstrate phase 
changes.  (sublimation,                    
re-sublimation-deposition, 
melting, freezing condensation 
and vaporization.)  
 
Changes of phase 
Above a certain temperature, called the 
critical temperature, substances cannot 
become liquid, no matter how much 
pressure is exerted.  Below this 
temperature, a substance can show various 
transitions between solid, liquid and gas.  
We refer to these transitions as changes in 
phase.  The following are some phase 
changes: 
Vaporization is the change of solid, or 
liquid, to the vapour phase. 
Evaporation is the change of liquid to 
vapour at the surface of a liquid.  
Molecules near the surface of the liquid 
may transfer some of their kinetic energy 
by collisions to molecules at the surface.  
The latter may acquire enough energy to 
overcome the forces of attraction of the 
rest of the molecules in the liquid and 
escape from the liquid surface.  Since the 
liquid loses energy to the molecules of gas 
that escape, the average kinetic energy of 
the rest of the molecules of the liquid 
decreases.  Hence, the temperature of the 
liquid drops, since temperature is directly 
related to the mean square speed of 
molecules, which, in turn, is proportional 
to the average kinetic energy per molecule

-   Sublimation and deposition using 
iodine or naphthalene (naphthalene 
becomes vapour at room temperature, 
that is why it smells so strongly)

(KE  =  ½ mv2) 
Unlike boiling, evaporation occurs at any 
temperature. 
Boiling is the change from liquid to 
vapour at a particular temperature and 
pressure.  During boiling, the temperature 
of the substance does not change. 
Condensation is the reverse of boiling.  It 
is the change from the vapour phase to the 
liquid phase. 
 
Sublimation is the change from solid 
directly into vapour without passing 
through a liquid phase.  Solid carbon 
dioxide sublimes at atmospheric pressure.  
At standard pressure, ice goes through the 
liquid phase before becoming vapour.  
However, at very low pressures, ice also 
sublimes.  
Deposition is the change from the vapour 
phase directly to the solid phase.  Like 
sublimation and boiling, deposition 
depends on the prevailing pressure. 
Melting is the change from the solid to the 
liquid phase.  The reverse, freezing is the 
change from the liquid to the solid phase. 
Ionization produced by high temperatures, 
results in substances being converted into 
plasmas.  The reverse, deionization is the 
conversion of plasmas to liquids.

Usefulness of liquid-vapour phase 
change 
A large quantity of energy is needed to 
convert a liquid into vapour.  Certain 
substances easily undergo this change by 
taking energy from the container in contact 
with them.  The container becomes cooled 
as a result. (Such substances are said to be 
volatile and are used refrigerants.)  
Refrigerants are used in refrigerators and 
air-conditioners.  The refrigerant is 
circulated in metal pipes and allowed to 
expand through fine holes to become 
vapour.  In the vaporization process, the 
refrigerant takes heat from the metal pipes, 
which in turn take heat by conduction from 
the food or air in contact with the metal 
pipes. The vapour then passes through a 
condenser which is usually painted black 
to assist in radiating heat from the vapour, 
causing the vapour to condense back to 
liquid.

• Design and perform experiment 
to demonstrate/verify 
Archimedes principle 
 
• Use Archimedes Principle to 
explain floating and sinking  
 
• Perform experiments to 
investigate the ease of flotation 
in fluids of different densities. 
 
• Discuss everyday applications 
of Archimedes principle- such 
as Andros water barge, cruise 
ships, shipping between waters 
of different densities.  
  
 
Archimedes’ Principle 
The upthrust on an object placed in a fluid 
is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by 
the object: i.e. 
Upthrust  =  weight of fluid displaced For 
an object to float, the upthrust on the object 
must be equal the weight of the object: i.e. 
Upthrust  =  weight of object 
Thus, a floating object displaces its own 
weight of fluid in which it floats.  This last 
statement is sometimes called the Principle 
of flotation. 
 
Archimedes’ Principle and flotation 
If an object displaces a volume, V, of fluid 
of density, ρ, the mass, m, of the fluid 
displaced is given by 
m  =  ρV. 
The weight of the fluid displaced is 
therefore given by  
W  =  ρVg. 
 
Since upthrust is equal to weight of fluid 
displaced, then upthrust is greatest when 
density of fluid is greatest and volume of 
liquid displaced is greatest.  That is why 
ships and barges are made with large 
volumes (to displace large volumes of 
water so as to obtain large upthrust) but  
Verifying Archimedes’ Principle 
Students design and carry out an 
experiment to verify Archimedes’ 
Principle.  You can show them the 
following equipment they can use:  
spring balance, thread, stone, overflow 
can, suitable beaker and top-pan (or 
beam) balance.  They may request other 
equipment if they wish. 
 
Investigating floatation in fluids 
 
A narrow test tube, loaded with some 
sand for stability, is placed in liquids of 
various densities (e.g. fresh water, oil, 
salt water, ice water, warm water).  
Students observe and record the depths 
the test tube sinks in the liquids of 
various densities and make a conclusion. 
Students can even calibrate their test 
tubes using the known densities and 
given a liquid of unknown density (e.g. 
milk or a sugar solution made up by the 
teacher) to infer its density from the 
depth the test tube sinks.  In effect, they 
would have made a hydrometer.

hollow so that their weights are smaller 
than the upthrust on them. 
 
Density is mass per unit volume of a given 
substance.  The SI unit of density is kgm-3 
(kg/m3), however, it is sometimes more 
convenient to use gcm-3 (g/cm3) for small 
values.  
Density = volume
mass                                          
Density of water = 1 g/cm3 or 1000 kg/m3  
An object will float in a fluid if its density 
is less than the density of the liquid, i.e. the 
volume of fluid displaced has a greater 
mass than the object itself.  
Density is useful for comparing materials 
and deciding which material is best for a 
given job.  
• Volume and density are inversely related, 
the higher the volume occupied by a given 
mass, the lower the density. 
• Mass and density are directly related, the 
higher the mass in a given volume, the higher 
the density. 
• When a substance is heated, its mass 
remains the same, its volume increases (since 
it expands) and density decreases 
• When a substance is cooled, its mass 
remains the same, its volume decreases 
(since it contracts) and density increases 
A discussion could follow as to ease of 
floatation of ships in the following waters: 
Cold and fresh; Cold and salty 
Warm and fresh; Warm and salty 
 
Students can then do research as to what are 
the Plimsoll Lines in international shipping. 
 
Practical Activities 
Designing a density tower using four to five 
liquids of varying densities 
 
Observing the behaviour of an orange with 
and without its peel in pure water 
 
Observing the behaviour of an egg in pure 
water and salt water. Repeat with a can of 
soda. 
 
Finding density of a liquid e.g. water or oil 
Place measuring cylinder on balance. Add 
liquid. Reading on measuring cylinder = V, 
change in mass on balance = m. Use 
formula. density = mass/volume 
 
Finding density of solid e.g. aluminum 
block, small stone, rubber stopper 
Finding mass: Use balance 
Finding the volume: To find out volume of a 
regular object, use mathematical formula. To 
find out volume of an irregular object by 
displacement –use a displacement can or put 
object into a measuring cylinder with water 
and the rise of water is the volume of the 
object. Density = mass/ volume

• Make musical instruments 
All musical instruments, have a vibrating 
system which produces all musical sounds e.g. 
the strings on the guitar, or the air column in 
the clarinet, and the head of the drum are 
examples of vibrating systems.  
Wind instruments depend on the vibration of a 
column of air to produce sound. The column of 
air vibrates when wind is blown into or across 
an instrument. Changes in pitch or frequency 
may be achieved by altering length, diameter 
and tension of the vibrating material.  
Most string instruments have a sounding board 
which increases the intensity of a sound.  The 
vibration made on the sounding board is called 
forced vibration because the natural frequency 
of the board usually does not match the 
frequency of the vibrating string. As the two 
frequencies match when the string is plucked, 
resonance amplifies the sound. 
 
Doppler effect: when waves are created in 
a medium by a moving source, the 
frequency observed at a point towards 
which the source is moving becomes 
greater.  When the source moves away 
from that point, the frequency (pitch ) 
becomes less. 
Stretch a rubber band between one’s  finger 
and thumb. Pluck the rubber band and 
describe the loudness of the sound. Place the 
same rubber band around a pie plate and 
pluck the rubber band. They will find that 
the sound of rubber band is much louder. 
Students can construct other simple musical 
instruments using the principles learned. e.g.

To identify the colours of the 
spectrum produced when white 
light passes through a prism. 
White light is a mixture of several colours (red, 
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), which 
may be separated by refraction. The band of 
colours formed is called a spectrum and the 
process is called dispersion. Refraction of light 
through a prism, or diamond and rainbows are 
examples of dispersion, 
• Practical Activity – Forming a 
spectrum with a prism 
Using a raybox, shine a ray of 
white light through a glass prism 
and onto a white screen 
• Repeat using a convex lens to 
focus the rays to form a pure 
spectrum

White light can be recombined to produce white 
light by:

deviated in an opposite direction and 
(ii) spinning a disc at high speeds with the colours 
of the spectrum painted on its sectors

To describe the relationship 
between the colours of the spectrum 
and their wavelength. 
The colours of the spectrum vary in their 
wavelength. In transparent materials, such as 
glass, the colours of the spectrum travel at 
different speeds based on their wavelength. The 
greater the wavelength, the slower the speed and 
the greater the angle of refraction. Violet has the 
shortest wavelength and is refracted through the 
greatest angle since its speed decreases the most. 
Red has the longest wavelength and is refracted 
least since its speed decreases the least.

To describe the factors that affect 
colour of an object 
The colour of an object depends on the colour of 
light falling on it and the colour it transmits or 
reflects. 
The primary colours of light are red, green and 
blue. Secondary colours of light are yellow, 
magenta and cyan. A filter only allows light to 
pass through of certain colours only e.g a green 
filter only transmits mostly green light and 
absorbs other colours. Opaque objects are seen as 
reflected light. In general, white reflects all light 
falling on it, coloured objects reflect the colour 
they contain and absorb other colours e.g. a red 
object appears red in white light because it reflect 
red only and absorbs the other colours of the 
spectrum. It also appears red in red light, but 
black (the absence of colour) in green light since 
no light is reflected.

• Describe the recti-linear 
propagation of light, 
justifying with examples in 
everyday life  
• Construct a pin-hole camera 
(model –viewing images, 
real- taking actual pictures) 
Recti-linear propagation describes the 
tendency of Electromagnetic waves (light) to 
travel in straight lines. Light only deviates 
from a straight line when the medium it is 
travelling through changes density, i.e. when 
refraction occurs. Light does not deviate 
when travelling through a homogenous 
medium, which has the same refractive index 
throughout. 
Evidence of rectilinear propagation of light is 
provided by the observation of light travelling 
from a cinema projector on the screen; the fact 
that is not possible to see around corners; the 
formation of shadows cast by opaque objects; 
eclipses and through the construction of a pin-
hole camera 
 
A pinhole camera consists of a closed 
box with a screen and a small pinhole at 
the other end. (Johnson, Keith (2006) New 
Physics for You  Pg. 174) 
• The image formed in a pinhole camera 
is real and inverted. 
• The closer the pinhole camera is to

Static electricity is the accumulation of electrical 
charges on the surface of a material, usually an 
insulator or non-conductor of electricity. It is 
called “static” because there is no current 
flowing. It is usually caused when certain 
materials are rubbed against each other—like 
wool on plastic or the soles of your shoes on the 
carpet. It is also caused when materials are 
pressed against each other and pulled apart.  
 
Activity 1: Rub a piece of ebonite 
(very hard, black rubber) across a 
piece of animal fur. Explain what 
happens.  
 
The fur does not hold on to its 
electrons as strongly as the 
ebonite. Some of the electrons will 
be ripped off of the fur and stay on 
the ebonite. The fur now has a 
slightly positive charge (it lost 
some electrons) and the ebonite is 
slightly negative (it gained some 
electrons).The net charge is still 
zero between the two… remember 
the conservation of charge. No 
charges have been created or 
destroyed, just moved around.

Both +ve and –ve electrostatic charges are 
produced by the movement of electrons. The +ve 
charge is caused by electrons moving away from 
the object whilst the –ve charge is caused by 
electrons moving onto the object. For example if a 
polyethene rod is rubbed with a cloth it becomes 
negatively charged because electrons move from 
the cloth to the polyethene rod. If an acetate rod is 
rubbed with a cloth, it becomes positively charged 
because electrons move from the acetate rod to the 
cloth. 
Activity 2: Rub a glass rod with a 
piece of silk. Explain what 
happens.  
 
While, this is similar to activity 1, 
in this case the silk holds onto the 
electrons more strongly than the 
glass. Electrons are ripped off of 
the glass and go on to the silk. The 
glass is now positive and the silk is 
negative.

Opposite charges attract.      Like charges repel  
 
There is a force between the charges and the bigger

This is called Coulomb’s Law of charges which 
states: The force between two charged objects is 
directly proportional to the product of their charges 
and inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance between them.  
Students can suspend charged 
polyethene and acetate rods to 
investigate the law of charges. 
 
Students can charge a polyethene 
and an acetate rod (which are

zero charge.  
 
 
 
 
 A charged object attracts a neutral object by 
electrostatic induction. This is the redistribution of 
electric charge on one material under the influence 
of an electric charge on a nearby object. 
When a negatively charged object is brought near a 
neutral object, it induces a positive charge on the 
near side of the object and a negative charge on the 
far side. This causes the negatively charged object 
to attract the neutral one.

It is possible to charge an object positively or

different materials together, a process known as 
charging by friction.  Since the two objects are made 
of different materials, their atoms will hold onto 
their electrons with different strengths. The strengths 
with which materials hold onto electrons is shown

• 
Describe the use the electroscope to 
detect the presence of a charge and 
the sign of charge on objects  
 
• 
An electroscope can be used to detect the 
presence of a charge, by induction and by 
contact. 
• 
If a positive or negative charge is brought near an 
uncharged electroscope the leaf will deflect by 
induction.  
• 
Similarly, if a charged object is brought near an 
electroscope of the same charge, the deflection 
of the leaf will increase.  
• 
This increase in deflection is the only sure way of 
testing a charge because both an uncharged 
object and one of the same charge will cause a 
decrease in deflection.

Practical Uses of Static Charges 
The ability of opposite charges to attract each other 
(or for a charged object to attract an uncharged 
object) in static electricity is what's used when 
designing applications for it. Here are a few 
examples: 
 Dust removal: There are some appliances that 
can eliminate dust from the air, like air 
purifiers. They use static electricity to alter the 
charges in the dust particles so that they stick to 
a plate or filter of the purifier that has an 
opposite charge as that of the dust (opposite 
charges attract each other). 
This effect is also used in industrial 
smokestacks to reduce the pollution that they 
generate, although they work in a very large 
scale, the effect is basically the same as the 
home air purifier.

 Photocopying: The photocopier or Xerox 
machine uses static electricity to copy print to a 
page. This is done through the science of 
xerography. 
One version of this device electrically charges 
ink so that it will stick to the paper in the 
designated areas. Another version of a 
photocopier uses charges to stick the ink to a 
drum, which then transfers it to the paper. 
 Car painting: To make sure a car's paint is 
uniform and that it will resist the high speeds 
and weather to protect the car's metal interior, it 
is applied with a static charge. The metal body 
of the car is submerged in a substance that 
charges it positively, and the paint is charged 
negatively with the paint sprayer. 
This process ensures a uniform layer of paint. 
 
Hazards of Static Electricity 
The main hazards of static electricity are: 
 the creation of sparks in an explosive or 
flammable atmosphere. 
These sparks can set off an explosion or fire. 
The danger is greatest when flammable liquids 
are being poured or transferred. 
 the risk of electric shock.  
If the static charge build up is high, it can be 
discharge (dissipate) via a spark. This can be 
dangerous or lethal. 
Most static electricity control measures provide 
ways for the static charges to discharge (dissipate) 
harmlessly before sparks occur. 
Some ways to prevent static charges from 
accumulating on materials are: grounding; 
humidification; static collectors and additives.

• discuss the function, 
parts of operation of a 
simple cell 
The simple voltaic (or galvanic) electrical cell, is 
an electro-chemical device which converts 
chemical energy into electrical energy. It consists 
of two electrodes (terminals) made of different 
materials and an electrolyte.  
When a cell is a part of a complete circuit, 
positive ions and electrons are generated at the 
negative electrode. The positive ions flow into 
into the electrolyte, while the electrons take the 
easiest path to the positive electrode by flowing 
around the outside circuit. At the positive 
electrode, incoming electrons recombine with 
ions taken out of the electrolyte, so completing 
the circuit. Conventional current leaves the 
electrode labelled +, flows through the external 
circuit, and returns to the other terminal labelled 
-
  
pg 264 Physics for CXC Avison  
The exact reactions depend on the materials from 
which the electrodes and electrolyte are made. As 
a cell generates power, the chemicals inside it are 
gradually converted into different chemicals and 
its voltage slowly falls. The typical output of a 
simple cell varies from 0 to 6V.

or ‘S’ pole. When a magnet is allowed to 
move freely by being suspended, it always

Magnets are made up of groups of atoms

within magnets. A magnetic domain is a

each atom acts as a small magnet called a 
dipole. They are grouped together in 
domains. Domains in an un-magnetised 
ferromagnetic material are arranged in 
random directions (haphazardly). When the 
ferromagnetic material is exposed to a 
magnetic field, the domains line up in the 
magnetic field. All the north poles point in

• Explain the factors 
determining field strength 
(closeness of poles, 
alignment of domains).   
 
 
 
Magnetic field   refers to the space around a 
magnet, which produces a magnetic force. (i.e. 
the area where magnetism acts).  The strength of 
a magnet is determined by how well the domains 
are lined up. When all the domains are lined up, 
is termed a saturated magnet and therefore 
cannot get any stronger. 
The closer the poles the stronger the magnetic 
field strength.

The magnetosphere deflects most of the charged 
particles from the Sun around our planet. Charged 
particles trapped in the magnetosphere also create the 
beautiful spectacle of light, known as auroras (see 
part b in figure below).

The magnetosphere still allows a few solar wind 
particles to get through, especially near the magnetic 
poles. Once inside the magnetosphere, these particles 
move along magnetic field lines, collecting in 
charged particle belts that encircle our planet. (These 
belts are often called the Van Allen belts after their 
discoverer.) The high energies of the particles in 
charged particle belts can be hazardous to spacecraft 
and astronauts passing through them

1  THE ATOMIC 
THEORY 
• State the Atomic Theory  
 
 
The Atomic Theory: 
 
According to the Atomic Theory 
 
-  Matter is made up of tiny particles. 
-  The particles cannot be destroyed by chemical 
means. 
-  Atoms of the same element are alike; atoms of 
different elements are different. 
 
 
Definition of an element 
 
An element is a substance that is made up of one 
kind of matter only (e.g. aluminium and sulphur are 
elements because the former consists of aluminium 
only and the latter sulphur only;  water is not an 
element since it consists of two different kinds of 
substances, hydrogen and oxygen).  
 
 
Definition of atom 
 
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that 
retains the chemical properties of the element. 
1.  Making and displaying models 
(What the Atomic Theory puts forward 
is a particle model of matter.  There are 
other models (e.g. wave-probability 
model).  Using polystyrene balls you 
(or students) can make and display 
models of 
- elements (similar balls stuck 
together)  
- substances that are not elements but 
combinations of elements e.g. ice 
(the building block water molecule 
model should also be pointed out) 
 
2  Looking at “photographs” of atoms 
(note that these are not photographs 
taken with light, so they do not 
represent what atoms look like;  the 
“pictures”, taken with special devices 
only provide evidence to support the 
particle model of matter). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Models depicting matter 
being made up of atoms 
These could be made 
ahead of time or during 
class time, using 
polystyrene balls of at 
least two different sizes 
and some method of 
attaching polystyrene 
balls together.

2  STRUCTURE OF THE 
ATOM 
• Describe the importance of 
alpha particle scattering 
experiments with regard to 
the structure of the atom  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Geiger-Marsden Experiment 
(Geiger and Marsden were Rutherford’s 
research assistants) 
 
In this experiment, positively charged alpha (α) 
particles (helium nuclei) were aimed at very thin 
sheets of gold foil. 
-  The fact that most of the particles went straight 
through the foil suggested that most of the atom 
was an empty space. 
-  Since and only a few alpha particles were 
scattered, this suggested that: an atom has a very 
heavy, but very tiny, positively charged part 
(which is now called the nucleus). 
 
The experiment confirmed that the atom contained 
a positively charged, but heavy and tiny nucleus.  
The experiment showed that an existing “plum 
pudding” model of the atom, where positive charge 
in the atom was assumed spread out as a cloud 
within the atom, could not be correct. 
 
1 Simulation of αlpha particle 
scattering 
  
Show students how to operate the 
simulation.  There are two models 
being simulated – paths taken by alpha 
particles according to a nuclear 
(Rutherford) model, and also according 
to a “plum pudding” model 
   
- Most of the alpha particles show 
straight, or nearly straight, paths.   
- Very few are deflected backwards, 
confirming the Rutherford model.  
- All the alpha particles go straight 
through in the plum pudding model.  
This shows that there are no heavy, 
positive scattering centres.

• Describe the properties of sub-

Structure of the atom 
 
In 1932, James Chadwick discovered the 
neutron in the nucleus.  The neutron had 
almost the same mass as a proton, but had no 
charge.  It is believed that neutrons help to 
keep the protons together in the nucleus 
(protons are positively charged and would 
have repelled each other, causing the nucleus 
to break up).  The atom was now believed to 
be made up of a tiny, but heavy, nucleus, 
consisting of positively charged protons and 
zero charged neutrons; negatively charged 
electrons orbited the nucleus.  Since atoms are 
neutral, the number of positive charges 
(protons) are equal to the number of negative 
charges (electrons).

-  the proton and the neutron each has a 
mass that is about 2000 times that the 
mass of an electron 
-  the mass unit, u, is 1/12 the mass of a 
carbon-12 atom and that 1 u  =  1.66 x  
10-27 kg.  However, the values of these 
masses in kg do not need to be

3. DESCRIBING THE 
NUCLEUS 
 
• Define the terms: atomic 
number (Z), mass number (A), 
neutron number (X)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Define isotopes, noting that 
isotopes of the same element 
have identical chemical 
properties, and give examples 
of isotopes including 
radioisotopes  
Numbers describing the nucleus 
Atomic number (Z); the number of protons in 
the nucleus (this will also be the same as the 
number of electrons orbiting a neutral atom, and 
it is this number of electrons that determines the 
chemical character of each element).   
Mass number (A):  the total number of particles 
(protons + neutrons) in the nucleus.  The mass 
number gives an idea of the total mass of an 
atom, since the electrons have negligible mass. 
Neutron number (X): the number of neutrons 
within a nucleus.   
 
A simple reasoning shows that  A  =  Z  +  X 
 
Nuclear symbols 
Nuclear symbols are written by placing the mass 
number as a superscript and the atomic number 
as a subscript on the left of the chemical symbol 
of the element.  Thus, the carbon-12 nucleus is 
written as 126 C, since the carbon-12 nucleus has 
6 protons and 6 neutrons.  
  
Isotope 
Isotopes of an element have atoms that have the 
same number of protons but different numbers of 
neutrons.  Thus isotopes of an element have the 
same atomic number (hence the same chemical 
properties) but different mass numbers.  Some 
isotopes are radioactive.

4  RADIOACTIVITY 
• Design and perform  
investigations on naturally 
occurring radioactivity in the 
environment  
 
• Account for the presence of 
background radiation. (cosmic 
rays, earth-minerals, foods, etc)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Describe the detection of 
radioactive emissions using GM 
tube, ratemeter/counter and cloud 
chamber  
 
 
Discovery of naturally occurring 
radioactivity Natural radioactivity was 
discovered quite by chance in 1896 by the 
French scientist, Henri Becquerel.  Shortly 
after, Ernest Rutherford, experimenting in 
Canada, and Marie and Pierre Curie, 
experimenting in France, investigated  
 
 
Sources of naturally occurring 
radioactivity: These include 
- cosmic rays (charged particles e.g. protons 
that reach the Earth from space;  one source 
of cosmic rays is the Sun) 
-  minerals that make up the Earth 
(especially, but not restricted to, those with 
large mass numbers e.g uranium-235) 
-  foods, objects and living organisms (since 
these are made from minerals that come 
from the Earth) 
 
 
Detection of radioactivity 
First detected (by Becquerel) by fogging that 
the emissions produced on photographic 
film.  Later, other detectors were developed 
such as: the Geiger-Muller tube  that could 
assist in determining the number of 
emissions detected  and  cloud chambers that 
could show the tracks of these emissions 
(through no fields or through electric or 
magnetic fields). 
Investigations 
In all investigations, we must pay 
attention to controlling variables.  We 
suggest using only materials common to 
our environment as other radioactive 
materials are too dangerous for high 
school demonstrations or experiments. 
 
1 Measuring background radiation - 
using a Geiger-Muller tube connected 
to a counter or ratemeter, you can 
measure the background radiation in 
places such as the lab or outdoors. 
 
2  Other investigations 
    It is said that the food we eat does emit 
radiation.  One such investigation is 
described in Physics for CSEC, by 
Farley and Trotz, p 575.

of their nature, penetration 
ability, ionization effects, 
deflection by electric & 
magnetic fields, speeds  
 
• Describe safety precautions to 
protect from harmful radiation 
Nature of radioactive emissions 
Rutherford’s investigations identified three types of 
emissions radiated from the nucleus: 
-  alpha particles (helium nuclei) 
-  beta particles (high speed electrons coming from the 
nucleus) 
-  gamma rays (high energy electromagnetic waves emitted 
by the nucleus). 
 
Harm caused by radioactivity 
Radioactivity is extremely dangerous.  What makes it so 
dangerous is that its effects are not usually felt at the time of 
contact but manifests later. 
-  on entering living matter, alpha particles ionize matter, 
disrupting cell functioning; when they come to a stop, 
they also give up their energy and cause cells to overheat.  
Since alpha particles have short range, most of the 
damage is to the outer layer of the skin. 
-  beta particles penetrate deeper into living tissue and also 
disrupt ionic reactions within cells 
-  gamma rays are not only the most penetrating of the three, 
but also damage chromosomes, affecting cell functions, 
including reproduction  
Symptoms of radiation sickness include:  loss of body hair, 
nausea, a feeling of exhaustion, drop in white blood-cell 
count and sterility after overexposure 
Protection from harmful radioactivity 
Clearly, only trained persons should be handling radioactive 
materials.  Materials should be handled with tools - never 
with bare hands, lead aprons should be worn, sources should 
never be pointed toward users or other living organisms, 
monitoring devices and alarms should be present, there 
should be no eating or drinking, and radioactive materials 
must be locked away in lead containers when not in use.

Using the textbook, lead

three types of radiations in terms

constant.  
 
The object is moving with a constant 
velocity of 11 m/s. 
 
- If the graph of a position vs. time is 
curved, the slope, and hence the velocity, 
is changing.  The slope of the tangent line 
represents the velocity at a given time, i.e. 
the instantaneous velocity.

graph of the walk is plotted.  The 
following walks might be done:

-  slowly at constant speed, stopping for 
about 2 seconds, then resuming at the 
same speed to the other wall 
-  slowly at constant speed from one wall,

ACCELERATION 
EXPERIMENTALLY 
• determine experimentally 
acceleration due to gravity 
using the free fall method 
 
 
 
 
 
Free fall 
At the same location on Earth and in the 
absence of air resistance, all objects fall 
under the same constant acceleration. We 
call this acceleration, acceleration due to 
gravity, g. It has a value of -9.8 m/s2. So, 
the equations of motion can be applied to 
free falling objects, replacing a with g. 
 
For an object dropped from rest the 
equation  
x2 =x1 + v1 t + 
2
1 at2  becomes x2 = 
2
1 gt2 
(x1is considered zero). Hence the distance 
travelled by the object is directly 
proportional to t2. An object can be dropped 
from several different heights, each of 
which is timed. A graph of d vs. t2 is then 
plotted, its slope is 
2
1 g. 
Free-fall methods for determining 
acceleration due to gravity, g 
Free-fall methods typically involve very 
short time intervals and special equipment.  
Methods that can be tried include: 
 
- Simulations 
- Special free-fall timing equipment 
- Ticker-tape equipment 
- Cell phone, digital camera or camcorder 
 
1  Simulations 
A fun simulation is the Colorado PhET 
Vacuum Drop, where objects are dropped 
from a given height near the surface of a 
planet and the time taken to reach the 
surface is read.  The values for g near the 
surface of each planet can be calculated 
using equation (ii). 
 
 
 
2  Special free-fall timing  
     equipment  
These include photogates and ball-and-
pad equipment connected to a millisecond 
timer.  These can be used in a teacher 
demonstration and the students calculate 
g using equation (ii).  They can test if the 
mass of the falling object makes a 
difference to the value for g.

HISTORY 
Newton’s First Law of Motion 
Every object remains in its state of rest or 
of uniform motion in a straight line, unless 
a net force acts on it. 
Inertia 
Inertia is the tendency of an object to 
remain at rest, if originally at rest, or to 
continue its state of uniform motion in a 
straight line. Mass is a measure of an 
object’s inertia. The more mass an object 
has, the greater its inertia. 
Net force 
When forces are parallel to each other, the 
net force is the sum. When they are anti- 
parallel, the net force is the difference.

the body on a trolley so that the body 
cannot move in the trolley. Let a trolley 
A collide with B, which is at rest but is 
free to move. The “head” jerks back 
because it wants to remain where it was 
originally, i.e. because of the head’s

4 Demonstration of Newton’s Second 
Law 
The apparatus on the right can be used to 
demonstrate Newton’s Second Law 
qualitatively. 
- A constant force F is applied to a trolley 
of mass m by means of a spring balance. 
The acceleration is observed. The trolley 
is loaded so as to double the mass and the 
same force F is applied. The acceleration 
becomes reduced. 
- Using a constant mass the force F is 
doubled and the acceleration observed. 
The acceleration increases.

• State Newton’s second law of 
motion in terms of acceleration. 
• Investigate the relationship 
between mass, applied force 
and acceleration 
When the net force on an object is zero, the 
object either stays at rest or moves in a 
straight line with constant speed. We say 
that such an object is in equilibrium. The 
diagrams show two cases of equilibrium 
and the forces involved. 
• Manipulate and use the 
relationship Force =mass x 
acceleration to solve problems 
Newton’s Second Law of Motion (in 
terms of acceleration) 
The acceleration of an object is directly 
proportional to the net force acting on it 
and inversely proportional to its mass. In 
equation form, a = F/m or 
F = ma ...................... (1)

Newton’s Third Law of Motion 
If an object A exerts a force on an object 
B, the object B exerts an equal and 
opposite force on the object A. 
Discuss the following, asking students if 
they illustrate Newton’s Third Law of 
Motion: 
Two people pulling a rope or string at 
opposite ends (Yes.) 
Jet aircraft: the force of the engines on the 
air they expel is equal and opposite to the 
force of the air on the engines. The 
engines are connected to the aircraft and 
this force of the air therefore causes the 
aircraft to move forward. (Yes.) 
Launching a rocket (Yes.) 
Athletes are able to do high jump because 
the force they press on the ground is equal 
and opposite to the force the ground pushes 
on them. (Yes.)

A book remains stationary on a table 
because the normal contact force is equal 
and opposite to the weight of the book. 
(No! Although the forces are equal and 
opposite, this is NOT a case of the force of 
A on B being equal and opposite to the 
force of B on A. Weight is provided by the 
pull of the Earth, not the pull of the table. 
Actually, these equal and opposite forces 
can be explained by Newton’s Second 
Law. Since the book is in equilibrium, the 
net force on the book is zero, and therefore 
the two forces must be equal and opposite.) 
Important note: 
This last example shows that we must 
avoid teaching Newton’s Law as “action 
and reaction are equal and opposite”, as 
this tends to result in misconceptions in 
students’ minds. The Law should be taught 
in terms of two objects exerting forces on 
each other.

energy 
-  not renewable in our lifetime; known oil 
resources are expected to last to only 
about the middle of this century 
-  very polluting to the air, water and land:  
oil spills are toxic in water and also 
smother aquatic life; the air becomes

The need for developing and using 
alternative sources of energy 
-  The effects of fossil fuel use are very 
damaging to the planet 
-  Fossil fuels will soon run out 
-  As the world becomes more developed and 
also as the world population keeps growing, 
there is an increasing demand for energy 
 
The following are some sources being pursued: 
Hydroelectric: Potential energy of water stored 
in reservoirs at a height is transformed into 
kinetic energy at the base of the reservoir as the 
water falls.  The running water causes turbines 
connected to generators to spin.  The generators 
convert the kinetic energy into electrical energy.  
Wind: Wind causes turbines connected to 
generators to spin.  The generators convert the 
kinetic energy into electrical energy.  
Solar voltaic: Solar cells convert light into 
electricity 
Solar thermal: Blackened metal objects 
containing water heat up the water when 
exposed to sunlight.  
Also, water gets heated up inside a closed glass 
container by the “greenhouse effect” 
Nuclear Energy is obtained from nuclei of 
atoms when fission or fusion takes place.  The 
energy comes from mass that is converted 
according to the Einstein equation = mc2. 
Bio-fuels: Energy is obtained by combustion of 
ethanol or wood.  Biogas fuel is also produced

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
• Relate temperature changes to 
thermal expansion/contraction 
of various materials  
• Describe the anomalous 
expansion of water between 
0oC and 4oC.  
• Interpret volume/temperature, 
density/temperature graphs for 
water.  
• Use the anomalous expansion 
of water to account for 
phenomena such as the 
freezing over of lakes, 
bursting of containers as their 
contents freeze e.g.water pipes  
• Usually as temperature increases the 
particles average energy and thus they 
vibrate more, pushing against each other 
resulting in expansion.   
 
• Water contracts when cooled steadily up 
to 40C for the same mass of water the 
volume therefore gets smaller giving rise 
to a larger density.  Water is densest at 
40C. As cooling continues below 40C, 
water behaves anomalously because it 
starts to expand.  As it expands water 
becomes less dense.  As cooling 
continues water will freeze at  00C (at 
sea level, at atmospheric pressure) 
 
In collaborative groups, students 
demonstrate the following effects of 
heat: 
• expansion of solids (the ball & ring 
and bar & gauge experiments) 
• expansion of liquids when heated  
• expansion of gases when heated.

• Describe heat as the transfer of 
thermal energy from one object 
to another due to a temperature 
difference between them.  
 
 
 
 
 
• Define internal energy of a 
substance and describe the 
factors (mass, temperature,

• Heat is defined as the energy that flows 
from hotter objects to colder objects.  
Heat passes form one object to another 
in the form of infrared rays.  When heat 
is absorbed by a body it increases the 
kinetic and/or potential energy of its 
molecules. Temperature describes how 
hot or cold a body is with respect to a 
given standard. Temperature is a 
measure of the average kinetic energy of 
the particles of the body. 
 
• Thermal energy, internal energy: the 
total (kinetic and potential) energy of all 
the particles of a substance.                        
The greater the number of particles (& 
therefore mass) and temperature of the 
substance, the greater will be its internal 
energy (thermal energy) Two bodies can 
be the same temperature and have 
different internal energy because they 
have different masses.

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
• Describe applications of 
specific heat capacity and 
specific latent heat (e.g. use of 
water as a coolant) 
• Water has a large specific heat 
capacity.  1 kg of water has to absorb 
4000J of energy to change its 
temperature by 1K.  Water is therefore 
useful as a coolant, to extinguish most 
fires, substances like metals with lower 
heat capacities may be used to make 
pots, since it requires a small amount of 
heat to cause a large temperature rise, 
so heat is not wasted on the pot itself –  
 
• The refrigerator and air conditioner 
utilize the principle of the cooling 
effect of evaporation: volatile liquids 
absorb heat to change state from liquid 
to gas, giving rise to a lower 
temperature of the surroundings.  Also, 
the gas readily loses heat to change 
back to liquid. Therefore refrigerators 
and air conditioners act as heat pumps.  
Sweating cools the body in the same 
manner.  As sweat evaporates from the 
skin, it requires energy, this energy is 
absorbed form the skin, thus lowering 
the temperature of the skin.      
 
        
Research and present applications of 
latent heat and specific heat capacity

following:  
1. Applications of the use of water in a 
car’s radiator as a coolant due to its

• Recognize that longitudinal

similar behaviours and 
obey the same laws.  
 
• Reflection of waves governed by the laws of 
reflection: the incident, normal and reflected 
waves are in the same plane and the angle of 
incidence and reflection are equal. 
• Construction of ray diagrams would show 
reflection of plane waves from plane surface. 
• Reflection of plane waves from concave and 
convex surfaces (sketches only), plane wave 
incident upon a concave surface is reflected as a 
circular wave front converging at the principal 
focus of the surface. 
• Plane wave incident upon a convex surface is 
reflected from the surface as if there is a circular 
disturbance spreading out from the virtual 
principal focus of the surface. 
• Refraction of waves follows the laws of refraction: 
(1) the incident and refracted rays are on opposite 
sides of the normal at the point of incidence and all 
3 are in the same plane, (2) Snell’s law: the ratio of 
sine the angle of incidence to sine the angle of 
refraction is a constant for a given pair of media. 
• Also refractive index of the second medium = sin i 
/ sin r, speed of wave in the first medium/speed of 
wave in the second medium, or wavelength of 
wave in the first medium / wavelength of wave in 
the second medium. 
Note that refraction causes the speed and wavelengths to 
change but the frequency remains the same.

boundaries

Convex mirrors diverge, while concave

Convex mirrors produce virtual, upright, 
diminished images and reflect a large part 
of the surroundings (i.e. they give a wide 
field view). They are therefore used as 
driving mirrors on cars and for 
surveillance e.g. in aisles of stores.

objects. They are therefore used as shaving 
mirrors, in the field of dentistry and as 
reflectors (in torchlights or vehicle 
headlamps). As parabolic mirrors, they can 
be used to obtain a parallel beam of light. 
For distant objects, concave mirrors

• Experimentally locate the 
principal focus of a concave 
mirror (rough method using 
screen)  
 
Light may be converged towards a focus 
point in front of concave mirrors. The 
principal focus of a concave mirror may 
therefore be roughly determined using a 
screen as the point where the rays appear 
to converge.

images formed by concave and 
convex mirrors.  
 
The images formed by spherical mirrors 
can be found by drawing two of the 
following rays: 
(a) A ray drawn parallel to the principal 
axis, is reflected through the principal 
focus, F. 
(b) A ray drawn through the centre of 
curvature C which hits the mirror 
normally, is reflected back along its 
own path. 
(c) A ray drawn through the principal 
focus, F is reflected parallel to the 
principal axis.

• Determine the speed of sound 
from echo experiments. 
 
 
• Sound waves travel at about 330 
m/s in air   All sounds in air at the 
same pressure and temperature 
travel at the same speed. Higher 
frequency sounds have shorter 
wavelengths and lower frequency 
sounds have longer wavelengths.    
 
• The speed of sound in a medium 
depends on the density and 
elasticity of the medium. Sound 
travels faster through denser more 
elastic materials.  
 
• If the speed of ultrasound in a 
medium is known, a pulse can be 
sent out and the time taken for that 
pulse to be received from a 
reflecting surface is noted.  The 
distance to the reflecting surface 
can be determined using distance = 
speed x time.  This echo method is 
used to estimate the depth of ocean 
floors by ships and the instrument 
is called a fathometer.  
 
• Estimate the speed of sound in air using whatever 
is available. Discuss sources of errors, ways to 
improve etc. also degree of accuracy of 
measurement of time and distance. 
• Sound waves obey the laws of reflection: place a 
ticking clock or watch in the closed end of a long 
cardboard tube. Hold the open end of the tube at 
an angle (of incidence) to a hard wall. Place 
another cardboard tube (open at both ends) to the 
wall at about the same angle, in the same plane as 
the first. Try to hear the sound made by the clock 
or watch. By trial and error using different angles, 
students should find that the sound is heard best 
when the tubes are in the same plane and the 
angle of 
incidence = the angle of reflection.

Speed of sound by echoes. Speed= distance/time.  
Measure a distance of 50m-100m at right angles

the body by a transmitter placed in 
contact with the skin.  Reflections or 
echoes are received from ant surfaces 
within the body which have different 
density, structure, or elasticity.  The time 
delay of the echoes gives the depth 
within the body of the reflecting

Total Internal Reflection can be very useful. Its 
effect is evident in prisms, optical fibres, 
periscopes, bicycle, cable television, formation of 
mirages, diamonds. 
Optical fibres are used in endoscopes and for 
telecommunications. Since light enters one end of 
the fibre, at an angle greater than the critical angle, 
total internal reflection occurs.  In endoscopes, 
other optical fibres in the bundle collect the 
reflected light using lenses and send it to a 
computer, where the information is displayed as a 
picture on a monitor.

Light undergoes successive refraction from 
cornea and is focused on retina after successive 
refractions. The retina is sensitive to light and 
sends messages to the brain by way of the optic 
nerves. Although the image on the retina is 
inverted, the brain interprets it correctly

The blind spot is the area on the retina 
without receptors that respond to light. 
Therefore an image that falls on this 
region will not be seen.

Binocular vision is vision in which 
both eyes are used together. 
Advantages include a spare eye in 
case one is damaged, a wider field of 
view, the ability to detect faint objects 
is enhanced (binocular summation) 
and precise depth perception may be 
provided by the different positions of 
the two eyes on the head.

• Draw diagrams to show eye 
defects associated with the lens 
and the use of additional lenses

Defects in vision may be eliminated by using 
spectacles, whose lenses refract light before it 
enters the eye. 
 Hypermetropia (long or farsightedness) 
occurs when near objects cannot be focused 
because the diverging rays of light are focused 
behind the retina. Only far objects are clearly 
seen. This may be caused by a short eyeball or 
weak lens. It may occur in older people since 
the refractive power of the lens decreases with 
age.   
Correction: use of a convex lens

Myopia (short or near sightedness) occurs 
when distant objects appear blurred because 
parallel light rays are refracted too much and 
become focused in front of the retina. Only 
near objects can be seen very clearly. It may 
be caused by a long eyeball, poor nutrition or 
genetic reasons.

(2) The Microscope: the objective lens, which 
is a powerful converging lens of short 
focal length, is used to produce a real 
inverted image and magnified image. The 
eyepiece lens is the lens that is nearest to 
the eye. It has a short focal length and is 
used to magnify the first image (acts as a 
magnifying glass). The combination of the 
two lenses produces a final image (I2), 
which is inverted compared to the object, 
virtual, and magnified. 
  
(3) The Telescope … uses two converging 
lens to produce an inverted virtual image. 
The objective lens is a wide aperture 
converging lens of long focal length. The 
aperture allows it to collect a lot of light 
from weak distant sources and forms a 
weak inverted diminished image (I1).  The 
eyepiece lens is a short focal length 
convex lens, which is to magnify the first 
image. The final image is inverted.

Alternating current (a.c) is an electric current 
whose magnitude and direction of flow is reversed 
in periodic cycles. Electrons first start to flow in one 
direction until the current reaches a maximum 
value, then the current slows down and stops. The 
electrons then start to flow in the opposite direction 
until the current reaches the same maximum value. 
 
GCSE physics pg. 200 
The peak voltage of an alternating current is the 
value of the crest/ peak or trough of its alternating 
waveform 
The number of cycles in one second (called the 
frequency) is given in a unit called Hertz (symbol 
Hz) where 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second.

Non-Ohmic conductors include: 
• Filament lamp..as temperature increases, 
the resistance of the filament wire 
increases and hence less current flows 
• Thermistor ... as temperature increases, 
the resistance of the thermistor decreases 
so more current flows. Thermistors are 
useful in circuits sensitive to temperature 
changes such as thermostats. 
• Light dependent resistor (LDR) ... as 
light increases, the resistance of the LDR 
decreases so more current flows. LDRs 
act as a light sensitive switches and are 
useful in light sensitive circuits such as 
burglar alarms, photographic equipment 
and automatic lighting and burglar 
alarms.

Total resistance is the 
sum of all the 
resistances.                    
(RT = R1 + R2 …) 
The reciprocal of the total 
resistance is the sum of 
the reciprocals of all the 
resistances.                           
(1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 ...)   
Current is same in all 
parts of the circuit.     
(I1 = I2 …) 
Total current in the circuit 
is split into its separate 
branches, based on the 
resistance of each branch.   
(IT =I1 + I2 …) The lower 
the resistance, the greater 
the current. Total current 
going into and leaving 
alternative branches is 
same.

Magnets may be made in the following ways: 
1. By Stroking … The act of stroking an  
un-magnetised material in one direction only, with a 
magnet, lines up each domain, so that they are all 
‘pointing’ in the same direction.  
Stroke a piece of un-magnetised

magnet. Test it to see whether it 
attracts magnetic materials and use 
a plotting compass to determine

2.   By Magnetic Induction  … In magnetic 
induction, a magnetic pole induces an unlike pole 
near to it and a similar pole away from it. When 
the ferromagnetic material is held close to a 
magnet, magnetism is induced into the material, 
allowing it to become a magnet.  This induced 
magnetism is temporary if a magnetically soft 
material is used and permanent if a magnetically 
hard material is used.  
 
 
Attract a paper clip with a bar 
magnet, then use paper clip with 
induced magnetism to attract other

3. By Electrical Method: using a Solenoid (long 
coil of wire  (to make an electromagnet)  
      An electromagnet (temporary) magnet is 
activated by an electric current. When a current 
is passed through the solenoid, it obtains a 
magnetic field (which is strongest inside the 
solenoid).  If a bar of magnetically soft iron, 
called the core, is placed inside it, a much 
stronger magnetic field is attained, enabling the 
core to become an electromagnet. 
 
The shape of the magnetic field is similar to that of a bar 
magnet and the polarity obtained by the electromagnet 
can be found by applying the Right Hand Grip Rule. 
 
The Right Hand Grip Rule: if the right hand grips the 
solenoid in the direction of the conventional current 
(positive to negative), the thumb points to the north pole.

Heating and hitting makes the particles move vigorously 
upsetting the alignment of the domains. Using an 
alternating current slowly breaks up the arrangement of 
the domains, as the current, and the direction of the 
magnetic field, are constantly changing direction. 
Domains arranged haphazardly have no overall

When a wire carrying a current is placed in a 
magnetic field, at right angles to the direction of the 
field, it experiences a force, at right angles to the 
direction of the current and the direction of the 
magnetic field. (the motor effect).  
 
When a rectangular coil carries current in a magnetic 
field, the current in the coil flows in opposite 
directions. A couple (pair of forces, equal in size but 
opposite in direction) is experienced which pushes 
one side of the coil upwards and the other side of the 
coil downwards, causing the coil to rotate.

• Solve radioactive decay problems 
based on numerical data of half-
life  
Why half-life? 
Radioactive decay is a random process.  This 
means that we cannot tell exactly when a 
particular atom will decay (i.e. its ‘life’).  An 
atom might decay in 5 minutes; its 
neighbour might decay in 5 million years. 
 
However, for a large sample of atoms of a 
given element, the time taken for half the 
sample to decay is constant.  This time is 
called the half-life of the sample. 
 
It has also been found that the rate of decay 
is proportional to the quantity of un-decayed 
atoms in a sample.  Therefore half-life can 
be determined practically by measuring the 
time taken for the rate of decay of a sample 
to drop by half. 
 
We measure rate of decay in becquerels 
(Bq), where 1 Bq = 1 decay per second.  
Decay rate is also called ‘activity’.  Another 
unit of decay rate is the curie (Ci) where 1 Ci 
= 3.7 x 1010 decays per second.  
 
Solving decay problems based on 
numerical data:To find the half-life, we 
must divide the total time of decay by the 
number of half-lives that occurred during the 
decay.  (See example on right.) 
1  Determining half-life from 
simulation 
    The simulation cited will give the 
half-life of the element (see the red 
line).  Pause the simulation when 
half of the sample has decayed.  
Read the time taken and compare it 
with the given half-life.  Do this 
several times using 10 atoms and 
find the average.  Repeat with 100 
atoms and find the average.  Do we 
get more consistent results of half-
life if the sample size is large or 
small? 
 
2  Solving decay problems based on 
numerical data 
    The initial activity of a sample is 80 
Bq.  After 500 minutes, the activity 
drops to 20 Bq.  Determine the half-
life of the sample. 
     Solution From 80 Bq to 40 Bq to 20 
Bq represents 2 half-lives.  Hence 
one half-life  =  500 mins ÷ 2  =  250 
mins.

• In 1543, the Copernican revolution, revealed that the 
earth is not the center of the universe, but a planet 
orbiting the sun. Three later figures–Tycho Brahe, 
Johannes Kepler, and Galileo–provided the key evidence 
that eventually led to wide acceptance of the Copernican 
idea. The revolution culminated with Isaac Newton’s 
uncovering of the laws of motion and gravity.

• Describe and explain how the 
cathode ray oscilloscope works 
and state common uses. 
 
In a cathode ray tube, the "cathode" , a heated 
filament, is in a vacuum created inside a glass tube. 
The "ray" is a stream of electrons that naturally pour 
off a heated cathode into the vacuum. Electrons are 
negative. The anode is positive, so it attracts the 
electrons pouring off the cathode.  In a TV's cathode 
ray tube, the stream of electrons is focused by a 
focusing anode into a tight beam and then accelerated 
by an accelerating anode. This tight, high-speed beam 
of electrons flies through the vacuum in the tube and 
hits the flat screen at the other end of the tube. This 
screen is coated with phosphor, which glows when 
struck by the beam. The image formed on this screen 
can be used in oscilloscopes, televisions, computer 
monitors and radars.  
 
A cathode ray oscilloscope is an electronic measuring 
instrument that creates a visible two-dimensional 
graph of one or more electrical potential differences. 
The horizontal axis of the display normally represents 
time, making the instrument useful for displaying 
periodic signals. The vertical axis usually shows 
voltage. The display is caused by the electron beam 
hitting the phosphor and periodically sweeping the 
screen from left to right. 
 
Oscilloscopes are used in the sciences, medicine, 
engineering, telecommunications, and industry. Some 
are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and 
laboratory work. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may 
be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive 
ignition system, or to display the waveform of the 
heartbeat as an electrocardiogram.

A simple fire alarm circuit based on a LDR and lamp 
pair could be used for sensing the fire. The alarm 
works by sensing the smoke produced during fire. The 
circuit produces an audible alarm when the fire breaks 
out with smoke. When there is no smoke the light 
from the bulb will be directly falling on the LDR. The 
LDR resistance will be low and so the voltage across 
it (below .6V).The transistor will be OFF and nothing 
happens. When there is sufficient smoke to mask the 
light from falling on LDR, the LDR resistance 
increases and so do the voltage across it. Now the 
transistor will switch to ON. This gives power to the 
IC1 and it outputs 5V.This powers the tone generator 
IC UM66 (IC2) to play a music. This music will be 
amplified by IC3 (TDA 2002) to drive the speaker.

• Add parallel forces along a 
line. 
• Determine the resultant of 
perpendicular forces 
(parallelogram law, 
Pythagoras Theorem scale 
drawings, trigonometry) 
Resultant of parallel and anti parallel 
forces. 
The resultant, F, of two parallel forces, P 
and Q, is given by: F = P + Q 
For anti-parallel forces, P and Q: F = P - Q. 
Parallelogram of forces rule 
The resultant, R, of two forces, P and Q, 
acting at an angle to each other on an object 
can be found by: 
• drawing the forces, P and Q to scale, 
acting at a point, X, and 
• completing the parallelogram 
The resultant is the diagonal of the 
parallelogram, drawn from X. 
This should help convey the idea that F is 
the resultant, and that F = P + Q. 
If a mass of known weight, W, is 
suspended by a spring balance and a 
force, P, registers on the spring, then, 
since the mass is stationary, it means that 
the net force F = 0. Therefore, for the 
two anti-parallel forces: F = P – W. 
1 Finding the resultant of two forces 
acting at an acute angle by scale 
drawing 
Students are shown how to draw 
parallelograms. Then they can be guided 
into finding the resultant (magnitude and 
direction) of a 70-N force and an 80-N 
force acting at angle of 60o between them 
2 Demonstrating resultant direction 
for mutually perpendicular forces

about the middle of a rubber band. Two 
students exert pull on the rubber band 
with forces at right angles to each other.

Resolve a force into its 
perpendicular components and

Components of a force 
Rectangular components of a force are two 
forces, acting at right angles to each other, 
that together produce the same effect as the 
single force. 
Since P and Q together produce the same 
effect as R 
in the diagram above, then P and Q are the 
components of R. 
From simple trigonometry, it can be shown 
that: 
Q = R cos θ , and P = R sin θ 
Finding the resultant of two forces 
acting at a right angle to each other 
(practical method) 
 
Three strings are tied to a form a knot at 
a point X. The free ends of the strings 
are connected to spring balances such 
that three students exert forces P, Q and 
E to keep the knot stationary. (The angle 
between the forces P and Q is kept at 
90o) 
When the knot is stationary, the 
magnitude of E is equal to the magnitude 
of R. (E is called the equilibrant, since it 
keeps the knot in equilibrium.) By 
drawing lines under the strings on a 
paper below, the direction of the resultant 
R can be obtained. 
3 Finding components 
Students can be asked to identify and 
calculate components in the following 
situations: 
• The horizontal and vertical components 
of a force of 75 N pulling at an angle of

Apply the principle of moments 
to solve problems. 
 
•  
Principle of moments 
For rotational equilibrium, the sum of the 
clockwise moments about an axis must be 
equal to the sum of the anti-clockwise 
moments about the same axis. 
Couple 
A couple is a pair of forces, equal in 
magnitude, applied on opposite sides of and 
the same distance from an axis of rotation, 
that produce the same type of moment 
(clockwise or anti-clockwise). The forces 
on the steering-wheel shown below form a 
couple. 
 
The moment of a couple in which each force 
is a distance, r, from the axis (in the 
steering-wheel, the axis is at the centre of 
the circle) is given by 
M = F r + F r = F x 2r 
Applying the principle of moments 
Types of practice exercises can include: 
. children on a see-saw 
. a wheelbarrow lifting a load 
. a crow-bar overcoming a load 
- (Note: Caution students that moment 
due to a mass is not mass x d, but 
weight x d, since moment deals with 
forces and weight, not mass, is a 
force.) 
 
Balancing moments 
1. Place a metre rule on a pivot (e.g. the 
side of a pencil) so that the ruler 
balances (approximately). Note the 
balance point and use this pivot at this 
point throughout the experiment. 
2. Place a 100-g mass on the ruler at a 
distance of 20.0 cm from the pivot. 
The ruler becomes overbalanced. 
3. Balance the ruler using 
- a smaller mass (e.g. 50 g) 
- a larger mass (e.g. 200 g)

Machine 
A machine is a device that makes doing 
work easier. This is achieved either by 
- using a small force to overcome a large 
load, or 
- applying a force from a convenient 
position 
Mechanical advantage (MA), velocity 
ratio (VR) and efficiency (Eff) of a 
machine 
- Mechanical advantage is defined as the 
ratio of the load (L) to the effort (E). 
Thus: 
MA = L / E 
- Velocity ratio is the ratio of the distance 
(xE) moved by the effort to the distance 
(xL) moved by the load in the same time. 
Thus: 
VR = xE / xL 
- Efficiency is the ratio of useful work WL 
done on the load to the work WE done by 
the effort. Thus: 
Eff = WL / WE 
(To obtain percentage efficiency, we 
multiply Eff by 100%.)

Relationship among MA, VR and Eff 
 
Since WL = L xL and WE = E xE , 
Then,   Eff   =  L xL 
= (L/E) x (xL / xE) 
                         E xE  
 
Hence, Eff = MA / VR 
 
Inclined planes 
Inclined planes make work easier by requiring a 
smaller force to overcome a larger load. See 
activity in column on right. 
 
Screws 
Screws make work easier through an effort that 
travels a large distance (the circumference of a 
circle e.g. the circumference of a screwdriver 
handle) while the load advances a tiny distance. 
This tiny distance is called the pitch (p) of the 
screw i.e. the distance between successive 
threads. Assuming an efficiency of 1, 
                  E xE = L xL  =  L p  
Hence, L / E = xE / p = 2πR / p  
Or, 
   MA 
= 2πR / p 
 
 
The idea involved in using an inclined 
plane is to raise a load (L) a certain height 
(h), by means of an effort that is smaller 
than the load. 
 
Students measure: L, E, h, θ, and xE. They 
compute MA, VR and Eff from the data. 
(Note that Eff can be calculated in two 
ways: Eff = MA/VR and Eff = L h / E xE = 
MA sinθ.) 
 
Screws 
Students observe the action of screws 
penetrating wood or car jacks. They 
identify: pitch, the radius R, the effort and 
the load.

Velocity ratio 
(Let us consider A as the driving gear.) 
When the effort at A moves 
through1revolution, the load at B makes 
2πR / 2πr revolutions i.e. R/r revolutions. 
Since number of teeth on a gear is 
proportional to the radius of the wheel, then

Thus, when A (with the larger number of 
teeth) is the driving gear, the velocity ratio 
is less than 1. 
Mechanical advantage 
For the above arrangement, assuming Eff = 
1, we get MA = VR and hence, 
MA = n/N 
The MA is less than 1, meaning that a large 
effort is applied where the gears meet to 
overcome a smaller load. As far as forces 
are concerned, this is a mechanical 
disadvantage. However, the smaller gear 
spins faster than the larger gear. 
The reverse is true. To overcome a large 
load at A, a smaller effort is applied at B. In 
other words, B must be the driving gear. A 
will spin at a slower rate than B. Bicycles 
and car engines make use of these facts.

COLLISIONS AND 
MOMENTUM 
• State the law of conservation of 
linear momentum 
• Differentiate between elastic 
and inelastic collisions 
or F α mv – mvo 
t 
Therefore 
F =  mv – mvo 
……… (2) 
t 
(since the unit of force i.e the newton is 
defined in such a way that the constant of 
proportional is 1). 
Note that equation (2) shows that if the 
change in momentum takes place in a short 
time, the force is large. That is why cars 
are built with crumple zones at the front 
and back. In a crash, the car folds and this 
increases the time taken for the car’s 
momentum to change to zero and come to 
a stop. The overall force on the car and the 
occupants therefore becomes reduced. 
From equation (2) we also get (assuming 
that the mass of the object is constant) 
F = m( v – vo ) , that is, F = ma 
t 
which is the equation for Newton’s Second 
Law in terms of acceleration.

Law of Conservation of Momentum 
In any system where there is no net

Elastic and Inelastic collision 
In all collisions involving no net external 
force, momentum is conserved. 
In an elastic collision, kinetic energy is 
also conserved. Thus total KE before 
collision = total KE after collision.  That is 
½ mA v  2  + ½m  v  2  =   ½m   (v  ’)2 + ½

• Car a collides with car B 
• A person jumping from a small boat 
Students can be shown how to calculate: 
1. final velocity of one object or of two 
objects (if they stick together); 
2.initial and final KE of the system and 
hence determining if the collision is 
elastic or inelastic.

Power 
• Manipulate and use the 
equation:                   
    Power = 
 
 
• Manipulate and use the 
equation:                   
    Power = force x velocity 
 
 
 
Power 
Power is the rate of doing work or converting energy.  
Thus, power, P = work done, W (or energy converted, E) 
divided by the time taken, t.  In terms of an equation:  
P  =  W/t  (or  P  =  E/t) 
Power is measured in joules per second.  1 J/s is called a 
watt (W).      
 
Power is the product of force and velocity;  
since, P = W/t  and W = Fd  
therefore  
 
P =  Fx d/t  i.e. P = Fv   
Large amounts of power is measured in horsepower (hp). 
 
I hp = 746 watts 
 
 
Efficiency 
The efficiency (Eff) of an energy conversion is defined 
by: 
Eff  =  Useful work done   x  100% ….. (6) 
           Total work put in 
 
Energy conversions are never 100% efficient, since some 
of the energy put in is invariably wasted as heat or some 
other form of energy. 
Measurement of power 
-  The teacher can demonstrate 
how to measure power of a 
small motor lifting a mass a 
height, h. (P  =  mgh /t) 
-  The class can calculate the 
power of a student of mass m by 
measuring his/her mass and 
time taken to walk up a flight of 
stairs of vertical height, h, at 
normal pace. (Note:  In the 
interest of safety, do NOT let 
the student run up the stairs!) 
 
Problem Solving  
Calculation of Power: 
What must the power output be of 
an elevator motor that can lift a 
mass of 1250 kg and gives the 
elevator a constant speed of 5 m/s. 
 
Calculation of efficiency 
 -  e.g.  the efficiency of a pulley 
system if a 100 N force, applied 
using a rope pulled a distance of 
1.2 m, lifts a 20 kg mass a height 
of 40 cm. (Discuss the apparent

PROJECTILE MOTION  
• State examples of projectile 
motion in everyday life. 
(sports- shot putt, soccer, 
discus, missiles) 
• Show experimentally that the 
horizontal and vertical motion 
are independent (drop an object 
vertically while projecting 
another horizontally, note time 
taken by each to drop.)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Projectile motion 
A projectile is any object that is either launched 
horizontally or at an angle to the horizontal. 
The forces acting on the object are the force of 
gravity and the force of friction or drag (which 
we will ignore). 
 
In projectile motion, horizontal velocity 
remains constant (assuming negligible friction 
through the air).  The vertical motion is just like 
free-fall; the object accelerates downward with 
the acceleration due to gravity.  The two 
motions are independent of each other and can 
be treated separately. 
 
1  Discussion 
Discuss with the class whether the 
following are examples  of projectiles 
or not as they move through the air; 
- shot putt ball 
- soccer ball 
- high jumper 
- long jumper 
- discus 
- airplane  
- rocket taking off 
- other examples from students 
 
2  Demonstration 
Have two students each hold an 
object, A and B, of the same size (e.g. 
small block of wood, a tennis ball or a 
pencil) at the same height.  A third 
student counts down 3 – 2 – 1- 0.  At 
zero, one throws the object 
horizontally while the other drops the 
object – at the same time.  The rest of 
the students note whether A falls first, 
B falls first, or they fall together.  The 
experiment is repeated about 3 times 
and the class results tallied and 
discussed.  (They take the same time 
to reach the floor if the object thrown 
forward is thrown horizontally

• Investigate how the range of 
a projectile varies with angle 
of projection. (Catapult 
expt.)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Projectile motion:  vertical velocity, vy ,  increases; 
horizontal velocity, vx , remains constant.  The time taken 
to fall a distance is equal to the time taken to cover a 
horizontal distance. 
 
Objects projected at an angle 
When an object is projected with an initial velocity of v0 
at an angle θ0 to the horizontal, it travels in a parabolic 
path. 
 
-the initial horizontal velocity vx0 = v0 cosθ0, this velocity 
remains constant throughout  
- the initial vertical velocity vy0 = v0 sinθ0, this velocity vy  
decreases until it reaches its maximum height, at which 
point vy = 0. As the object moves downward vy increases.

speed of 5.0 m/s from a 4.0 m hign 
tree. 
(a)  How much time is the tiger in 
the air?  (Use y  =  ½ gt2) 
(b)  How far from the base of the 
tree does the tiger land?  (Use x  =  
vxt)

ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 
• Perform experiments to 
demonstrate atmospheric 
pressure  
 
 
• Describe how atmospheric 
pressure varies with height and 
from day to day e.g. weather 
systems  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pressure of the atmosphere 
The weight of air above the Earth exerts a 
pressure on all objects on the Earth.  This 
pressure is called atmospheric pressure.  We 
shall use the symbol, Po, to represent this 
pressure.  On the average, at sea-level,  
Po  =  1.01  x  105 N/m2  
 
As we go higher up the atmosphere, there is 
less air above us.  Hence the pressure of the 
atmosphere gets less.  Thus, the atmospheric 
pressure on mountain tops is lower than the 
pressure at sea level. 
 
The pressure of the atmosphere varies from 
day to day, due to factors such as 
temperature.  When the atmospheric pressure 
is high, the weather tends to be fair or sunny.  
A low pressure is usually associated with 
rainy conditions. 
 
Some parts of the atmosphere may also be at 
high pressures and others at low pressures.  
Winds rush from areas of high pressure to 
areas of low pressure, sometimes giving rise 
to hurricanes. 
Weather stations usually measure pressures 
in milli-bars, where 1 bar = 1.01 x  105 N/m2.  
There are 1000 milli-bars in 1 bar.  
Demonstrating atmospheric pressure 
Fill a cup (or plastic bottle) with water 
(diagram 1). 
Place a smooth cardboard over the mouth 
of the filled cup of water so there are no air 
spaces between the cardboard and the 
water.  Press the cardboard in place with 
your fingers (diagram 2). 
Invert the cup with your fingers on the 
cardboard, then remove your fingers.  The 
cardboard remains in place and water does 
not run out of the cup.  Ask students why.  
(The pressure of the atmosphere presses on 
the cardboard and keeps it in place.) 
 
 
Making and using a simple barometer 
Students can make a simple barometer by 
following instructions on the link below.  
Students can calibrate their barometers on 
a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being low pressure and 
5 being high pressure.  They can make 
measurements just before rain, just after 
rain and when it is sunny.  They can also 
make charts of atmospheric pressure 
variations at regular intervals throughout a 
day.

Aneroid barometers have a sealed, air-tight flat 
metal box inside which is sensitive to changes in 
atmospheric pressure. When the gas pressure 
inside the curved metal tube increases, it tries to 
straighten out. Any increase in pressure squashes 
the box very slightly which is magnified by a 
system of levers is to be seen clearly. The end of 
the tube is linked to a pointer which reads 
pressure on a circular scale. 
 
Aneroid barometers are suitable for use in gas 
pressure gauges which are fitted to gas cylinders 
and gas laws apparatus.  They are also used as 
altimeters in aircraft as their scales can be 
calibrated in height above sea level based on the 
reduction in atmospheric pressure with 
increasing height.

kept constant. 
This can expressed as follows:

CHARLES’ LAW 
• Relate volume of a fixed mass 
of gas to its’ absolute

pressure (Charles’ Law)  
• Express relationship between 
volume and absolute 
temperature of a fixed mass of 
gas at constant pressure, as an

( V1 / T1 = V2 / T2)  
• Make graphical representations 
of the relationships between 
volume, temperature and

Charles’ Law 
According to Charles’ Law: 
The volume, V, of a fixed mass of gas is 
directly proportional to its absolute 
temperature, T, providing the pressure is 
kept constant. 
This can expressed as follows: 
V  α  T , or 
V  =  constant  x  T,  or 
V /T  =  constant, and therefore, 
V1/T1  =   V2/T2 …….  (2)

PRESSURE LAW 
 
• Express relationship between 
pressure and absolute 
temperature of a fixed mass of 
gas when volume is constant, as 
an equation and use equation to 
solve problems. ( P1 / T1 = P2 / 
T2)  
• Relate pressure of a fixed mass 
of gas to its absolute 
temperature when volume is 
constant. (Pressure Law)  
• Express absolute zero in 
Kelvins and degrees Celsius. 
• Make graphical representations 
of the relationships between 
volume, temperature and 
pressure for each gas law. 
 
Pressure Law 
According to the Pressure Law: The pressure, 
P, of a fixed mass of gas is directly 
proportional to its absolute temperature, T, 
providing the volume is kept constant. 
This can expressed as follows: 
P  α  T , or 
P  =  constant  x  T,  or 
P/T  =  constant, and therefore, 
P1/T1  =   P2/T2 …….  (3)

-273 oC                       0 oC                    θ oC   
As with Charles’ Law, the graph of pressure 
against Celsius temperature implies that, upon 
extrapolation, there is an absolute zero of 
temperature at -273 oC. 
If the temperature of -273 oC is called zero, and 
if 1 Celsius degree change is the same as 1 
Kelvin change, then Kelvin temperature, T is 
given by T(K)  =  θ (oC)  +  273 ……  (4) 
Temperatures on the constant volume gas 
thermometer are based on the Pressure Law, 
since pressure is directly proportional to 
(absolute) temperature.  
Pressure Law experiment  
The teacher can carry out an experiment to 
investigate the Pressure Law, using the 
equipment described on the right.   
 
Discussion of Pressure Law graph 
The teacher discusses the graph shown on 
the left with the students.  The graph implies 
that, upon extrapolation, there is an absolute 
zero of temperature at -273 oC. 
 
Temperatures on the constant volume gas 
thermometer are based on the Pressure Law, 
since pressure is directly proportional to 
(absolute) temperature.  The constant-
volume gas thermometer is deemed the most 
accurate thermometer since the behaviour of 
the gas in the thermometer is in conformity 
with the Kinetic Theory of gases.

COMBINED GAS LAW 
• Express the relationship 
between volume, pressure and 
temperature of a gas when 
number of particles is constant, 
as the general gas law equation 
and use this equation to solve 
problems                                       
(P1V1 / T1 =  P2V2 / T2)  
 
Predict changes in gas pressure 
due to changes in temperature, 
volume and number of particles 
(observe models)   
According to the Combined Gas Law: 
The (pressure x volume)/absolute 
temperature of a fixed mass of gas is 
constant. 
This can be expressed as follows: 
PV/T  =  constant, and therefore 
P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2  …… (5) 
It can be shown also that 
PV  =  nRT …………………..(6) 
for n moles of any gas, where R is the gas 
constant, given by,  R  =  8.31 J/mol.K.

A solar water heating panel is a successful 
radiant energy absorber, used by some 
houses and hotels in the Caribbean.  
The transparent cover traps solar radiation in 
the manner is a greenhouse and a black 
surface improves the rate of absorption of 
radiation. Water pumped through a network 
of pipes in the panel absorbs heat energy and 
carries it to a heat exchanger. Here the heat 
is passed on to the hot water pipes in the  
house. 
A simple solar water heater for homes needs 
neither a heat exchanger nor a water pump. 
The solar panels are connected directly to a 
storage tank placed about 0.5 m above the 
panels. In thermo-syphon systems, 
convection currents carry the heated water 
up to the tank and cold water down to the 
solar panels.

wavelength of UV radiation  
• Construct models to

• Discuss the greenhouse effect 
and its implications for global 
warming. Critically analyze 
choices which contribute to 
global warming,

The Bahamas. 
Short-wavelength radiation from the sun enters 
the earth’s atmosphere. The earth absorbs 
some of this radiation. The radiation that is re-
emitted by the Earth is long-wavelength infra-
red. This heat is absorbed and trapped by 
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 
such as water vapour, methane, ozone, nitrous 
oxide and chlorofluorocarbons. The energy 
produced is then reflected back to the earth, 
which then heats up. This is known as the 
greenhouse effect. 
 
Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse 
gases have increased significantly due to 
human activities (fossil fuel combustion, 
deforestation, coal mining, drilling for oil and 
natural gas, decomposition of garbage in 
landfills). 
The greenhouse effect could result in global 
warming/ climate change, melting of polar 
icecaps, sheets, and glaciers, increase in sea 
levels causing floods and submergence of low-
lying areas, ocean acidification, biodiversity 
changes, -more frequent and intense storms

Define and demonstrate 
interference of waves  
• Interference of waves: interference is the 
name given to the effects which occur 
when two separate wave fronts overlap. 
Waves pass through each other and 
merge or combine their effects.  The 
ability of waves to combine is called 
superposition and the effects of the 
combination are called interference.  
• The principle of superposition of waves:  
the displacement of any particle caused 
by overlapping waves is the sum of the 
separate displacements caused by each 
wave at a particular moment. 
• Constructive interference: when 2 waves 
meet, and the vibrations are in phase 
(particles move in the same direction at 
same time) the amplitude at that point 
increases. 
• Destructive interference: when 2 waves 
meet and the vibrations are out of phase 
(particles move in opposite directions at 
that time), the amplitude becomes 
smaller.

• Observe and sketch diagrams 
to show diffraction of water 
waves in ripple tank by setting 
up gaps of various sizes and

pass through the gaps. 
 
• Diffraction: the spreading out of waves 
around corners and edges of barriers.  
The ratio of the wavelength of the wave 
to the width of the opening indicates the 
extent of the diffraction (spreading out).  
    Wider gaps produce less diffraction.  
 
• The diffraction increases becoming more 
circular as the ratio increases.  When the 
ratio is equal to 1, there is maximum 
diffraction.  The smaller the ratio, the 
less the diffraction.

A motor is a rotating device, which converts 
electrical energy into mechanical/ kinetic energy. 
Electric motors create motion from an electric 
current.   
 
A simple direct current (d.c.) motor consists of a 
rectangular coil of wire mounted on an axle 
allowing it to rotate between the poles of a c-
shaped magnet. Two carbon brushes are connected 
to an electrical supply. The two ends of the coil 
are soldered to the two halves of a copper split 
ring commutator, which reverses the current 
direction in the coil on each half cycle, ensuring 
that the motion of the coil is continuous.  
A couple is formed on each side of the coil which 
causes the coil to rotate.  The momentum of the 
coil keeps it moving round, even when the coil is 
in the vertical position and brushes in space 
between the commutator halves. The two 
commutator halves automatically change contact 
from one brush to the other, which reverses the 
direction of the forces on the sides of the coil.

mechanical energy, which vibrates air molecules 
producing sound. When a current is passed

• The rotation of the coil is resisted by two spiral 
springs (called hairsprings) and the coil comes 
to rest when the couple turning it is balanced 
by an opposing couple from the springs. 
 
• The higher the current the greater the deflection 
of the coil (the angle turned) and the further the 
pointer moves on the scale. 
 
Electric meter has a linear scale, with numbers 
evenly spaced. The deflection of the pointer is 
therefore directly proportional to the current. The 
linear scale is achieved by: 
 Hooke’s Law  and 
 The radial magnetic field (i.e. the field lines are 
directed to the centre of the cylinder). The coils 
turn in a radial magnetic field of constant 
strength. This is achieved by using curved 
(concave) poles with a cylinder of soft iron 
fixed between them.  
 
The sensitivity of a galvanometer (i.e. the 
deflection per unit current) is increased by: 
1. increasing the number of turns on the coil 
2. using a stronger magnet 
3. using weaker hairsprings or wire suspension 
(so that springs must be turned  
       further to produce any given opposing couple) 
4. using a long beam of light reflected from a 
mirror on the coil  as a pointer.

Electromagnetic induction 
• Explain electromagnetic 
induction as an energy transfer 
process  
 
Electromagnetic induction is an energy 
transfer process whereby mechanical/ kinetic 
energy is converted to electrical energy. 
Electro-magnetic induction is the process 
whereby an electromotive force (e.m.f.) or 
voltage is induced when a conductor moves 
relative (at right angle) to a magnetic field. If 
the circuit is a complete one, then a current is 
also induced.

• Describe and demonstrate the 
induction of an e.m.f. (and 
hence current in a complete 
circuit) based on the relative 
motion of a conductor 
perpendicular to a magnetic 
field (& motion of magnet in 
solenoid)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
An electromotive force (e.m.f.) or voltage is 
induced when a conductor moves at right angles 
to a magnetic field. The changing magnetic field 
causes the electrons to start moving. 
 
A voltage can be induced if a magnet is dipped 
into a coil or solenoid. As a magnet is moved into 
the coil, the coil cuts field lines all around the 
magnet, and a current is induced

determine direction of induced 
voltage (current) in a conductor 
moving in a magnetic field.  
The direction of the induced current for a straight 
conductor can be predicted using Fleming’s Right 
Hand Rule.  
If the thumb, the first finger, and the second finger 
of the right hand are held at right angles to each 
other, then; the first finger points in the direction of 
the Field (N to S), the second finger points in the 
direction of conventional Current (+ve  to –ve), the 
thumb points in the direction of the Motion of the 
conductor.

• The strength of the magnetic field (the stronger 
the magnetic field, the bigger the induced 
e.m.f.) 
• The number of turns of coil for solenoids (the 
greater the number of coils, the bigger the 
e.m.f.). 
• The speed at which wire cuts through the 
conductor or solenoid (the greater the speed, 
the greater the induced e.m.f.) 
• The type of core (a soft iron core increases the 
value of the e.m.f. since soft iron concentrates 
field lines and makes an electro-magnet.

• Describe and demonstrate 
applications of electromagnetic 
induction in alternators (a.c. 
generators) and (d.c  
generators/dynamos, Eddy- 
heating stoves, furnaces )  
 
A generator is a machine which converts rotational 
(mechanical) energy into electrical energy. 
A generator consists of loops or coils of wire, which 
rotates in a magnetic field. As the coil(s) rotates, it 
cuts the magnetic field and a voltage is induced 
across it. This voltage causes a current to flow.  
• In a.c. generators (alternators), slip rings are 
connected to carbon brushes. The reason the slip 
rings are used is so that the wire does not get 
tangled when it rotates.  
• In d.c. generators or dynamos, the slip ring is 
segmented (i.e. split ring commutator is used like 
the electric motor).

A transformer changes the voltage of an alternating 
current without changing the frequency of the 
supply.  
Transformers 
operate 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
electromagnetic induction. When an alternating p.d. 
is applied to the primary coils, the resulting current 
produces a large alternating magnetic field or flux 
which reaches the secondary coils and induces an 
e.m.f. in it.  
The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. depends on: 
(1) 
the p.d. applied to the primary and  
(2) 
the relative number of turns Np and Ns, 
comprising  the primary and secondary 
coils, respectively.

SOME CAUSES OF 
POWER LOSS  
IN TRANSFORMERS 
DESIGN FEATURES TO 
REDUCE POWER LOSS 
(INCREASE EFFICIENCY) 
Heating effect of the current 
in the wires of the coils.  
(power loss in each coil = 
I2R where R is the resistance 
of the wire in each loop) 
Thick copper wire of low 
resistance 
Heating effect of “eddy” 
currents (swirling, circular 
current) induced in the iron 
core.  
(power loss in each coil = 
I2R where R is the resistance 
of a closed loop in the iron 
core where eddy currents 
flow) 
The iron core is laminated 
(layered) cutting across the 
path of any eddy current. The 
high resistance between the 
laminations greatly reduces the 
eddy currents and the heat they 
would produce. 
Energy is used in the process 
of magnetizing the iron core 
and reversing the 
magnetization every time the 
current reverses. This energy 
appears as heat.  
The core is made of soft iron 
which is very easily 
magnetised and demagnetized 
by the magnetic field of the 
primary coil. 
Some of the magnetic field 
lines produced by the 
primary coil do not link with 
the secondary coil, reducing 
the e.m.f. in the secondary 
coil.  
The core is designed for 
maximum linkage between the 
primary and secondary coils. 
The common method is to 
wind the secondary coil over 
the primary coil. The iron core 
must always be in the form of 
a closed loop.

The transformer is said to be a step-up one if ns is 
greater than np. The voltage in the secondary coil 
exceeds that on the primary if there are more turns 
on the secondary coil, the current in the secondary 
is less than in the primary since power is same. 
The transformer is said to be a step-down one if ns 
is less than np. The voltage in the secondary coil is 
less than in the primary if there are fewer turns on 
the secondary coil, but the current in the secondary 
is greater than in the primary.

• Describe common uses of 
transformers ( in the home, 
long distance transmission of 
power-national grid). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transformers are used for long distance 
transmission of electrical power. The National 
Grid system uses high voltages in power cables 
to save on energy losses. The high voltages are 
produced using step-up transformers, and at the 
end of the line, step-down transformers in 
substations are used to bring the voltage down to 
120V. 
Energy could be lost due to: 
1. heat loss due to resistance in coils 
2. leakage of magnetic field lines between 
primary and secondary coils 
3. heat loss due to eddy currents induced in iron 
core 
4. the flipping of magnetic dipoles in the iron 
core due to the a.c. 
Other uses of transformers include  
• To get low voltages from the mains 120V 
a.c., e.g. for radios. 
• To get high voltages from the mains, e.g. for 
TV.

• Explain the importance of 
electrical safety in buildings 
and describe how fuses and 
circuit breakers are used to 
protect from circuit 
overloads and short circuits     
 
• Justify why fuses, circuit 
breakers, cables must have a 
suitable current rating for a 
given use.  
 
 
 
A circuit breaker is an automatically-operated 
electrical switch designed to protect an electrical 
circuit from damage caused by overload or short 
circuit. 
Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, 
by interrupting continuity, to immediately 
discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which 
operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit 
breaker can be reset (either manually or 
automatically) to resume normal operation.  
Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from 
small devices that protect an individual household 
appliance up to large switchgear designed to 
protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. 
A fuse is a type of sacrificial overcurrent 
protection device. Its essential component is a 
metal wire or strip that melts when too much 
current flows, which interrupts the circuit in which 
it is connected. Short circuit, overload or device 
failure is often the reason for excessive current. 
Sources:  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_%28electrical%
29 
Fuses, circuit breakers and cables should always have 
amperage rating a little higher than the appliance that they 
are connected to. As a general multiply the amperage of the 
appliance by 1.25 to calculate the rating of the fuse, circuit 
breaker or cable to use, eg. if an appliance requires 20 amp 
use a 25 ampere fuse

hazardous voltages. 
 
Insulation on current-carrying wires is 
protect the user from coming into direct 
contact with electric current, thus avoiding 
harm. 
 
Double insulation protects the user of the 
appliance from an electrical shock by 
preventing any possibility of the external 
casing becoming live (the live wire cannot 
touch the casing even if wires inside become 
loose), thus eliminating the need for an earth 
connection e.g. electric kettles and hair 
dryers 
 
To avoid overheating and possibly fires, the

• Interpret electricity bills and 
perform calculations of the 
cost of electrical energy in 
joules and kilowatt-hours 
[Energy consumption = 
Power (kilowatt) x time (h) 
 
Cost = kWh x cost per unit 
(i.e. cost per kWh)] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      Energy = Power(kilowatt-hour) x time(h) 
 
For example: If a 500 W freezer is left on 
continuously for 3 weeks then the energy it 
consumes during that time is: 
Energy = (500W/1000W/kW) x (3 weeks x      
                 2352h/week) 
              = 3528 kWh   
Note if a freezer is on for 3 weeks, it will not be 
using 1000W of power for the full 3 weeks.  
 
kWh = (1kW x 1000W/kW) x (1h x 3600s/h) 
             = 3 600 000 Ws = 3 600 000J 
The kilowatt-hour is the SI unit for electrical 
energy. 
 
This conversion factor of 1kWh/ 3 600 000J can 
be used to interconvert between Kilowatt-hour 
and Joule 
 
In the above example if a utility company 
charges 10¢ per kilowatt-hour the cost of running 
the freezer for 3 weeks would be: 
Cost = 10¢/kilowatt-hour x 3528 kWh 
         = 3 528¢ = $35.28

• Discuss ways of conserving 
electrical energy in homes 
(reducing wastage).  
 
 
 
Energy saving tips for homes and offices include: 
 Computer: Keep the monitor and the 
computer switched off when not in use  
 Light bulbs: As a power-saving measure, use 
energy efficient lamps such as LEDs since 
their power rating is less, less energy is used 
in a given time 
 Air Conditioning: Put the temperature at the 
minimum or maximum strongest you are 
comfortable with, depending on the season. to 
conserve energy, try not to put it at too high or 
too low temperatures.  
 Washers: Minimize the number of washings 
– wash a full load of garments when possible. 
 Television: Unplug the power plug of your 
television set when not using it.  
 Water Heater: use energy efficient heaters 
and keep the thermostat at the minimal heat.  
 Refrigerator: Bring cooked food to room 
temperatures before placing it into the 
refrigerator. Also bring cold or frozen food 
out of the freezer a great deal ahead of the 
mealtime, thereby conserving energy in 
heating it.

7   ENERGY FROM THE 
NUCLEUS 
 
• Distinguish between nuclear 
fission and nuclear fusion (with 
the use of equations)  
 
• Recognize that energy released 
from fission or fusion is 
obtained from mass being 
converted to energy according 
to E = mc2.  
 
• Explain how nuclear chain 
reactions occur.(including 
criteria for sustained chain 
reactions-purity of radioactive 
fuel, critical mass- the 
minimum amount of substance 
required for a sustained chain 
reaction)   
 
 
 
 
 
Albert Einstein and  E  =  mc2 
In 1905, Einstein proposed the mass-energy 
equivalence equation, E  =  mc2  
 
Energy by nuclear fusion 
In nuclear fusion, two light nuclei (e.g. 
hydrogen-2, also called ‘deuterium’) are made 
to collide and fuse.  Energy is released, as the 
equation shows below: 
  21 H   +   21 H                32 He + 10 n  +  energy 
It has not yet been possible to control nuclear 
fusion so that energy can be obtained at a safe 
rate. The sun produces energy through a process 
called nuclear fusion. This is the process of 
combining nuclei to make a nucleus with a 
greater number of protons or neutrons. The 
nuclear fusion in the sun is summarized below  
 
 
Energy by nuclear fission 
Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz 
Straussmann demonstrated that a large 
nucleus (e.g. 23592 U), when bombarded with a 
slow-moving neutron, broke into two large 
pieces (i.e. underwent fission) and released, 
not only other neutrons, but also large 
amounts of energy. 
The equation for this reaction is shown below: 
23592 U  + 10 n           14456 Ba +  9036 U  + 2 10 n 
+ energy

4   Calculating energy released 
from a nuclear reaction 
     By inserting atomic masses in 
the fission equation shown in 
column 2, it can be shown 
that the total mass on the 
right is less than the total 
mass on the left.  The mass 
that has ‘disappeared’ has 
been converted into energy 
which can be calculated 
using   E = mc2.

Chain reaction 
The 2 neutrons liberated in the above reaction 
could produce fission in other uranium-235 
nuclei present, resulting in a chain reaction, 
since these nuclei would also be liberating 
neutrons during fission. 
  However, the fuel ore is a mixture of 
uranium-235 (which undergoes fission) and 
uranium-238 (which does not).  To sustain a 
chain reaction, there must be enough of 
uranium-235 atoms i.e. a critical mass of 
uranium-235 present.  That is why the ore 
must be purified (using centrifuges) so as to 
increase the percentage of uranium-235 
present in the fuel such that a critical mass of 
uranium-235 is present.

Nuclear power plant The main design 
features are described in Physics for CSEC, by 
Farley and Trotz, pp 538-539 as follows: 
 
-  The reactor (fuel rods are used rather than 
one block of ore to reduce the chance of an 
uncontrolled nuclear reaction;   
- the moderator slows down the neutrons so 
that they can be captured by the uranium-
235 nuclei;  
- the control rods are raised or lowered to 
control the number of neutrons reaching the 
fuel, and hence the rate of the reaction rate; 
- the coolant carries heat generated in the 
core to the heat exchanger;   
- the pressure vessel  is made of steel to 
withstand pressures built up in the reactor;  
- the concrete casing is there in case pressure 
builds up in the reactor and also serves a 
shield preventing radiation from escaping 
to the environment). 
 
-  The heat exchanger receives heat from the 
reactor via the coolant and uses this heat 
energy to convert water into steam at high 
pressure; The steam from the exchanger 
causes the steam turbine to spin.  
- The spinning turbine is connected to a 
generator which converts the rotational 
kinetic energy of the turbine into electrical 
energy

8  THE NUCLEAR 
ENERGY DEBATE 
• Critically analyse the use 
of nuclear energy as an 
alternative source of 
energy  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
World’s current dependence on fossil fuel 
energy 
-  The world is currently heavily dependent 
(approximately 90%) on fossil fuels for its 
energy.  
-   With more countries undergoing development, 
with world population growing and therefore 
with more demands for energy, the fossil fuel 
supplies are expected to run out soon (oil, for 
example, in about 100 years’ time) 
-  Fossil fuels also produce severe pollution when 
used (and even when spilled during 
transportation) 
 
The nations of the world are therefore stepping 
up development of other sources of energy.  One 
such source is nuclear energy 
 
Nuclear energy as a source 
It is estimated that the known reserves of nuclear 
fissionable material will last for a few hundred 
years.  This time could be extended to about a 
thousand years using ‘breeder’ reactors. 
 
However, dangers are involved in every stage of 
obtaining this energy:  mining the ore, 
transporting the ore, refining the ore, using the 
ore in the reactor and getting rid of nuclear 
waste.

to a secondary mirror which lies in front of it and 
further reflects the light to a focus at the place 
where the eye or instruments can observe it. 
 
Refracting telescopes use transparent glass lenses 
to focus light from distant objects. 
 
The Hubble space telescope is the most famous 
observatory in space. 
Using a concave mirror and a

• Describe the structure of a 
semiconductor diode (p-type,       
n-type semiconductors). 
 
 
 
• Perform experiments to show 
that current passes basically in 
one direction through a 
semiconductor diode. 
 
A diode is a device that blocks current in one direction while 
letting current flow in another direction. Diodes can be used in 
a number of ways. For example, a device that uses batteries 
often contains a diode that protects the device if you insert the 
batteries backward. Semi-conducting diodes are semi-
conductors of the p-type or n-type, typically made silicon mixed 
with small amounts of impurities. 
 Silicon is a nonmetal because all four of its outer electrons are 
involved in perfect covalent bonds, so they can't move around. 
A pure silicon crystal is nearly an insulator -- very little 
electricity will flow through it. The behaviour of silicon can be 
changed into a conductor by doping it, In doping, a small 
amount of an impurity is mixed into the silicon crystal. 
There are two types of impurities:  
• N-type - In N-type doping, phosphorus or arsenic is added to 
the silicon in small quantities. Phosphorus and arsenic each 
have five outer electrons, so they're out of place when they get 
into the silicon lattice. The fifth electron has nothing to bond to, 
so it's free to move around. It takes only a very small quantity 
of the impurity to create enough free electrons to allow an 
electric current to flow through the silicon. N-type silicon is a 
good conductor. Electrons have a negative charge, hence the 
name N-type.  
• P-type - In P-type doping, boron or gallium is the dopant. 
Boron and gallium each have only three outer electrons. When 
mixed into the silicon lattice, they form "holes" in the lattice 
where a silicon electron has nothing to bond to. The absence of 
an electron creates the effect of a positive charge, hence the 
name P-type. Holes can conduct current. P-type silicon is a 
good conductor.  
    When the N-type and P-type are put together, interesting 
behavior at the junction occurs, which represents what happens 
in a diode.

 
 When voltage is applied across a diode in 
such a way that the diode allows current, the 
diode is said to be forward-biased. The 
voltage dropped across a conducting, forward-
biased diode is called the forward voltage. 
Silicon diodes have a forward voltage of 
approximately 0.7 volts.

a way that the diode prohibits current, the 
diode is said to be reverse-biased. The ability 
of a diode to withstand reverse-bias. Voltage is 
limited, as it is for any insulator. If the applied 
reverse-bias voltage becomes too great, the 
diode will experience a condition known as 
breakdown (Figure above), which is usually 
destructive.

 Diode symbol: 
 
 During the first half cycle of the waveform 
shown in the left hand diagram (AC), the 
diode is forward biased and current flows 
around the circuit formed by the diode, the 
transformer winding and the load  
 Since the current through the load, and the 
voltage across the load are in the same 
proportions, then the voltage across the load 
is as shown in the right hand diagram, during 
the first half cycle. 
 During the second half cycle, the diode is 
reverse biased and no current flows. This is 
indicated by the horizontal line in the right 
hand diagram. 
  The diode only conducts on every other half 
cycle. Hence the name half-wave 
rectification.  
 The rectified voltage is DC (it is always 
positive in value). However, it is not a steady 
DC but PULSATING DC. It needs to be 
smoothed before it becomes useful. 
 
Half-wave rectification can be 
demonstrated using an AC source,

much smaller and contain no filament. Instead 
of a filament, an LED creates light using 
nothing but the movement of electricity along 
the path of its semiconductor. As the electrons 
stream across the semiconductor, they create 
electromagnetic radiation. This can be of 
infrared, ultraviolet or in the form of visible 
light, which humans can perceive. LEDs have 
may uses, which include: they form the 
numbers on digital clocks, transmit 
information from remote controls, light up 
watches and tell you when your appliances are 
turned on. Collected together, they can form 
images on a jumbo television screen or

two contacts become magnetized and attracted to 
each other allowing an electrical current to pass 
through. When the magnet is moved away from the 
reed switch the contacts demagnetize, separate, 
and move to their original position. Reed switches 
commonly used in door and window sensors in
