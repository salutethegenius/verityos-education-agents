Message from Acting Assistant Director of Education (Science and Technology Section) 
 
 
What helps students to develop a scientific outlook, are the processes to which they are exposed in the classroom.  Science, therefore, should not be merely a study of 
finite answers but rather an application of processes that aid in discovering and learning about the world in which we live. 
 
If our education system is to keep pace with scientific advancement, our students must be exposed to an effective and comprehensive science education programme 
which presents opportunities for them to become actively involved in experiments, discovery and at the same time obtain the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes 
necessary to compete both locally and globally in a scientific and technological society. 
 
For this to be realized, developing and implementing model science curricula, strengthening the capacity of teachers and providing adequate science instructional 
supplies and facilities are paramount. 
 
Science teachers are therefore challenged to inspire, stimulate divergent thinking and provide the means for students to investigate based on what they know as well as 
what they wish to discover. 
 
With each of us giving of and performing at our best, our students should be able to achieve our goal, which is, to develop competent citizens who will provide an 
efficient and effective workforce needed to advance scientific careers and professions so as to improve the quality of life for all.

Message from Education Officer (High School Sciences) 
 
 
 
“What is the main purpose of schooling?” This question has engaged persons from every age-group and stratum of society, in enthusiastic discussions over the years. 
Central to all opinions on the matter is the determination of what knowledge, skills and attitudes students should acquire through formal schooling.    
 
Teachers are required to fashion their instructions based on guidelines provided in curricula which have traditionally been content or knowledge-focused. In this the 
“information age”, formal schooling is more challenged than at any era previously, to keep pace with informal education received by students via the electronic media. It 
is therefore commendable that this document includes the use of electronic media as a means of instruction.  
 
All persons using the curriculum whether trained teachers, tutors or parents, are strongly urged to become thoroughly familiar with the Introduction before using it. In so 
doing, use of the document will give focus to students assuming responsibility for their learning, their development of skills and appropriate attitudes as well as 
knowledge. The increased use of group activities and cooperative learning strategies is intended to prepare students for the trend towards team-work in the job market.  
 
Toddlers naturally exhibit scientific investigative skills as a means of gaining knowledge. The 2010 high school science curricula have been designed to assist students in 
sharpening those skills, which might have been abandoned long ago, in order to gain the knowledge deemed to be essential. Further activities included, are intended to 
encourage them to become responsible citizens as well as lifelong learners.  
 
Commendations are extended to the members of the Curriculum Development Committee. It is my hope that students enjoy the learning experiences outlined as much as 
teachers did (during the summer workshop) using the lessons included in the curriculum. I look forward to increased student engagement and enjoyment during 
instructional activities with concomitant  improvement in their academic performance.

MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of the Department of Education is to provide all persons in The Bahamas an opportunity to receive an education that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, 
attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic, Christian society. 
 
 
THE PHILOSOPHY 
 
The Department of Education embraces a philosophy that all human beings have an undeniable right to an education, one that will enable them to understand their privileges and 
responsibilities in the community. The following principles are grounded in the Philosophy: 
 
(i) 
A belief in the ability of the teaching/learning process to unlock and draw out the fullest potential of the individual; 
(ii) 
An uncompromising commitment to the pursuit of excellence by teachers, learners and all who are associated with educational enterprises; 
(iii) 
A belief in the value of the differing gifts and aptitudes of individuals, and in the importance of these differences in an inter-dependent society; 
(iv) 
An appreciation of the natural and cultural heritage of The Bahamas; 
(v) 
A recognition of The Bahamas as a part of a wider world community with which it must interact productively. 
 
 
THE CURRICULUM 
 
The curriculum developers have espoused, in part, the philosophies of John Dewey that “Knowledge is based on experience caused by the learner being in an active relationship 
with the environment” and Constructivism by Jean Piaget who proposes that “learners should be in an environment where they are engaged in questioning, hypothesizing, 
investigating, debating, analyzing and evaluating”. 
 
 
ASSUMPTIONS  
 
The Curriculum Guidelines are based on the assumptions that follow:  
 
(i) 
Students want to learn. 
(ii) 
The physical classroom environment as well as the experiences both inside and outside the classroom affect learning. 
(iii) 
Students have the capacity to construct mental interpretations and concepts of the instructional experiences. 
(iv) 
Students have the prerequisite knowledge and skills as outlined in the Appendix.  


  
General Science Curriculum 2010, Grades: 7 - 9 
vii
DESIGN 
 
The design used for the curriculum guidelines include components of several designs, namely: 
 
(i) 
Backward – initially, the knowledge, skills and attitudes required of students in order to become successful in a Science course of study in Grade 10 – 12 were identified. 
These served as the basis for the selection of learner outcomes/specific objectives, content, instructional strategies and methods of assessment in the document.  
(ii) 
Skills-based – the content is used to develop skills as learner outcomes give focus to skills.  
(iii) 
Spiral – skills and concepts are developed at each grade level (and as far as possible in successive units). 
(iv) 
Multidisciplinary – most skills are applicable in other disciplines in particular, Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, Health and Family Life, Family and 
Consumer Sciences as well as Technical Studies. Cross references are made to highlight complementary and supplementary information in other units as well as other 
subjects. 
(v) 
Flexible – it allows teachers the scope to modify the guidelines to accommodate students of high and low ability levels as well as students of different learning styles. 
(vi) 
Authentic – the examples, problems and formative assessment used are relevant to the students.   
 
 
 
OVERVIEW 
 
INTENT 
 
It is intended that the 
1. curriculum would be used by teachers throughout The Commonwealth of The Bahamas to provide a measure of standardized instruction; 
2. students having completed the three-year course of study as outlined, will have common knowledge, skills and attitudes relative to a variety of Science topics from the 
physical and biological science disciplines; 
3. students completing this course of study should exhibit a level of Scientific literacy that would enable them to function in any of the Science subjects offered at the senior 
high school level; 
4. student-focused instructional activities facilitate students in assuming responsibility for their learning; 
5. use of these guidelines will provide students with many opportunities and experiences to develop identified skills that are assessed formatively thereby preparing students 
for summative assessment of the skills in the Bahamas Junior Certificate Examinations thereby increasing their level of success in these examinations.       
 
 
 
 


  
General Science Curriculum 2010, Grades: 7 - 9

PLANNING  
 
Teachers are encouraged to use the curriculum as a guideline for planning lessons. The sequence of learner outcomes in the scope of work allows a number of closely related 
learner outcomes to be included in one lesson. An example would be an investigation in which several skills (formulating hypothesis, designing and conducting an investigation, 
using scientific equipment and materials, recognizing and controlling variables, making observations, predicting, collecting and processing data, drawing relevant conclusions) are 
included. It is important that the learner outcomes included in one lesson facilitate students in developing concepts. 
 
In an effort to place more emphasis on students’ active involvement in the teaching-learning process, there are a number of activities that require students to do research or set up 
prior to a lesson. It is therefore suggested that when Schemes of Work are developed, such activities requiring prior planning are indicated in the time sequence. Similarly, many 
opportunities are provided for group work and cooperative learning. It is important that planning include ample lead time prior to execution for such strategies.  
 
It is recognized that no curriculum guidelines would perfectly suit the pace at which all students master the information and skills. Consequently, there are several activities and/or 
similar skills outlined for a topic/sub-topic. It is suggested that teachers may omit some of the activities for classes that readily acquire the information and skills while more 
activities might be used with classes that need more reinforcement. Alternatively, if scheduling makes time a constraint, the number of activities and/or the number of learner 
outcomes addressing the same skill for a topic may be reduced. While this flexibility allows modifications to meet students’ needs, teachers are advised to ensure that this does not 
lead to insufficient time being allotted to complete the course of study or a speedy completion with excessive “revision” time.  
 
It is essential that lesson planning should be based on students’ need to develop defined skills and/or attitudes as well as knowledge.  
 
The time allocation for the completion of units of work/topics for each grade level in the curriculum is based on three lessons of 50 minutes each per week for thirty (30) weeks. 
 
 
INSTRUCTIONS 
 
Throughout the curriculum guidelines there is a dual focus to the suggested instructional strategies: that they engage students actively in the learning process and that they are 
varied to allow students of different learning styles to benefit. Teachers are therefore encouraged to use the strategies indicated, or similar ones in order to maintain these foci.  
 
To ensure ample time for the completion of the curriculum in the allotted three (3) year period, a concerted effort has been made by science curriculum committees to avoid 
duplication of information being taught at more than one school level and in more than one subject.  While teachers are encouraged to extend the curriculum and experiences on a 
lesson basis to meet the needs and interests of students, especially in the case of “high fliers”, care should be taken to avoid duplication of aspects of the senior high school 
curricula.  
 
In the same manner that there are many common features of the Bahama Islands, there are significant differences. Teachers are therefore encouraged to include examples from the 
local in planning and instructions. 


  
General Science Curriculum 2010, Grades: 7 - 9 
ix
Formative assessment is an integral part of effective planning for instruction and as such should be ongoing. Hence, a variety of means of assessing activities, skill development 
and learner outcomes are included in the curriculum. It is suggested the assessments indicated, or similar methods, are used to assess students’ progress in the identified skills, 
knowledge and attitudes. The traditional methods of assessment utilizing tests containing structured and objective/multiple choice questions similar to those used on the Bahamas 
Junior Certificate Examinations should still be used more as summative assessments at the end of units, mid-term and end of term assessment.  
 
EVALUATION  
 
As this is a draft document to be used and then evaluated, an evaluation form is included. Since the curriculum is being phased in, it is important that teachers complete and submit 
the Evaluation Form for seventh grade at the end of the first year, and eighth and ninth grades at the end of the second and third years respectively so that revisions could be made 
to each section after the year has passed to avoid a lengthy and tedious major revision of the whole curriculum at the end of three years.   
 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
RATIONALE FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE BAHAMAS 
 
To provide opportunities that engage and expose all students in The Bahamas in acquiring scientific knowledge, attitudes and skills which will enhance critical thinking, problem-
solving and organizational skills. In so doing, students will be prepared to participate in varied scientific and technological careers in the global environment, as well as realize the 
impact that they make on the natural world and appreciate the need for conservation. 
 
 
OVERARCHING GOAL  
 
To become critical thinkers, problem-solvers, innovators, visionaries, scientifically and technologically literate citizens who will appreciate, interpret and conserve the natural 
environment.

SUB-GOALS  
 
 To develop analytical and evaluative skills thus becoming critical thinkers. 
 
 To engage in scientific inquiry (including use of the scientific method) as a means of becoming problem solvers.  
 
 To utilize creativity expressions to demonstrate the application of scientific knowledge and principles. 
 
 To utilize scientific knowledge and the awareness of technological advances as a means of functioning effectively in the world. 
 
 To formulate, present and defend arguments based on facts. 
 
 To develop an appreciation for the safe and sustainable use of resources.  
 
 To obtain the basic knowledge, skills and attitudes that are necessary for success in Biology, Chemistry, Physics or Combined Science studies in senior high school.  
 
 
 
 
FOCUS 
 
It is increasingly obvious that in this age of information, no course of study can apprise students with all of the basic information of a discipline. It is therefore necessary that 
students are equipped with the skills for acquiring information and processing the information as well as making decisions based on the processed information. The scientific 
method applied to problem solving highlights the skills that prepare students for life in the community. It is therefore important that all students are provided with extensive 
opportunities to develop these skills. 
 
The combination of topics taken from a variety of scientific disciplines ensures that the students who complete this three-year course of study have a wide background in basic 
Science and technology.

RATIONALE FOR INCLUSIONS  
 
Members of the Curriculum Revision Committee reviewed junior high school science curricula from Jamaica, Guyana, Canada (Atlantic) and United Kingdom. A comparative 
analysis was done for these areas: focus, format, goals, methodologies and content.  The results of this analysis were used, in part, to inform this document. 
 
Questionnaires designed to seek the input of the public were prepared and distributed to educators, students and members of the community in North Andros, Exuma, Grand 
Bahama, Long Island, New Providence, San Salvador and Spanish Wells.  The analysis of data from the completed questionnaires was used in preparing this document.   
 
The current General Science Curriculum was revised in 1997. The 2009 revised General Science Curriculum retains the biological and physical science components along with 
mathematical infusions. The modifications to the previous curriculum are: 
 
(i) 
Deletions 
 
 The strand “Science and Me” has been eliminated. Aspects of that strand could be included in the upper primary grade levels.  
 The unit on Weather – the content for this unit is covered in the Social Studies Curriculum. Since Social Studies is a core subject, all students in junior high school will be 
exposed to the information. 
 The Solar System unit has also been eliminated as it too is adequately covered by the Social Studies Curriculum.  
 Ecosystems have been eliminated from the Ecology Unit. They have been included in the Biology Curriculum.  
 The Unit on Vertebrates has been removed and placed in the primary level curriculum.  
 
 
(ii) 
Additions  
 
 A strand on Technology has been included in the curriculum in reflecting its inclusion of technology in the curricula reviewed from other countries.  
 The life history of four economically important animals (crab, grouper, conch, lobster) and one plant (maize) have been included as a means of promoting wise conservation 
practices towards sustainable harvests of these organisms.  
 Nutrition and the Digestive System are included as a means of promoting healthy nutrition as a means of reducing the increasing number of lifestyle disorders caused by poor 
diets.  
  
(iii) 
Rearranged 
 
 The Scope and Sequence comprises skilled-based learner outcomes/activities. This matrix facilitates checking that the identified skills are included throughout Grades 7, 8 and 
9 instead of topics and sub-topics being indicated in the Scope and Sequence.  
 
 The format of the Scope of Work has been slightly modified to show the learner outcomes in the first column as a means of emphasizing their importance. A final column has 
been included with suggested methods of assessment for the learner outcomes and instructional activities. This serves to reinforce focus on the identified skills. In addition, the 
varied methods of assessment included, satisfy the overwhelming input from the Public Perception Questionnaire that assessment should not be based exclusively on tests.

deforestation on the Water Cycle.  
 
Trees absorb water through their 
roots.  The water then evaporates 
from their leaves in the process of 
transpiration. This water forms 
clouds that produce rain. 
Deforestation severely reduces 
transpiration and rainfall. Reduced 
rainfall makes available less water 
to be evaporated into the air which 
can lead to drought.

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
Formulate a hypothesis on the 
effect of a major decrease in 
rainfall on the population of crabs. 
The reproductive cycle heavily 
depends on the rainy season; 
therefore a major decrease in 
rainfall will result in a decline in 
the population. 
Formulate a hypothesis on the 
effect of a major decrease in 
rainfall on the population of crabs. 
Notes on life cycle and behavior. 
Hypothesis on the effect of a major 
decrease in rainfall on the 
population of crabs clearly stated 
with valid reasons.  
Recognize the relationship 
between rate of reproduction, 
predation rate and survival of 
crabs.  
Reproduction and the 
predictability of behavior (i.e. 
movement toward the sea to spawn 
during the rainy season could lead 
to over-harvesting and a decline in 
numbers. 
Dramatic presentation to 
demonstrate that constant rate of 
reproduction with increase in 
predation would reduce the 
number of crabs that survive.   
Notes on life cycle, reproduction 
and behavior of land crabs. 
Rubric for assessing dramatic 
presentation.   Relationship 
between rate of reproduction, 
predation rate and survival of crabs 
clearly shown.  
Make predictions on the number of 
offspring produced and the number 
that survive to maturity from one 
crab. 
Females carry their eggs (which 
can number anywhere between 
20,000 and 1,200,000) many giant 
land crabs do not survive the larval 
stage as a result of predators and 
other factors.  Therefore many 
offspring are produced in 
comparison to those who survive 
to full maturity. 
Make predictions on the number of 
offspring produced and the number 
that survive to maturity from one 
crab. 
Notes on life cycle, reproduction 
and behavior of land crabs. 
Large number given as the number 
produced, a significantly smaller 
number given as the number that 
would survive. 
Make predictions as to the crab 
population or habitats in 25 years 
should there be no restrictions on 
catch. 
No restrictions on crab catch will 
result in over-harvesting and a 
decline in the crab population. 
Make predictions as to the crab 
population or habitats in 25 years 
should there be no restrictions on 
catch. 
 
A number far less than given in 
previous assessment.  
Recognize the relationship 
between demand for crab meals 
and the rate of catching crabs. 
The demand for crab meals will 
result in an increase in the rate of 
catching crabs. 
Discuss the relationship between 
demand for crab meals and the rate 
of catching crabs.       
 
Points raised during discussion: 
increase in human population, 
increase crab “dishes”, crab fest.

Observe diagrams showing the life 
history of the Nassau Grouper.  
Eggs (1mm) hatch about 23-40 
hours after fertilization.  Juveniles 
float on currents, developing to a 
size of 1-1. 25 inches over 35-50 
days during which they are carried 
by flood tides to nursery habitats. 
Early juveniles up to 10 months 
old settle to the bottom living in 
nursery areas such as creeks and 
inshore algal beds up to a length of 
2 inches.  At about 2” they move 
to shallow patch reefs until

Explain the relationship between 
the emission of carbon dioxide and 
global warming. 
 
Carbon dioxide is produced by the 
combustion of fossil fuels. The 
build up of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere in recent decades is 
causing global warming. The 
carbon dioxide behaves like the 
glass of a greenhouse. It lets the 
Sun’s rays through to the earth’s 
surface but stops heat from 
escaping. This causes the trapping 
of heat which results in global 
warming. 
Field trip to a greenhouse or

The porosity of soil depends on the 
size of the soil particles. Soil with 
larger particles will have larger air

When water is added to a soil 
sample, the water passes through 
the air spaces. Soil with large air 
spaces will be more permeable 
than soil with small air spaces. 
Hence, more water will drain from 
soil with larger spaces than soils 
with small spaces. 
Design and conduct investigations 
to compare drainage in different 
soils. After water has finished 
dripping from each soil, record the

Soils with high drainage rates, e.g. 
sandy soils are not suitable for 
agriculture because leaching 
occurs as water passes through 
quickly carrying valuable nutrients 
with it. Clay soils retain water – 
poor drainage, easily become

Should there be no restrictions on 
catching the spiny lobster; the 
populations in 25 years will 
decrease due to overfishing 
because the grouper will be caught 
faster than it can reproduce to 
sustain the population. If laws are

Demonstrate and explain 
differences between the three 
methods of heat transmission. 
There are three methods of heat transfer: 
1. Conduction –heat moves as a result of 
particles gaining heat, vibrate, hit other 
particles and pass the heat (energy) on 
by direct contact without the particles 
changing their position. 
2. Convection – particles gain energy and 
move out of position (upward) allowing 
cooler particles to take their place. This 
sets up a convection current.  
3. Radiation – does not require a 
medium. Energy travels as waves.  Can 
travel through vacuum as particles are 
not needed. Becomes heat energy only 
when it strikes particles in solids, 
liquids or gases. The darker the surface 
the better the absorption. Shiny and 
light surfaces reflect most of their heat. 
Observe and record differences in 
rate of heat transfer in solids 
(metals), liquids (water), gases and

Observe formation of shadows. 
 
Because light travels in straight lines, 
whenever an opaque object is placed in 
the path of light a shadow is formed. A 
small light source gives one solid dark 
patch. A large light source gives two 
kinds of shadows, a dark inner patch 
called the umbra, and a lighter outer 
patch called the penumbra. 
Use opaque objects and light source 
to form shadows. Use diagrams to

Nitrogen occurs as free nitrogen gas 
in the air. Lightning converts gaseous 
nitrogen to nitrogen oxides. Nitrites 
occur in the soil. Bacteria change 
nitrites to nitrates. Nitrates are 
absorbed by plants that convert the 
nitrogen to proteins. Plant proteins 
are eaten by animals and converted to 
animal proteins. Animals release 
urine which is converted in the soil to 
ammonium compounds. Bacteria 
cause plants and animals to decay 
releasing simple nitrogen compounds 
from proteins. Nodules on 
leguminous plants have bacteria that 
convert gaseous nitrogen to nitrates.

conversions of nitrogen from one 
form to another. Nitrifying bacteria 
convert simple nitrogenous 
compounds to more complex ones. 
Denitrifying bacteria convert 
complex nitrogen compounds to 
simple ones. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
convert gaseous nitrogen directly to 
nitrates.

Correct sequence of the ovum’s 
development during the cycle. 
Describe the sequence of events 
that accompany the changes in 
the uterine lining during the 
menstrual cycle. 
Uterine lining is shed at the 
beginning of cycle, a new lining 
develops and thickens (thickest 
around ovulation),. Lining is shed at 
the beginning of new cycle.  
On a 28-day cycle show the stages 
of the development and shedding of 
the uterine lining. 
 
Description includes:  stages of 
the development and shedding of 
the uterine lining during the

Describe the change in hormone 
levels that occur during the 
menstrual cycle. 
Oestrogen level increases from 
menstruation to ovulation. Decreases 
after ovulation. Progesterone 
increases similar to oestorogen but 
some days later. Should fertilization 
occur, the level of progesterone 
remains high.

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
Recognize the relationship 
between height of ceiling and roof 
to temperature of room. 
 
Hot air rises by convection. As the 
height of the ceiling and roof 
increases, the hot air rises further 
from the floor, making rooms 
cooler.  
Design an investigation using 
model houses to determine 
whether the height of 
ceilings/roofs has an effect on the 
temperature in the rooms of 
houses. 
Textbooks – transmission of heat 
by convection in air.  
Plan includes different height 
ceiling and roofs.

Classify types of light bulbs 
according to the relative amount of 
energy used. 
 
Incandescent light bulbs use much 
energy. The larger the amount of 
power i.e. number of Watts, the 
greater the energy used. 
Fluorescent bulbs use less energy. 
Low-energy bulbs reduce the 
brightness and use less energy.  
Darken a room and observe the 
difference in brightness with 
different bulbs used in a lamp.  
40W, 60W, 100W incandescent 
bulbs, fluorescent bulb and low-
energy bulb. 
Correct classification process and 
classification of bulbs. 
Recognize the relationship 
between the brightness of lights 
and amount of energy used. 
 
The power of a light bulb, in 
Watts, is a measure of how many 
Joules of energy are converted to 
heat and light each second e.g. 
100W bulb uses 100J of energy 
every second to produce a bright 
light. 
Record the amount of energy used 
per second to produce light in each 
of the bulbs observed. Indicate 
next to each bulb a code for its 
relative brightness observed. Write 
a sentence describing the 
relationship between brightness of 
lights and the energy used.   
As above 
Clearly stated relationship between 
the brightness of lights and energy 
used.

APPENDIX I 
RUBRIC FOR ASSESSMENT 
 
What is Rubric? 
 
Rubric – a set of guidelines for assessment which states the characteristics and/or dimensions being 
assessed with clear performance criteria and a rating scale. – Policy on Assessment and Evaluation 
published by the Scarborough Board of Education, 1977.  
 
A scoring rubric consists of: 
• A fixed scale 
• A list of characteristics/criteria describing performance for each of the points on a scale. 
• Clear performance targets for students. 
 
How to design a Rubric  
• Select a result/results based on a learner outcome that will be assessed. 
• Describe a superior performance. 
• Describe a low-level performance. 
• Set different level performances between the high and low level performances described.  
• Explain the scoring criteria to students. 
• Use examples to assist students in using the rubric as a means of demonstrating their understanding.  
 
Examples of Rubric are included in this document to assist teachers in effectively using alternative 
methods of assessment. However, the use of Rubric for assessment is not limited to the categories 
shown. Teachers are encouraged to develop similar Rubric to assess learner outcomes or student 
activities that are not included. Additionally, teachers are expected to develop score sheets based on the 
criteria. An example is shown.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of the Science Instructional Programme would 
be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous. For, as Scientific Literacy increases, so does the students’ appreciation of the application of 
scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies, spawned by alert inquiring minds, to produce positive end results that can be of 
economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to incorporate current and innovative practices in the 
Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences. 
 
Increase the effectiveness of Science instruction 
 
Build students’ confidence and competence 
 
Heighten students’ expectations 
 
Promote higher overall achievement 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an effective Science Instructional Programme. These 
strategies comprise: 
 
Inquiry-based Learning  
 
Constructivism

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning; where practical “hands-
on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities and inquiring 
minds on problem solving through the application of scientific principles. 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting information 
directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to engage exploration, 
questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that this strategy (with respect 
to the teaching of Science) is very ineffective, and when compared with other modern 
approaches is now obsolete. 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method especially with regards to the 
teaching of Science results in diminished student expectation and achievement. Research 
“shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been poured unto them (via 
lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences that the teacher provides.” 
Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enables students to gain experience as a result of Science exploration. Practical experiences 
are provided and open-ended questions asked to encourage experimentation that does not 
necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to testable questions. During this 
experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks and are therefore, not afraid to make 
mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific discoveries come after many failures and 
disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for practical, 
“hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles e.g. giving them 
batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity. This strategy takes the 
learning process to a different level.  E.g. It may challenge students to use the batteries, bulb, 
wire and additional materials to develop something useful for a deaf person or something that 
can assist with a specific chore, homework assignment, etc. 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of Science is key to effective and meaningful 
instruction as it encourages students to: 
♦ Critically evaluate situations 
♦ Frame their own questions 
♦ Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment 
♦ Cultivate organizational and creative skills 
♦ Assume leadership roles and be self motivated 
♦ Be accountable for their learning 
♦ Collaborate and communicate with one another 
♦ Develop team interaction skills

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning; therefore, effective application 
of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. Constructivism means 
generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with personal knowledge that has 
been constructed from past experiences. “A Constructivist is one who believes that the 
learner is responsible for constructing knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for 
learning must be returned to the child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, 
A Model for the 21ST Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think about 
these experiences, their views and beliefs, they construct personal meaning and acquire 
knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be expected to just accept 
knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by the teacher. Instead they 
become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is encouraged and they discover and 
decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating environments 
with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to explore. The teacher’s 
main role is to provide experiences that help students make connections between what is 
learned and what they already know or believe. More learning takes place when students 
become active participants in the learning process and are “allowed to make their own sense 
out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions that they 
already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. The knowledge 
that the students construct from the information that they receive as a result of these “hands - 
on” activities makes sense and is easier for them to relate to and apply to their everyday life 
and their environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base, examine and classify their concepts then 
provide them with opportunities to share and debate common knowledge. They then convert 
and expand students’ knowledge by asking open-ended questions and presenting problems 
which cause them to gain new understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this they 
challenge and promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times when 
knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and explicit way. Although 
many benefits can be accrued from utilizing the Constructivism Theory, if it is not used 
properly, learning may become sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be 
stifled in their exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
♦ Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are expected to 
acquire; 
♦ Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are understood; 
♦ Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence; 
♦ Provide guidance for the students.

STEPPING UP TO HIGHER LEVELS OF THINKING 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of 
behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of 
learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy 
and it enables us to better understand the cognitive level 
at which students process information. Students that 
process information at the higher levels develop critical 
thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and 
evaluate. They construct new meanings, and become 
original and creative thinkers. Students that process 
information at the lower levels may not become 
independent thinkers and may not be empowered to 
problem solve. The list of 
behavioural terms are as shown. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Students can express objective and subjective opinion 
supported by fact. It is the ability to detect fallacies in 
reasoning based on facts and the ability to judge 
Apply students’ concepts learned to their environment 
and everyday life. They apply knowledge in new and/or 
practical ways to solve new problems in new situations. 
This is the lowest level of understanding. Students are expected to explain materials, 
which may be presented in a variety of forms – paragraphs, tables, charts, graphs, 
cartoons, etc. They also make inferences or solve problems when told what to do.
Students break an idea into its parts, and show that 
they understand their relationship, organization, and 
basic assumptions.

Process skills are practical skills that allow students to use previous experiences, build upon them and link knowledge and skills learned at school to their environment and every day life. 
 
Process skills help students to develop and apply critical thinking. Once given the opportunity to use and apply process skills, students develop the ability to reflect on and to evaluate their 
approaches to problem solving. As a result, students will come to the realization that there may be several solutions to any given problem. In this way, students can formulate hypotheses as 
testable ideas in their minds and can demonstrate deductive patterns of thought. Through integration of the basic and complex process skills listed, students should develop the ability to 
think logically and abstractly. 
 
Basic Process Skills 
Observing 
Using one or more of the five senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling) to find out 
about the world. Observing increases students’ perceptions so that they can learn more about 
objects and events. 
 
Classifying 
Grouping objects or events based on similarities and/or categorizing based on existing 
relationships among objects or events. 
 
Inferring 
Explaining and interpreting observed events and collected data and explaining why they might 
have happened. 
 
Communicating 
Passing on information proposing interpretations, explanations, and causes from observed 
events and collected data. 
 
Recognizing and Using Spatial Relationships 
Observing where things are in relation to other things by estimating the relative positions of 
moving and non-moving objects to one another. 
 
Measuring 
Finding out the size or amount of an object or substance when compared to a certain unit. 
Identifying and ordering length, area, volume, mass, and temperature to describe and quantify 
objects or events. 
 
Predicting 
Suggesting possible results or outcomes that will happen in the future based on observations  
and inferences drawn form previous experiences. The suggestions have to be based on correct  
information. 
Using Numbers 
Applying ordering, counting, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing to quantify data 
where appropriate in investigations or experiments. 
 
Complex Process Skills 
Interpreting Data 
Explaining the meaning or importance of information. 
 
Forming Hypotheses 
Asking questions about a problem and making assumptions in order to draw out and test 
different solutions to the problem. 
 
Separating and Controlling Variables 
Recognizing the many factors (variables) that affect the relationship of the factors to one 
another so that one factor (variable) can be manipulated while the others are controlled. 
 
Experimenting 
Test hypotheses or predictions by first identifying things (variables) that are important, then 
deciding which variables to change or manipulate which will be held constant, and what results 
to expect. 
 
Formulating Models 
Constructing mental, verbal, or physical representations or ideas, objects, or events. The 
models are then used to clarify explanations or to demonstrate relationships. 
 
Defining Operationally 
Describing the properties of things and their functions. These working definitions are based 
on actual experiences that the student had.

Students need to be taught valuable problem solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method sets out 
a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of Science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing 
the experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/ activity will turn out, that is based on prior knowledge. Although 
a good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not the hypothesis is correct or 
not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/ experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing 
the materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the 
experiment therefore; care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as 
numbered steps. (It would help if they are written with behavioural terms at the beginning.) 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data are recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, 
charts, and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data 
needs to be analyzed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The 
conclusion should state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new 
hypothesis based on findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, which 
assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by specific 
roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages group processing 
as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and employ strategies to ensure that 
they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students are 
more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is important for 
the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the quantity and quality of 
students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six weeks 
before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student should have an 
opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all members realize that they are 
jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
• 
Contributing ideas to the group 
• 
Listening carefully for ideas from others 
• 
Helping the group make good decisions 
• 
Cooperating rather than competing 
• 
Solving problems in a calm manner

Student-centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing Science, proactive in the learning process 
and willing to share and accept responsibility for their own learning. Student-centred Learning activities are adaptive and 
cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
♦ 
Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
♦ 
Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
♦ 
Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
♦ 
Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss 
and problem solve. 
♦ 
Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
♦ 
Students actively participate in decision-making. 
♦ 
Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning 
styles. 
 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
♦ 
Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
♦ 
Students must never question the teacher. 
♦ 
Students only respond when a question is asked. 
♦ 
Students must remain seated at all times. 
♦ 
Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
♦ 
Students do not participate in decision-making. 
♦ 
There is very little variation in learning activities.

HOWARD GARDNER 
 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person could be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
 
 
Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It 
may be in a person’s native language or another language. Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
 
Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It is the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations. 
 
 
Spatial Intelligence is how persons comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may 
not see. It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind--the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, 
or the way a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence 
are usually painters, sculptors, architects and scientists that deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
 
Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and 
perhaps manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music, it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical 
intelligence use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
 
Bodily - Kinesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
 
Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. Persons with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can 
manipulate numbers, operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand 
the underlying principles of some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does. 
 


  
General Science Curriculum 2010, Grades: 7 - 9 
214
 
Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which 
gives the person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things to 
avoid, and which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their 
limitations and know where to go if they need help. 
 
 
Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need; 
however, persons with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, 
intentions and motivations. Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with 
other people has to be skilled in the interpersonal sphere. 
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
 
Persons have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their 
learning and ensure higher achievement. 
 
 
Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. 
These persons often choose careers like engineer, surgeon, designer, architect and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
 
 
Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening, they process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk 
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion; 
however, they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal 
of listening. 
 
 
Kinesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They 
may become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process.

WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
♦ Whenever we interact with other people we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding, and may well make judgements about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 
♦ Assessment whether direct or indirect is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 
♦ Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance that 
describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually taught and 
what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 
♦ The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students, with a 
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 
♦ Purpose might include: 
 
⇒ Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
⇒ Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
⇒ Informing parents about progress; 
⇒ Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students e.g. when students transfer 
to a new school or new courses, which may have been studied; 
⇒ Accumulating records of achievement; 
⇒ Acting as a diagnostic tool e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken; 
⇒ Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
⇒ Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable placement 
may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make predications about likely 
future performance. 
 
Hence assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and progress of students, 
providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
⇒ Informal 
⇒ Formal 
♦ Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked 
up by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence informal assessment is often used diagnostically. 
 
♦ It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development, and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 
♦ With formative i.e. informal assessment the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback can be 
confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular time) or 
can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the learner went 
wrong. 
 
♦ Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 
♦ Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback purposes 
because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 
♦ Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and RSA 
Examinations) 
 
♦ Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at an 
early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes, tests and book reports. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment, projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the Primary Science Instructional Programme, especially portfolios and 
the keeping of Science journals.

flame. Only use these items if instructed to do so 
by the teacher. 
• When heating materials in test tubes, always slant 
the tubes away from yourself and others. 
• Wear safety aprons if you work with anything 
messy or anything that might spill. 
• Read 
all 
of 
the 
directions 
before 
doing 
experiments or using equipment. Make sure you 
understand them. If you do not, ask your teacher 
for assistance.

teacher tells you to, as soon as you finish using 
them; do not leave them where they may be 
stumbled over. 
• When using liquids or other potentially messy 
substances, cover work surfaces with newspaper. 
 
On Field Trips 
• Always be accompanied by a trusted adult – like 
your teacher or a parent or guardian. 
• Never touch animals or plants without the adult’s 
approval. The animal might bite. The plant might 
be poisonwood or another dangerous plant. 
• Stay with your group and keep within sight of the 
accompanying adult. Report any scrapes, cuts, and 
injuries to your teacher immediately. 
 
Responsibility 
• Treat living things, the environment, and each 
other with respect.
