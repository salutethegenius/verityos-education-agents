Message from the Minister 
A curriculum is considered the “heart” of any learning institution, which means that schools or universities cannot exist without a 
curriculum. With its importance in formal education, curriculum has become a dynamic process due to the changes that occur in 
our society. Therefore, in its broadest sense, curriculum refers to the “total learning experiences of individuals not only in school, 
but in society as well”  
(Bilbao et al., 2008). 
I have always believed in the transformative power of education, particularly in a developing country, and I strongly support the 
government’s commitment to sustainable development in education.  Indeed, because of the role of the curriculum in the provision of quality 
education, I am honoured to sanction and present revised national curricula in several disciplines.  Each curriculum document was 
developed by a team of intelligent, innovative and diligent education officers, who received invaluable input from teachers and lecturers; 
students and parents; as well as private and public stakeholders. 
In keeping with the changing demands of education and life in the twenty-first century, revised curricula have moved away from a content-
based, knowledge-focused approach.  The new documents focus on higher-order thinking skills; cross-curricula understanding; 
collaboration; creativity and real world problem solving.  With a view to strengthening national development activities, the new curriculum 
documents accommodate the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SGAs), ensuring that at each grade level there are clear 
processes and procedures which allow teachers to align instructional strategies and classroom-based assessments to agreed international 
standards and benchmarks.  
The publication, dissemination and successful implementation of these curriculum guidelines will further unite us in our efforts to create 
citizens of character, who are committed to life-long learning and who are always willing to serve. 
To the education officers, subject specialists and teachers, who are devoted to transforming the lives of students throughout The Bahamas, 
thank you for your continued contributions to the building of our country! 
Hon. Jerome K. Fitzgerald 
May 2017 
Minister of Education, Science and Technology

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive the education and training that will equip them 
with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in an interdependent, ever changing world. 
Modern Languages Unit: 
Vision 
We envision a Bahamas where students are linguistically, culturally and technologically equipped to communicate successfully in the target 
language, which will inspire a life-long interest in and develop an appreciation for diverse cultures, thereby creating windows of opportunity in our 
global village. 
 
Mission Statement 
To ensure student proficiency in the target language we will continue to enhance the learning environment by providing relevant curricula, producing 
indigenous materials and facilitating teacher development programs. 
Belief Statement 
We believe: 
1. 
Skills in more than one language are necessary for global communication and 21st century citizenship. 
2. 
Proficiency in a foreign language enhances self-confidence, improves one’s sense of academic achievement, heightens creativity and 
sharpens mental flexibility. 
3. 
Foreign language Instruction provides students with an improved awareness of their own language and culture. 
4. 
Language and culture are inseparable and are best taught in an integrated manner 
5. 
Foreign language programs guide students into an increased awareness and appreciation of their traditions, customs, and values as well as 
those of Hispanic and Francophone countries. 
6. 
Best teaching practices will enhance learning opportunities, increase motivation and reduce performance anxiety 
7. 
Competence in foreign languages broadens one’s advancement in the global marketplace.

Rationale 
        The reality of globalization has put The Bahamas in a position where, to survive economically, it has to be able to compete internationally. Our unique 
location places us in an enviable position at the crossroads between Europe and the Americas, including The Caribbean.  Our geographical proximity to 
these diverse countries demands that, for survival, we forge social, economic and political partnerships with bodies such as CARICOM, WTO, NAFTA, 
FTAA, and OAS.  It is incumbent upon all educators to prepare students for the multi-lingual world if they want to compete in any arena.  Effective 
communication is of paramount importance as it is at the heart of the human experience. 
        To be linguistically-challenged at this time in our development is not an option. The Bahamas has come to realize that Spanish is the predominant 
second language in our region, followed by French. It is therefore imperative that we develop language competency in Spanish and French as we develop 
our economy in tourism, international banking, trade and investment and other industries. 
        In order to keep pace with these changing times, the Modern Languages Unit in the Curriculum Section of the Department of Education has revised the 
French curricula.  
        These revised curricula will promote levels of attainments in the four language domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing, as our students 
prepare for the national examinations.  In so doing, we will be well on our way to becoming a multi-lingual nation.  The new thrust is on communicative 
objectives in authentic situations, as opposed to topics in isolation.  Teaching strategies must incorporate functional language skills.   The curricula must 
cater to the diverse needs of students and are therefore, student-centered.  These integrated curricula reinforce links with other disciplines and promote an 
appreciation for cultural diversity. 
        It is hoped that students will develop a positive attitude towards foreign language-learning, and in the process develop a greater measure of their true 
potential as life-long learners.

A GUIDE TO TEACHING FROM THE DOCUMENT 
Points to consider: 
 The document is flexible.  It is not exhaustive and should be adapted to meet students’ needs. Level 1 pertains to Grade 7 where French is usually 
introduced in government schools.  However level 1 is applicable to other grades as needed. 
 This revised document includes topics which are affiliated with the relevant communicative objectives. This makes use of the communicative objectives 
more effective. More than one communicative objective may be affiliated with the same topic(s).  Therefore no suggested sequence for the teaching of 
the communicative objectives is provided. In addition, more than one topic may be affiliated with one communicative objective. In such cases the 
suggested activities will not necessarily incorporate all of the topics.  
 Instructional strategies must be designed for the diverse needs of students. 
 Teachers must familiarize themselves with the Standards and Scope and Sequence for the attainment levels. 
 Sub-Goals 1.1 – 1.4 are not intended to be taught separately.  They should be integrated in all communicative objectives.  These Sub-Goals will not be 
presented at each level of the Scope of Work.  Where they do appear, they are examples and content may overlap with other areas of the Scope of 
Work.   
 It is possible to attain more than one Sub-Goal and its standard with one topic. 
 The combination of Sub-Goals determines the level of proficiency  
 Once the communicative objectives have been decided, teachers can refer to the Scope of Work for suggested vocabulary, structures, activities, 
assessment and resources. Teachers must beware of unnecessary repetition and adapt to meet the needs of the students. 
 Culture must be integrated. 
 Interdisciplinary links, including integrated technology, must be fostered. 
 An Assessment Weighting Guide is included in the appendices.   
 
Feeder schools should provide receiving schools with accurate information regarding students’ attainment levels.   
Incidental teaching is not reflected in the Scope of Work.  From the Scope and Sequence, teachers can determine when these teachable moments occur, 
across the levels, and needs to be addressed.
