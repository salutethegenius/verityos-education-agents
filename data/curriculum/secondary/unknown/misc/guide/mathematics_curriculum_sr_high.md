PREFACE 
 
 
This document incorporates revisions of unpublished curricula produced during numerous curriculum 
development exercises conducted by the Department of Education over the past thirty years. The objectives 
and content outlined in the Curriculum Guidelines were formulated based on national goals, current research 
and best practices in mathematics, as well as entry-level requirements for programmes at the University of The 
Bahamas and other local, regional, and international colleges and universities.   
The quest for a more coherent and relevant mathematics curriculum began after the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) officially released its Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School 
Mathematics (NCTM 1989). The Standards provided a new vision and framework for strengthening the 
mathematics curriculum. It provided the impetus for revamping the Bahamian mathematics curriculum and 
producing a document to guide the improvement of teaching and learning mathematics in both public and 
private schools. 
Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), Curriculum Focal Points for Pre-K–Grade 8 
Mathematics: A Quest for Coherence (NCTM 2006) and other NCTM publications were also considered as the 
High School Mathematics Curriculum team created the Curriculum Guidelines. In keeping with NCTM's 
vision that is based on the assumption that all students are capable of learning mathematics, the Curriculum 
Guidelines provides a framework to foster an understanding of the ‘whats’,  ‘whys’,  and ‘hows’ of 
mathematics, and ensures alignment of the content within and across all the high school grade levels, from 
grade 7 to grade 12. 
It is envisioned that teachers and parents, in home-school and homework settings, will use this document to 
guide their planning and teaching. The Scope and Sequence, Scope of Work, Strategies, and the suggested 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   4 
supplementary activities from texts and other resources, can be used to develop a high-quality learning 
experience that will help students attain the goals and objectives outlined.  
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
An extensive amount of collaboration, research, evaluating, writing and editing is credited for the creation of this document of national 
importance and magnitude. The development of the High School Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines could not have been made possible 
without the hard work, dedication, and commitment of the team of mathematics educators, Education Officers, clerical officers and 
Curriculum Supervisors. The Department of Education is grateful for the commitment, dedication, efficiency, and professionalism of the 
following persons who without them, this achievement would be unattainable.

INTRODUCTION 
 Mathematics is a vital component in the development of science, technology, industry 
and commerce, and as such, is essential in everyday life. Critical thinking, problem 
solving, and communicating ideas effectively are keys to success in a technology driven, 
information-based world. 
 The study of mathematics requires reasoning, applying, analyzing, and understanding 
of principles, ideas, and patterns in our environment. Studying mathematics equips 
students with the knowledge, skills, and mindset that are essential for meaningful 
participation in society.  
A high-quality mathematics programme provides the foundation for understanding the 
world, adapting to rapid change in the digital age, and producing twenty-first century 
global citizens. All students need classroom experiences that will help them learn 
mathematics with understanding, make connections, and apply mathematics in other 
contexts. An effective mathematics programme also develops an appreciation for the 
beauty and power of mathematics, and a sense of enjoyment and desire to learn more 
about the subject. 
 The focus of the Mathematics High School Curriculum is the content knowledge, 
understanding, and skills needed to educate students to appreciate and utilize 
mathematics. It outlines the framework that mathematics educators can use to create 
yearly schemes, design unit and lessons plans, and produce materials that will enhance the 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   6 
teaching and learning process, and ensure that their students become critical thinkers who 
can reason mathematically and solve problems. 
OVERARCHING GOALS 
  
The High School Mathematics Curriculum is designed to cultivate and develop 
students who are: 
a) proficient in logical, critical and analytical reasoning; 
b) proficient in using emerging technologies and other mathematical tools; 
c) problem solvers, communicating mathematically, and working cooperatively; 
d) able to connect classroom experiences and real life situations; 
e) self-confident and value the importance and usefulness of mathematics. 
 
 
SUB-GOALS 
The curriculum framework outlined in this document, aims to have all students in The 
Bahamas achieve the following: 
 
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge and sense of numbers, including numeration, 
patterns, ratios, and proportions. 
 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   7 
2. Estimate and understand the meaning, use, and connection between the four (4) basic 
operations; addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. 
3. Use algebraic and analytical methods to identify and describe patterns and 
relationships in data, solve problems and predict results. 
 
4. Make and use appropriate measurements of objects, quantities, and relationships and 
determine acceptable levels of accuracy. 
 
5. Demonstrate spatial sense and use geometric methods to analyze, categorize, and 
draw conclusions about plane shapes and space figures. 
 
6. Collect, organize, and analyze data using statistical methods: predict results; and 
interpret uncertainty-using concepts of probability. 
 
To achieve these overarching goals and sub-goals, all students must have many and 
varied high-quality experiences, through which they read, write, discuss, make 
conjectures, and test solutions to practical problems.

HOW TO USE THE CURRICULUM GUIDELINES 
 
Mathematics is a highly interconnected and cumulative subject. This Mathematics curriculum 
introduces skills and concepts in sequence, which contributes to and serves as building blocks for 
other concepts across grade levels. The curriculum also gives focus to important mathematics strands 
that will prepare students for continued study, and problem solving at school, home, and even work 
settings. Instead of seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected topics, students should be able to 
view, understand, and appreciate the relationships among mathematical skills and concepts. When 
students make connections and develop skills, their understanding deepens and expands. 
 
The objectives at each grade level are divided into five content strands: Number and Operations, 
Algebra, Geometry & Spatial Sense, Measurement, and Statistics & Probability.  While each of the 
five strands deals with a different area of mathematics at the respective grade levels, objectives from 
the strands should be integrated. For example, while teaching Statistics, it is natural to ask questions 
that will require students to compute data presented in graphical form. 
 
Teachers are not expected to cover the content in the order the strands are presented in the scope and 
sequence. Instead, teachers are encouraged to use this curriculum guide to formulate a yearly plan in 
a manner that integrates the content of the strands in an effort to complete the annual learning goals 
for the particular grade level.

OVERVIEW OF CONTENT STRANDS 
 
The five content strands in this document are in line with those used by the National Council 
of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). For each of the content strands, the overarching goals 
and sub-goals are outlined in the objectives of the concepts/topics. 
 
Number and Operations: This content area focuses on students’ understanding the real 
number system, types of real numbers, and graphing real numbers. Proficiency with 
operating on whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and integers is emphasized. The 
relationship between fractions, decimals and percents; rounding, approximating and 
estimating are applied to real world situations. Students are also expected to recognize, 
describe, and extend special number patterns using arithmetic operations.  
 
Algebra: Algebra provides the tools through which one communicates in the language of 
mathematics. It provides a way to explore, analyze, and represent mathematical concepts 
and ideas.  The Algebra strand develops students’ ability to recognize, represent, and solve 
problems involving relations, functions and equations. Students focus on constructing, 
evaluating and manipulating algebraic expressions, the distributive property and 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   11 
factorization, solving linear and quadratic equations, solving linear inequalities, systems of 
linear equations and inequalities.  Algebraic models are represented both symbolically and 
graphically.  Senior high students also study linear and quadratic functions, matrix algebra 
and differentiation. 
 
Geometry & Spatial Sense: Stresses the development of students' awareness of their 
physical environments through working with two- and three-dimensional shapes.  Geometry 
is a natural content area for the development of students’ reasoning and justification skills. 
They study attributes and angle properties of polygons, circles and compound shapes. 
Features prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones and spheres are used to solve real-world 
problems of compound three dimensional objects. Students identify and perform geometric 
transformations. Recognize both line and rotational symmetry. Additionally senior high 
students study trigonometry and vectors. Understanding geometric concepts is essential for 
students to make sense of measurement. 
 
Measurement: Students investigate concepts such as dimension, length, area, volume, 
capacity, time and temperature. They learn what attributes of a shape can be measured and 
how to measure by working with customary units and metric units. Students also become 
familiar with telling time using a twelve hour and twenty-four hour clock; and computing 
elapsed time.  This content strand highlights connections within mathematics and 
connections between mathematics and other subject areas, such as Social Studies, Religious 
Studies, Science, Music, Art, and Physical Education. 


High School Mathematics Curriculum – The Bahamas, 2019                                   12 
 
Statistics and Probability: Emphasizes the collection, organization, and interpretation of 
data. The primary purpose of this strand is to develop students’ ability to organize and 
analyze data intelligently, and use probabilities to describe the likelihood of events 
occurring. While junior high school students determine probabilities for simple/single 
events, senior high school students should solve problems involving compound events. 
Students display statistical data in the form of tables and graphs. Venn diagrams and tree 
diagrams are used as visual aids to solve probability problems. Statistics and Probability are 
also linked to other content areas such as sets, number and operations, geometry, and 
algebra.

An approximation is a stated value of a 
number that is close to, but not equal to, the 
exact value of the number. 
 
In approximating a number, we have to look 
at the digit value of the number that comes 
directly afterwards.  If the digit value in the 
first decimal place is 5 or more, then we add 
1 to the whole number part.  If the digit is 
less than 5, we leave the whole number part 
alone.

The addition /subtraction of like 
terms correspond to the addition 
/subtraction of their coefficients.  
 
Commutative law holds for 
multiplication of real numbers 
and algebraic terms. 
x × y = y × x 
That is, xy = yx 
 
Therefore, the order in which we 
multiply algebraic terms is not 
important. 
 
When dividing algebraic terms, 
once there is a product in the 
numerator and the denominator, 
cancellation of the common 
factors occurs. 
 
Cancelling is equivalent to 
dividing both the numerator and 
the denominator by the same 
quantity.

FACTORIZATION 
cont’d 
 
The H.C.F. of a set of algebraic terms is 
obtained by simply taking the lowest power of 
each quantity that is common to each of the 
terms and multiplying them together. 
 
The H.C.F. of 𝒙𝟐𝒚𝟓, 𝒙𝒚𝟑, and𝒙𝟒𝒚𝟐 is 𝒙𝒚𝟐. 
 
Factorize an algebraic expression be 
expressing them as the product of some of 
their factors.  When the distributive law is used 
to insert brackets in an expression, it is said to 
be factorizing. 
𝒂𝒙+ 𝒃𝒙= 𝒙(𝒂+ 𝒃) = (𝒂+ 𝒃)𝒙 
Where x and (𝒂+ 𝒃) are factors of 𝒂𝒙+ 𝒃𝒙. 
 
To factorize algebraic expressions using this 
method, you first determine the highest 
common factor (H.C.F.) of the algebraic 
expression.  You then determine the second 
factor by dividing each algebraic term by the 
H.C.F. and placing the quotient in brackets, 
due care being taken to obtain the correct 
signs.

FRACTIONS 
Add and subtract 
algebraic fractions 
with numerical 
denominators. 
 
Multiply or divide two 
algebraic expressions. 
 
Find the LCM of a set 
of algebraic 
expressions. 
When multiplying algebraic fractions, 
first multiply the numerators together, 
then multiply the denominators together 
in order to form a single algebraic 
fraction. 
 
Once there is a product in the numerator 
and the denominator, cancellation of the 
common factors occurs. 
 
Cancelling is equivalent to dividing both 
the numerator and the denominator by 
the same quantity.

EQUATIONS 
Solve simple 
linear equations 
involving 
brackets and 
variables on both 
sides. 
 
Solve fractional 
equations. 
An equation is a statement using an equals 
sign.  It is a statement of an equality 
relationship between two quantities or 
expressions. 
 
A linear equation with one unknown can 
be written in the form:𝒂𝒙+ 𝒃= 𝟎. 
 
In solving a linear equation with one 
unknown, we usually take all the unknowns 
to one side of the equation and all the 
numbers to the other side of the equation. 
 
Solving a linear equation with one 
unknown, take all the unknown to one side 
and the numbers to the other.  
E.g. Solve:5𝑥−3 = 2𝑥+ 9 
 
When the equation contains brackets, use 
the distributive law to remove brackets and 
then solve. E.g. Solve: 2(3𝑥−5) = 8 
 
To solve word problems using equations, 
you first have to form a linear equation with 
one unknown from the English statements 
given.  Then solve the constructed linear 
equation to determine the magnitude of the 
unknown quantity.

TRANSPOSITION 
Change the 
subject of a 
given formula. 
A formula is a general equation 
showing the connection between two 
or more related quantities. 
 
‘Changing the subject of the 
formula’ or ‘transposing the 
formula’ refers to the process 
whereby the formula is rearranged so 
that another given symbol becomes 
the subject. 
 
In transposing, all the rules are obeyed 
as in the solution of equations. 
Problem:  Identify

Identify open

intervals. 
Solving simple 
linear 
inequalities in 
one unknown. 
 
Illustrate the

number line. 
 
An inequation (or inequality) 
is a mathematical statement 
showing that one quantity is not 
equal to another quantity, that is, 
one quantity is greater or less 
than another quantity.  An 
inequality can be represented by 
a region on a graph. 
 
A number line is similar to the 
x-axis.  All inequalities can be 
represented on a number line. 
 
A linear inequation with one 
unknown can be written as:  
 
𝑎𝑥+ 𝑏< 0,       𝑎𝑥+ 𝑏≤0,        
𝑎𝑥+ 𝑏> 0,         𝑎𝑥+ 𝑏≥0 
 
Where a and b are constants and 
x is the unknown value. 
 
 
If an inequality is multiplied or 
divided by a negative number, 
then its sense is changed 
 
E.g.  Solve the inequation: 
        𝟑(𝟐𝒙−𝟏) > 6 
Some inequality signs 
are listed below: 
<  means “is less 
than” 
≤  means “is less than 
or equal to” 
>  means “is greater 
than” 
≥  means “is greater 
than or equal to” 
≠  means “is not equal 
to” 
 
Problem:  Explain 
what you think ≯ 
means?  Write an 
inequality using this 
symbol.

Multiply two 
matrices. 
A matrix is a rectangular 
array of numbers held 
together by curved brackets. 
Each item is called an entry 
or element. A matrix can 
have any number of rows 
and columns; rows go across 
and columns go down. 
 
The size of a matrix is 
determined by the amount of 
rows by columns. 
 
To add or subtract 
matrices they must be the 
same size. Then we add the 
entries in corresponding 
positions. 
 
To multiply a matrix by a 
scalar quantity we multiply 
every entry by the number in 
front of the brackets. 
 
Matrix E = (3

A vector quantity has both a magnitude and 
direction.  For example: weight, 
displacement, velocity, acceleration, force and 
momentum. 
 
To represent a vector quantity, simply draw a 
straight line in the same direction with a 
length directly proportional to its magnitude.  
An arrow is used to indicate the direction of 
movement of the vector.   
 
 
Vectors can be used to describe translations.   
 
Any point 𝐏(𝐱, 𝐲) can be represented by a 
column vector(x

Geometry is the branch of 
Mathematics that deals with points, 
lines, surfaces and solids.  It 
examines their properties, 
measurement and mutual relations 
in space. 
 
A point is a position.  It has no 
length, width or height.  Points can 
be used to show the position of 
towns, buildings or even pinpoints.  
Points maybe represented by dots. 
 
A line segment is part of a straight 
line between two given points. 
 
A line has no end point. It goes on 
forever in both directions. It has 
length, but no width.   Lines are 
named by writing capital letters for 
two points on the line.  
 
A ray is a straight line extending 
from a point called the origin. 
 
A plane is a flat surface that goes 
on forever in all directions.  It is a 
flat surface with no thickness. 
 
Students will make a 
list of all types of 
geometric terms and 
examples of these 
terms using real life 
examples.

The sum of the interior angles of a 
triangle is equal to 180° (or 2 right 
angles). 
 
If one side of a triangle is longer than 
another side, then the angle opposite the 
longer side is greater than the angle 
opposite the shorter side. 
 
If one angle of a triangle is greater than 
another angle, then the side opposite the 
greater angle is longer than the side 
opposite the smaller angle. 
 
If any side of a triangle is produced, (i.e. 
extended) then the exterior angle so 
formed is equal to the sum of the two 
interior opposite angles. 
 
The sum of the three exterior angles of a 
triangle is equal to 360°.

circles. 
A circle is defined as a plane curve 
formed by the set of all points which 
are a given fixed distance from a fixed 
point. 
 
The circumference of a circle is used 
to mean both the boundary line of a 
circle, and the length of the boundary 
line (i.e. the perimeter of the circle or 
the distance around the circle). 
 
A radius of a circle is a straight line 
drawn from the centre to any point on 
the circumference. 
 
A diameter of a circle is any straight 
line that joins two points on the 
circumference and passes through the 
centre. 
 
A chord of a circle is a straight line 
joining any two points on the 
circumference.

SYMMETRY cont’d 
Use properties of 
triangles, quadrilaterals 
and circles directly 
related to their 
symmetries. 
 
The line of symmetry (or the 
axis of symmetry) of a plane 
figure is a line which can be 
used as a fold, so that one half 
of the shape covers the other 
half exactly.  A plane figure can 
have one or more lines of 
symmetry. 
 
A plane figure is said to have 
rotational symmetry of a certain 
order, if the plane figure maps 
onto itself under rotations 
through stated angles about a 
common centre.

any point and its image point.  
It is a one-to-one relation off all 
points on the object onto 
corresponding points on the 
image.

Develop the 
concept of 
enlargement. 
 
Enlargement 
from the origin 
by a positive 
whole number 
scale factor. 
 
Identify the 
properties of 
each 
transformation. 
A translation is a transformation in 
which a plane figure slides along a 
straight line and changes its position 
without turning. 
Vector 𝑇= (𝑥1
𝑦1),  
𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑃′(𝑥+ 𝑥1, 𝑦+ 𝑦1) 
Results for Translations 
 The object and image are 
congruent there is no turning. 
 All points move the same distance 
and in the same direction 
 There are no fixed points 
Translations can be represented by 
vectors and added by the triangle 
law. 
 
A reflection is a way of 
transforming a shape as a plane 
mirror does. 
In the x-axis , 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑃′(𝑥, −𝑦) 
 
In the y-axis , 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑃′(−𝑥, 𝑦) 
 
In the line 𝑥= 𝑏,  𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) =
𝑃′(2𝑏−𝑥, 𝑦) 
 
In the line 𝑦= 𝑐,  𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) =
𝑃′(𝑥, 2𝑐−𝑦) 
3) It’ll help if you 
remember which 
properties remain 
unchanged in each 
transformation, too 
 
Give students a 
worksheet with three 
triangles drawn on a 
coordinate plane. Put e.g. 
object in quadrant (IV) 
and one image in 
quadrant (II) and 
quadrant (I). 
 
Have the students specify

Results of Reflections 
 Object & Image are congruent. 
 The object and image are of equal 
distance from the mirror line.  
Each image point lies on the same line 
which is perpendicular to the mirror line. 
 Each object and corresponding image 
points are equi-distance from the mirror 
line. 
 All points on the mirror line remain fixed 
by the reflection 
a)  Invariant Point  
b)   Finding the mirror line. 
 
A rotation is a transformation in which 
every point turns through the same angle 
about the same centre in the same 
direction. 
 
About the Origin 
270°  Clockwise or 90°  Anticlockwise 
𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑃′(−𝑦, 𝑥) 
 
180°  Clockwise or Anticlockwise 
𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑃′(−𝑥, −𝑦) 
 
0°  Clockwise or 270°  Anticlockwise 
𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑃′(𝑦, −𝑥) 
Have students 
determine what 
takes place when 
a translation 
occurs.   That is, 
ALL that changes 
in a translation is 
the POSITION of 
the object - 
everything else 
remains 
unchanged.

Results of Rotation 
 The object and image are congruent. 
 There is just one fixed point which is 
the centre of a rotation. 
 
An enlargement is a transformation 
which maps a shape onto a similar shape, 
from a centre of enlargement using a 
scale factor k. 
𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑃′(𝑘𝑥, 𝑘𝑦) 
 
Results of Enlargement 
 The image is similar to the object 
 Angles are unchanged 
 All lengths in the object are 
multiplied by the same factor for the 
image (i.e. the scale factor) 
 Every line in the image are parallel to 
its corresponding line in the object 
 If the scale factor (k) is 3, the area of 
the image is 32 is (9) [k2] times the 
area of the object. 
 Fractional enlargements produce 
smaller images nearer the centre. 
 Negative enlargements produce an 
image on the opposite side of the 
centre of enlargement.

Pythagoras’ Theorem 
states that in any right-
angled triangle, the 
square on the 
hypotenuse is equal to 
the sum of the squares 
on the two other sides. 
 
Problem: 
Write down the sign of: 
(a)  The tangent of every acute 
angle. 
(b) The cosine of every obtuse 
angle 
(c)  The sine of every reflex angle 
 
Problem:  A Pythagorean triple is 
a set of integers, a, b, and c, that 
could be sides of a right triangle if 
𝑎2 + 𝑏2 = 𝑐2.  The steps below 
show how to generate Pythagorean 
triples: 
1. Square an odd integer that is 
greater than 1. 
2. Find two consecutive integers 
whose sum is equal to the 
square of the number in step 1. 
The number you squared and the 
other two numbers are a 
Pythagorean triple. 
 
Choose a number and generate a 
Pythagorean triple.  Substitute it 
into the Pythagorean Theorem to 
check your results.

Define a set, elements of a set, 
finite and infinite sets, a null 
set, a universal set, a subset, 
equal and equivalent sets, 
disjoint sets. 
 
Read and write the set builder 
notations. 
 
Recognize and use set language 
and set notation, namely: 
- 
use of brackets 
- 
indicating set membership 
- 
number of elements in a set 
- 
empty set 
- 
complement of a set 
- 
universal set 
- 
subset 
- 
union and intersection 
A set is a collection of 
items, usually of the same 
kind. Each item in a set is 
called an element or 
member.   
 
∈ means “is an element of” 
and  ∉ means “is not an 
element of” 
 
In a finite set it is possible 
to count and name all the 
elements in the set. In an 
infinite set it is impossible 
to count or name all the 
elements in the set. 
 
A null set or empty set 
contains no elements.  Its 
symbol is{

and set notation, 
namely: 
- 
finite and 
infinite sets 
- 
equal and

sets 
 
Use set notation. 
The universal set is the set from which all the elements 
are taken.  The symbol is 𝛏 or ξ. 
 
A subset is a set within a set. The symbol ⊂ means “is a 
subset of”.  The symbol ⊄ means “is not a subset of”. 
 
Two sets are equal if they both have the same elements. 
Two sets are equivalent if they both have the same 
number of elements. 
 
The complement of a set is all the elements that do not 
belong to that set.  A′ means “A complement”. 
 
Union of sets is all the members of the sets.  The 
symbol is ∪.  Intersection of sets is the members that 
are common to the sets.  The symbol is ∩.

PROBLEM 
SOLVING 
Calculate the 
number of 
elements in a 
given subset of 
two intersecting 
sets. 
 
Use Venn 
diagrams to 
solve word 
problems. 
Venn diagrams can be very useful in 
finding the number of elements in certain 
subsets of two intersecting sets. 
 
𝐧(𝐁) means “number of elements in set 
B” 
For two sets: 
𝐧(𝐀∪𝐁) = 𝐧(𝐀) + 𝐧(𝐁) −𝐧(𝐀∩𝐁) 
And 
𝐧(𝐔) = 𝐧(𝐀∪𝐁) + 𝐧(𝐀∪𝐁)′ 
 
A only  – 𝐧(𝐀∩𝐁′) = 𝐧(𝐀) −𝐧(𝐀∩𝐁) 
 
B only  – 𝐧(𝐀′ ∩𝐁) = 𝐧(𝐁) −𝐧(𝐀∩𝐁)

Apply the 
multiplication law 
(also known as the 
AND law) for 
independent events 
(event which has no

events). 
 
Apply the addition law 
(also known as the OR 
law) for mutually

Draw a possibility 
space for two events 
and use it to find

Estimate the 
probability of certain 
events by experiment. 
Combined events are 
two or more events 
occurring together or 
one right after the 
other; e.g. tossing a 
coin and throwing a 
dice. 
 
If the probability P1 of 
one event is 
independent of the 
probability P2 of a 
second event, then the 
probability of both 
events is P1 x P2. 
 
The probability of the 
outcome of one event 
OR another (or both) 
occurring is obtained 
by adding the 
probabilities. 
 
Possibility space (or

A reverse percentage is where you need 
to go back in time to find the original 
amount. 
 
First, you will need to identify that the 
question is a reverse percentage question. 
Look out for questions like what did the 
item cost before the sale?  
 
Once this is done, you need to add the 
percentage to 100 if the question is a 
percentage increase question or take the 
percentage off 100 if it’s a percentage 
decrease question. Make this percentage 
equal to the amount in the question.  
 
All you need to do next is work out the 
value of 100% as this is the original 
amount. Do this by working out 1% and 
then multiplying by 100.

fraction, then the new quantity is less 
than the old quantity.  Applying this 
ratio to the old quantity is known 
as decreasing the old quantity in a 
given ratio. 
Decrease $73.35 in 
the ratio 5:9.

ESTIMATION/ 
APPROXIMATION 
Find lower and 
upper bounds of 
numbers given the 
degree of accuracy.  
(Limits of 
accuracy/Use of ± 
symbol). 
 
Calculate percentage 
error. 
When a number is rounded off, the 
lower bound is the smallest possible 
value that the number could have been, 
and the upper bound is the highest 
possible value that the number could 
have been. 
 
Percentage Error is all about 
comparing a guess or estimate to an 
exact value 
 
% Error = 
Error
Exact Value × 100 
A crowd of people 
was estimated to 
be 1000.  The 
actual number was

To factorize by grouping, 
first group algebraic terms 
in pairs, then for each pair 
of terms find the highest 
common factor.  The 
highest common factor is 
then used to factorize each 
pair of terms.  A common 
factor is then found for the 
pair of factorized terms. 
Group the common terms in 
one bracket and the highest 
common factors in another 
bracket.  The process of 
factorization is completed.

TRANSPOSITION 
Change the

formulae 
including 
powers and 
roots and the 
subject 
appearing more 
than once. 
‘Changing the subject of the formula’ or 
‘transposing the formula’ refers to the process 
whereby the formula is rearranged so that 
another given symbol becomes the subject. 
 
In transposing, all the rules are obeyed as in 
the solution of equations. 
 
When a subject appears more than once, it 
becomes necessary to factorize a set of 
terms before changing the subject of a 
formula.  To do this group the like terms on 
one side of the formula, factorize the group; 
then change the subject of the formula

Write the 
equation of a 
line through two 
given points. 
And c = the intercept of the straight line on

representing a linear function 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥+
𝑐 and a constant function 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑞 or the 
two linear equations on the same graph 
paper, using the same scales and axes.  The 
solution is then given by the point of 
intersection of the two straight lines. 
a) Use a scale of 2 cm = 1

The subtraction of vectors is 
non-commutative.   
That is, a−b≠b−c. 
 
If two vectors are both going 
in a clockwise direction or 
counter clockwise direction, 
then we can find the sum of 
the two vectors by completing 
a triangle.  The sum of the two 
vectors is called the resultant 
vector.   
 
Given vectors 𝐴𝐵
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗  and  𝐵𝐶
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ , 
we complete the triangle 
ABC. 
 
𝑨𝑪
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗  = 𝑨𝑩
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ + 𝑩𝑪
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗  where 𝐴𝐶
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ is 
the resultant vector of 𝐴𝐵
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗  and 
𝐵𝐶
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ .  Note that  𝑨𝑩
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ + 𝑩𝑪
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ =
𝑩𝑪
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ + 𝑨𝑩
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗  
 
The magnitude of a vector is 
found using Pythagoras’ 
Theorem.  That is, if AB
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ =
(x
y) then 
 /AB
⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ /= √x2 + y2.

To calculate the area of a non-
right triangle given the length of 
two sides and the included angle. 
A = ½ ab sin C  
Area = ½ fg sin E 
21.3 = ½ x 8 x 6 x sin E 
21.3 x 2 = sin E 
   8 x 6 
0.888 = sin E (Remember that 
there two possible solutions.) 
Angle E = 62.6o or 
Angle E = (180o – 62.6o)    
= 117.4 o 
Since the largest angle is required  
Angle E = 117.4 o

Reduce a given 
algebraic 
fraction to its 
lowest form. 
 
Solve quadratic 
equations 
containing 
algebraic 
fractions. 
In some cases, factorization is necessary 
to simplify algebraic fractions. 
 
In order to multiply and divide algebraic 
fraction, it is necessary to: 
a) First, factorize the numerator or 
denominator, or both the numerator 
and denominator. 
 
b) Cancel the common factors. 
 
All quantities in a pair of brackets are 
regarded as a single term.  Therefore, 
cancelling a term in the numerator with a 
term in the denominator is equivalent to 
dividing both the numerator and 
denominator by the same term.   
 
It is also very important to understand 
that we can cancel terms only if there is 
a product in the numerator and in the 
denominator.   
E.g. Simplify
𝒙𝟐−𝟖𝒙𝒚+𝟏𝟔𝒚𝟐
𝟑𝒙𝟐−𝟏𝟐𝒙𝒚 
 
In order to add or subtract algebraic 
fractions, it is necessary to:

b) Find the lowest common multiples of the 
denominators. 
 
c) Express the fractions as equivalent fractions over 
the common denominator, using brackets  
d) Add or subtract the like  terms in the numerator as 
necessary. 
 
e) Factorize the numerator and denominator in order 
to reduce the fraction to lowest terms where 
possible. 
 
The L.C.M. of a set of algebraic terms is the smallest 
expression that is a multiple of each of the given terms.  
It is obtained by taking the highest power of each factor 
and multiplying them all together.

plane. 
When two or more linear 
inequations are drawn 
simultaneously on graph, using 
the same scales and axes, then 
their common solution lies in the 
area where the region 
representing the inequations 
intersect (that is, overlap) at the 
same time. 
 
This area called the common 
region, is usually in the shape of 
a polygon.

When a tangent is drawn at the 
turning points of a curve, the 
tangent is parallel to the 𝑥−𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑠 
and hence at both points  
𝒅𝒚
𝒅𝒙= 𝟎.  
This gives the turning points.   
 
To determine which of the values of 
x makes y a maximum and which 
makes y a minimum.  Take a value 
of x just slightly less than the value 
of x at the turning point and 
substitute this value in the 
expression for 
𝒅𝒚
𝒅𝒙 to discover which 
turning point is a maximum and 
which is a minimum.  If the number 
is positive, it is the maximum point.  
If the value obtained is negative, the 
value substituted is the minimum.  
Substitute the x values in f(x) to find 
y values.   
 
The equation of a line: 𝑦= 𝑚𝑥+ 𝑐. 
 
To find the equation of the tangent, 
substitute the values of the gradient 
(m) and the values of x and y from a 
given point into the equation on the 
line.  Solve to find c.

Calculate 
conditional 
probability 
 
Mutually exclusive events 
cannot occur at the same time. 
E.g. tossing a coin once, this 
can result in either head or tail, 
but not both. 
 
Dependent events are events 
where the outcome of one event 
affects the outcome of another. 
E.g., if you draw two colored 
balls from a bag and the first 
ball is not replaced before you 
draw the second ball then the 
outcome of the second draw 
will be affected by the outcome 
of the first draw. 
 
Independent events are two 
events, A and B, where the fact 
that A occurs does not affect the 
probability of B occurring. E.g. 
choosing a marble from a jar 
AND landing on heads after 
tossing a coin.  
 
Conditional probability is the 
probability that an event will 
occur, given that one or more 
other events have occurred.

X-intercept(s): The x coordinate(s) of the point(s) of intersection of a graph and the x-axis. 
Y-axis: The vertical axis of a rectangular coordinate plane. 
Y-coordinate: The second number in an ordered pair indicating the vertical distance of a point from the origin in the coordinate plane. 
Y-intercept: The point of intersection of a graph with the y-axis. 
Zero-Dimensional (0D): No measurable extent or attribute. A point is zero dimensional because it only specifies a location.  
Zero power: For any nonzero number x, x0 = 1. 
Zeros of a Quadratic Function: See Roots of a Quadratic Equation.
