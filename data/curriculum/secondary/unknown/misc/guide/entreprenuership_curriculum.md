PREFACE 
 
Entrepreneurship plays a very important role in our society today.  The subject therefore 
serves to address a primary need to ensure that students in Business programmes are 
exposed to current trends and practices that have significant implications for the 
Entrepreneurship and general commercial and economic environment in the country. 
Entrepreneurship addresses the commercial potential for developing, organizing, and 
managing business ventures.  While acknowledging the risks and expenses involved, 
entrepreneurs seek innovative ways of making a profit by translating inventions or 
technologies into needed products and services.  This course of study will expose students 
to important entrepreneurship principles, which should adequately prepare them to become 
successful entrepreneurs in the near future. 
 
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
In our efforts to prepare globally competitive and productive entrepreneurs within our 
society, such preparation must be guided by consistent, relevant, and critically challenging 
content.  It was with this mandate in mind that the subject was originally introduced to our 
Junior High students and teachers by Mrs. Anita Wilmott and Mrs. Syan Rahming, who also 
created workbooks for varied grade levels for Entrepreneurship.  After assuming 
responsibility as Education Officer for Junior High Business Studies, Ms. Aldeka Colebrooke 
too shared the passion for training and educating future entrepreneurs at the earliest age 
possible. She quickly formed a team of teachers also dedicated to officially making this vision 
a reality. Due to the diligence and collaborative efforts of E.O. Aldeka Colebrooke, Mrs. Anita 
Wilmott, Mrs. Syan Rahming, Ms. Kendia Barr, Mrs. Shantell Miller, and Mrs. Desiree 
Edgecombe-Wilson, this curriculum came to fruition.
