MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
 
MISSION STATEMENT 
 
The mission of the Department of Education is to provide all persons in The Bahamas an opportunity to receive an education that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, 
attitudes, knowledge and skills required for work and life in a democratic, Christian society. 
 
 
THE PHILOSOPHY 
 
The Department of Education embraces a philosophy that all human beings have an undeniable right to an education, one that will enable them to understand their privileges and 
responsibilities in the community. The following principles are grounded in the Philosophy: 
 
(i) 
A belief in the ability of the teaching/learning process to unlock and draw out the fullest potential of the individual; 
(ii) 
An uncompromising commitment to the pursuit of excellence by teachers, learners and all who are associated with educational enterprises; 
(iii) 
A belief in the value of the differing gifts and aptitudes of individuals, and in the importance of these differences in an inter-dependent society; 
(iv) 
An appreciation of the natural and cultural heritage of The Bahamas; 
(v) 
A recognition of The Bahamas as a part of a wider world community with which it must interact productively. 
 
 
THE CURRICULUM 
 
The curriculum developers have adopted, in part, the philosophies of John Dewey that “Knowledge is based on experience caused by the learner being in an active relationship 
with the environment” and Constructivism by Jean Piaget who proposes that “the learner should be in an environment where they are engaged in questioning, hypothesizing, 
investigating, debating, analyzing and evaluating.” 
 
 
ASSUMPTIONS  
 
The Curriculum Guidelines are based on the assumptions that follow:  
 
(i) 
Students want to learn. 
(ii) 
The physical classroom environment as well as experiences both inside and outside the classroom affect learning. 
(iii) 
Students have the capacity to construct mental interpretations and concepts of the instructional experiences. 
(iv) 
Students have the prerequisite knowledge and skills as outlined in the Appendix IV.

DESIGN 
 
The design used for the curriculum guidelines include components of several designs, namely: 
 
(i) 
Backward – initially, the knowledge, skills and attitudes required of students exiting secondary school after completing a three-year Biology Course of study were 
identified. These served as the basis for the selection of learner outcomes/specific objectives, content, instructional strategies and methods of assessment in the document.  
(ii) 
Skills-based – the content is used to develop skills. Consequently, learner outcomes give focus to skills.  
(iii) 
Spiral – skills and concepts are developed at each grade level (and as far as possible in successive units). 
(iv) 
Multidisciplinary – most skills are applicable in other disciplines in particular, Language Arts, Mathematics, Geography, Family Life as well as Family and Consumer 
Sciences. Cross references are made to highlight complementary and supplementary information in other subjects (as well as units). 
(v) 
Flexible – it allows teachers the latitude to modify the guidelines to accommodate students of high and low ability levels as well as students of different learning styles. 
(vi) 
Authentic – the examples, problems and formative assessment used are relevant to the students’ common experiences.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
OVERVIEW 
INTENT  
 
It is intended that the 
 
1. curriculum would be used by teachers throughout The Commonwealth of The Bahamas to provide a measure of standardized instruction; 
2. students having completed the three-year course of study as outlined, will have common knowledge, skills and attitudes relative to a variety of Science topics from the 
biological science disciplines; 
3. students completing this course of study should exhibit a level of Scientific literacy that would enable them to function in first-year tertiary level Biology Courses;  
4. student-focused instructional activities facilitate students in assuming responsibility for their learning; 
5. the use of these guidelines will provide students with many opportunities and experiences to develop identified skills that are assessed formatively thereby preparing 
students for summative assessment of the skills in the Bahamas General Certificate of Secondary Education Examinations, thereby increasing their level of success in these 
examinations.

PLANNING  
 
Teachers are encouraged to use the curriculum as a guideline for planning lessons. The sequence of learner outcomes in the scope of work allows a number of closely related 
learner outcomes to be included in one lesson. An example would be an investigation in which several skills (formulating hypothesis, designing and conducting an investigation, 
using scientific equipment and materials, recognizing and controlling variables, making observations, predicting, collecting and processing data, drawing relevant conclusions) are 
included. It is important that the learner outcomes included in one lesson facilitate students in developing concepts. 
 
In an effort to place more emphasis on students’ active involvement in the teaching-learning process, there are a number of activities that require students to do research or set up 
investigations, prior to a lesson. It is therefore suggested that when Schemes of Work are developed, such activities requiring prior planning are indicated in an appropriate 
timeline. Similarly, many opportunities are provided for group work and cooperative learning. It is important that planning includes ample lead time prior to presentations being 
made.  
 
It is recognized that no curriculum guidelines would perfectly suit the pace at which all students master the information and skills. Consequently, there are several activities and/or 
similar skills outlined for a topic/sub-topic. It is suggested that teachers may omit some of the activities for classes that readily acquire the information and skills while more 
activities might be used with classes that need more reinforcement. Alternatively, if scheduling makes time a constraint, the number of activities and/or the number of learner 
outcomes addressing the same skill for a topic may be reduced. While this flexibility allows modifications to meet students’ needs, teachers are advised to ensure that this does not 
lead to insufficient time being allotted to complete the course of study or a speedy completion with excessive “revision” time.  
 
It is essential that lesson planning should be based on students’ need to develop defined skills and/or attitudes as well as knowledge.  
 
The time allocation in the curriculum is based on two 70-minute lessons per week or three lessons of 50 minutes each per week for thirty (30) weeks per year. 
 
 
INSTRUCTIONS 
 
Throughout the curriculum guidelines there is a dual focus to the suggested instructional strategies: that they engage students actively in the learning process and that they are 
varied to allow students of different learning styles to benefit. Teachers are therefore encouraged to use the strategies indicated, or similar ones.  
 
A concerted effort has been made by science curriculum committees to avoid duplication of information being taught at more than one school level and in more than one subject. 
While teachers are encouraged to ensure that students derive the maximum benefits from each lesson, care should be taken to avoid automatically re-teaching information and 
concepts that have been designated to junior high school curricula.  
 
In the same manner that there are many common features of the Bahama Islands there are significant differences geographically and in terms of availability of resources. Teachers 
are therefore encouraged to include local examples in their planning and instructions.

vii 
 
Formative assessment is an integral part of effective planning for instruction and as such should be ongoing. Hence, a variety of means of assessing activities, skill development 
and learner outcomes are included in the curriculum. It is suggested that these, or similar methods, are used to assess students’ progress in the identified skills, knowledge and 
attitudes.  The traditional methods of assessment utilizing tests containing structured questions and objective/multiple choice questions similar to those used on the Bahamas 
General Certificate of Secondary Education Examinations should be used more as summative assessments for the end of unit, mid-term and end of term assessment.  
 
EVALUATION  
 
As this is a draft document to be used and then evaluated, an evaluation form is included. Since the curriculum is being phased in, it is important that teachers complete and submit 
the Evaluation Form for tenth grade at the end of the first year. Similarly, forms for eleventh and twelfth grades should be remitted at the end of the second and third years 
respectively.  This would enable revisions to be made to each section after the year has passed; thereby avoiding a lengthy and tedious major revision of the whole curriculum at 
the end of three years.   
 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
RATIONALE FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE BAHAMAS 
 
To provide opportunities that engage and expose all students in The Bahamas to the methodology of acquiring scientific knowledge, attitudes and skills which will enhance critical 
thinking, problem-solving and organizational skills. In so doing, students will be prepared to work in varied scientific and technological careers in the global environment, as well 
as realize the impact that they make on the natural world and appreciate the need for conservation. 
 
 
OVERARCHING GOAL  
 
To become critical thinkers, problem-solvers, innovators, visionaries, scientifically and technologically literate citizens who will appreciate, interpret and conserve the natural 
environment.

SUB-GOALS  
 
 To develop analytical and evaluative skills thus becoming critical thinkers. 
 
 To engage in scientific inquiry (including use of the scientific method) as a means of becoming problem solvers.  
 
 To utilize creativity expressions to demonstrate the application of scientific knowledge and principles. 
 
 To utilize scientific knowledge and the awareness of technological advances as a means of functioning effectively in the world. 
 
 To formulate, present and defend arguments based on facts. 
 
 To develop an appreciation for the safe and sustainable use of resources.  
 
 To obtain the basic knowledge, skills and attitudes that are necessary for success in Biological Courses of study at the tertiary level. 
 
 To develop skills that are necessary for success in entry level Biology-related jobs/careers.  
 
 
 
 
FOCUS 
 
It is increasingly obvious that in this age of information, no single course of study can provide students with all of the basic information of that discipline. It is therefore necessary, 
that students are equipped with the skills for acquiring information and processing the information as well as making decisions based on the processed information. The scientific 
method applied to problem solving highlights the skills that prepare students for life in the community. It is therefore important that all students are provided with extensive 
opportunities to develop these skills. 
 
The combination of topics ensures that students who complete the three year course of study, have a wide background in plant and animal physiology, cell biology and ecology.

RATIONALE FOR INCLUSIONS  
 
Members of the Curriculum Revision Committee reviewed Biology curricula from Canada, United Kingdom and United States of America. A comparative analysis was done for 
these areas: focus, format, goals, methodologies and content.  The results of this analysis were used, in part, to inform this document. 
 
Questionnaires designed to seek the input of the public were prepared and distributed to educators, students and other members of the community in Abaco, Mangrove Cay – 
Andros, Berry Islands, Bimini, Cat Island, Crooked Island, Harbour Island, New Providence and San Salvador. The analysis of data from the completed questionnaires was used in 
preparing this document.   
 
As there is no existing Biology Curriculum, the BGCSE Biology Syllabus 1996 is used for comparison in three areas:  
 
(i) 
Deletions 
 
• Characteristics of living organisms are covered in the Primary Science Curriculum. 
• Classification of organisms is a part of the General Science Curriculum. 
• The Water, Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles are included in the General Science Curriculum.  
• Food chains and webs are included as topics in the General Science Curriculum but are integrated in the ecosystems units in this document. 
• The Conch and Maize have been moved to the General Science Curriculum.   
• Contraceptives have been designated to Junior High School curricula as well as Health and Family Life Curriculum. 
 
(ii) 
Additions  
 
 A brief section on plant excretion has been included for completion in comparative physiology. 
 Bio-Technology has been included in the curriculum in keeping with content in curricula studied from other countries.  
 Food safety, food additives, role of microbes in food have been included to reflect the need for emphasis to be placed on the relationship between diets and healthy lifestyles. 
 
(iii) 
Modifications 
 
 Parts of a flowering plant, external differences between monocotyledons and dicotyledons are covered in the Primary Science Curriculum. The internal structure of 
monocotyledonous roots, stems, leaves; dicotyledonous roots, stem, leaves are included in Plant Anatomy.  
 Ecology has been expanded to include a woodland (pine forests, coppice, drought resistant), biodiversity, national parks and protected areas, and fisheries management. 
 Cell diversity and organization have been relegated to Junior High School Curricula. Cell Biology has been expanded to include use of macromolecules in the structure and 
functions of cells, details of meiosis, function of important ions in the cell, Nucleic acids (DNA & RNA) a basic description of structure and function, and genetic engineering. 
 
 
 


Biology Curriculum 2010, Grades: 10 – 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
xi 
 Food nutrients and the digestive system have been designated to the Junior High School Curricula while human dentition has been designated to the Primary Science 
Curriculum. However, the specialization of dentition and alimentary canals of carnivores and herbivores are included in this document. Simple chemical composition of food 
nutrients is included. 
 Fishing is included with a focus on technology as a means of maintaining sustainable catch, instead of fishing gear which is included in Social Studies.  
 Agriculture is also included with a focus on the use of technology to maintain yields needed to feed an increasing population instead of focusing on the effects on the 
environment of bad agricultural practices.  
 The Human Physiology has been expanded in several topics. Respiration includes the formation and dissociation of ATP as well as the control of breathing. Blood groups have 
been added to the Circulatory System. The Lymphatic System has been included. The structure of the Human Reproductive System is included in the Junior High School 
Curricula. However, the development and release of human gametes, structure of gametes, and use of technology in fertilization have been added to the Reproduction Section. 
Human Growth and Development has defined guidelines. Sexually Transmitted Infections are included in this document. However, with the exception of AIDS the diseases are 
different from those included in the Junior High School Curricula. The knee joint and muscles have been added as additional effector organs.  
 
 (iv)  Format 
 
 The format of the Scope and Sequence allows referencing to the extent to which skills are targeted at each grade level. It also indicates the depth of content to be covered and 
the order of sub-topics.   
 The Scope of Work includes learner outcomes, content, student activities, resources and assessment strategies. The learner outcomes have been placed in the first column as a 
means of emphasizing their importance. A final column has been included with suggested methods of assessment for the learner outcomes and instructional activities. This 
serves to reinforce focus on the identified skills. In addition, the varied methods of assessment included, represent an attempt to satisfy the overwhelming input from the Public 
Perception Questionnaire that assessment should not be based exclusively on tests.

1Mangroves are flowering plants 
(angiosperms) adapted to the interface 
between land and sea, lakes/ponds, areas 
that are sheltered from high wave action, 
endure a highly dynamic, low oxygen 
environment,  cope with high salinity; 
grow most extensively in muddy 
sediments. Often distinctly zoned, but 
may include large stands of only one or 
two species.

Explain the role of 
zooxanthellae.  
 
Zooxanthellae are algae living inside 
coral for protection and access to light.  
Coral polyps make use of carbohydrates 
and oxygen the algae make as a result of 
photosynthesis.  Zooxanthellae also help 
with the corals ability to make their 
limestone skeleton. Pigments in algae 
give coral its colour.  
• Compare photographs of 
bleached coral and healthy 
coral.

Use materials and apparatus to

Yeast respires anaerobically, changing 
glucose (C6H12O6) to ethanol 
(C2H5OH) and carbon dioxide (CO2).  
The test for carbon dioxide is that it 
turns clear lime water cloudy or milky 
white. Anaerobic respiration in yeast 
is also called alcoholic fermentation. 
The carbon dioxide produced when 
yeast respires is used to make dough 
and batter (for bread, cakes…) rise in 
baking and to give alcoholic beverages 
their sparkle or ‘fizz’ in brewing.

Differentiate between aerobic and 
anaerobic respiration. 
 
Aerobic means that respiration takes 
place in the presence of oxygen. The 
food molecules are combined with and 
oxidized by oxygen. The glucose is 
converted to CO2 and H2O and lots of 
free energy is released. Anaerobic 
means that respiration takes place in 
the absence of oxygen. The glucose is 
not completely oxidized to CO2 and 
H2O, but is converted to CO2 and 
C2H5OH (alcohol) or to C3H6O3 (lactic 
acid). Only little energy is released. 
Indicate the differences between 
aerobic and anaerobic respiration

Make a model showing the

The mitochondrion is a tiny rod-like, 
spherical, or elongated organelle 
where aerobic respiration occurs. It is 
referred to as the ‘powerhouse’ of the 
cell because it generates all of the 
cell’s energy. The inner membrane of 
the mitochondria is greatly folded 
(cristae), increasing its surface area. 
Many chemical reactions take place on 
this inner membrane. The fluid area 
inside the mitochondria is called the 
matrix. It is filled with water and 
proteins (enzymes). The proteins 
combine food molecules with oxygen 
and the material is digested. This 
keeps the cell full of energy. 
• Observe the internal feature of 
a mitochondrion and explain 
how it is adapted for 
respiration.

cristae on the internal surface.

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
Infer why it is better to breathe 
through the nose than through the 
mouth. 
The trachea and larger air passages are 
lined with mucus secreting cells. The 
mucus traps dirt and bacteria in 
inhaled air. Tiny hair-like structures 
called cilia cover some cells and beat 
back and forth very quickly, sweeping 
the mucus and trapped particles back 
towards the mouth, preventing them 
from entering the lungs. A network of 
capillaries underlies the ciliated  
mucus membrane and blood in the 
capillaries warm the incoming air. 
Hence, air entering the nose is 
warmed, moistened, and filtered. 
These protective functions are not 
performed when air is breathed in 
through the mouth, increasing the risk 
of infection. 
• Examine the features of the 
nose and mouth as portals for 
breathing. 
• Compare the efficiency of the 
nose and mouth as entrances 
for breathing. 
• Make an annotated diagram of 
the nose/nasal passages and

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
Construct a model of the human 
respiratory system to demonstrate 
breathing. 
Breathing involves inhaling and 
exhaling. When we inhale, the 
diaphragm and intercostal muscles 
contract, pushing the ribs up and out. 
This increases the volume in the 
thorax, but decreases the pressure. Air 
rushes in through the nose and mouth, 
forcing the lungs to expand or inflate. 
When we exhale, the diaphragm and 
intercostals muscles relax, pulling the 
ribs down and in. This decreases the 
space in the thorax and increases the 
pressure.  Air rushes out of the lungs, 
causing them to deflate. 
• Construct a working model of 
the respiratory system  
• Utilize the model of the 
respiratory system to orally

Compare relative amounts of 
carbon dioxide in inhaled and 
exhaled air.  
As air is breathed in and crosses the 
respiratory membranes, it is 
moistened. The oxygen in the air is 
used for respiration and carbon 
dioxide is released. Nitrogen cannot 
be used in its gaseous state by human 
beings hence, the percentage is the 
same in exhaled and inhaled air. 
Exhaled/expired air has a lower 
oxygen but a higher carbon dioxide 
and water vapour content than 
inhaled/inspired air

Describe the passage of an oxygen 
molecule from the air to a 
capillary in the lungs. 
When air is inhaled, it passes along 
the nasal passages, down the trachea 
and into the bronchial tubes until it 
reaches the lungs. Oxygen molecules 
then diffuse from the air into the blood 
in the capillaries.

Construct a bar graph comparing 
average breathing rates before and

When the muscles work harder, they 
require more oxygen and the extra 
carbon dioxide produced must be 
removed as quickly as possible before 
it builds up and poisons the tissues. To 
accomplish this, we must breathe 
deeper and faster. Faster breathing rate 
supplies the increased oxygen 
demand.

There are millions of alveoli in each 
lung, producing a large surface area 
for gas exchange.  Each alveolus is 
surrounded by a network of capillaries 
in which oxygen and carbon dioxide 
are transported. The membrane 
separating the alveolus and capillaries 
is extremely thin so the gases only 
have a short distance to diffuse across.  
A thin layer of fluid in which the 
oxygen dissolves covers each 
alveolus.

Predict the direction in which 
oxygen and carbon dioxide 
molecules move across gas 
exchange surfaces based on the 
principles of diffusion. 
 
Diffusion is the movement of 
molecules from an area of high 
concentration to an area of low 
concentration until they are evenly 
spread. Since the air in the alveolus 
has a higher concentration of oxygen 
than blood entering the capillary, 
oxygen diffuses from the air into the 
blood. There is more carbon dioxide in 
the blood in the capillary than in the 
air in the alveolus. Therefore, carbon 
dioxide diffuses from the blood into 
the air. 
• Create a concept map showing 
the directions in which 
oxygen and carbon dioxide 
molecules will diffuse across 
a gas exchange surface.

Cigarette smoke contains carcinogens

persons who smoke are more likely to 
get lung cancer than non-smokers. 
Smoking also causes destruction of 
cilia so the air is not filtered and this 
causes bronchial infections or 
bronchitis. The production of excess 
mucus leads to the characteristic 
“smoker’s cough”.

Apply the principles of 
monohybrid inheritance to the 
inheritance of A, B Blood 
Grouping.  
 
The human X-chromosome carries 
some alleles for which there are no 
partners on the Y-chromosome (which 
doesn't carry any alleles except those 
that decide gender). The result of 
inheriting an allele like this is different 
for males and females, and so the 
characters they code for are called 
sex-linked characters. A sex-linked 
allele inherited by a male is expressed 
even if it is recessive because it is not 
hidden by another, dominant, allele. 
So almost all who suffer from this 
disease are males.

Design, conduct and evaluate an 
experiment to prove that 
transpiration mainly occurs 
through the leaves of a plant. 
 
Transpiration is the loss of water 
vapour through the shoot (mainly 
leaves) of plants. The rate of 
transpiration can be affected by 
various environmental factors such as 
humidity, wind, and temperature. 
Increase in the wind speed and 
temperature, increases the rate of 
transpiration in plants. An increase in 
the humidity will decrease the rate of 
transpiration in plants.

stem region of a tree trunk. 
 
If a ring of bark is cut from around a 
tree trunk, food substances cannot get 
down the trunk. A bulge will result 
above the ring due to the accumulation 
of food. In a tree trunk, the phloem is 
located in the soft inner part of the 
bark that was removed.  This phloem 
transports food substances.

Use a stethoscope to investigate 
heartbeat 
Complete contraction and relaxation of 
heart produces two-tone (lub-dub) 
sound.  The first tone heard is due to the 
closing of the tricuspid and bicuspid 
valves as the ventricles contract. 
The closing of the semi-lunar valves is 
the second sound followed by a pause. 
On average the heartbeat is 72 beats per 
minute.  Heartbeat increases with 
exercise as contraction of muscles need 
more of oxygen and nutrients carried by 
blood.  Adrenalin increases the heart 
rate.  Differences in sound allow doctor 
to diagnose disorders

Blood pressure is measured in large 
arteries and expressed by 2 numbers. 
The first number is a measure of   
the pressure caused when the 
ventricles contract and blood is 
pushed out the heart – systolic 
pressure. Then blood pressure drops 
as the ventricles relax. The second 
number is a measure of the diastolic 
pressure that occurs as the ventricles 
becomes filled with blood before 
they contract again such as systolic 
120, diastolic 80. Techniques in 
using Sphygmomanometer 
Students take turns measuring 
arterial blood pressure on a partner

Research cardiovascular 
diseases. 
A heart attack is caused by the build-up of 
fatty substances, cholesterol, calcium and 
other substances that make up plaque. 
Plaque can begin to build up within the 
inner linings of the larger arteries of the 
body in childhood, but it takes much longer, 
usually thirty years or more, for the build-up 
to escalate to dangerous levels. This process 
of plaque build-up is called atherosclerosis, 
a process which is quickened by having 
high blood pressure or cholesterol, diabetes 
or especially by smoking Because less 
blood is getting through to the heart, 
oxygen, which is carried within the blood 
cells, also becomes limited. If one or more 
artery (arteries) becomes completely 
blocked, a heart attack follows.  
If immediate treatment, usually surgery to 
clear up the arteries, is not administered, the 
muscles of the heart become permanently 
injured, causing the patient to die or become 
disabled.  
A heart attack can, less frequently than by 
the complete blocking of the arteries, also 
be caused by a severe spasm or tightening 
of the coronary artery, which temporarily 
cuts off blood flow from the heart

( alters salt concentration in the 
medulla to aid in reabsorption of 
water from the collecting duct) then 
ascends back into the cortex. The 
tubule twists and turns again this is

When it is very hot, there is an

chronic diarrhea or vomiting, or eat 
salty foods, the body loses lots of 
water and salts. As a result, your 
blood becomes too concentrated. 
The pituitary secretes ADH which 
causes lots of water to be 
reabsorbed and the bladder 
produces a small volume of 
concentrated urine. When it is cold, 
you perspire little, or drink lots of 
water, the blood becomes dilute. 
The pituitary secretes less ADH. 
Little water is reabsorbed and the

When the pancreas fails to produce 
sufficient insulin or does not use the 
insulin produced efficiently or 
properly, a condition known as 
diabetes mellitus develops. In 
persons suffering from diabetes 
mellitus, the amount of glucose in 
the blood rises so high that the 
kidneys begin to excrete glucose 
into the urine. The presence of this 
glucose can be tested for by using 
Benedict’s reagent. A yellow, 
green, or brick-red, orange color 
indicates a positive result.

Explain how the kidneys and 
hypothalamus control the water 
content of the blood. 
If the blood passing through the 
brain is too concentrated, the 
hypothalamus stimulates the 
pituitary gland to secrete anti- 
diuretic hormone (ADH) into the 
blood. When the pituitary secretes a 
large amount of ADH, the tubules 
reabsorb more water from the 
glomerular filtrate, giving a small 
volume of concentrated urine. If the 
blood passing through the blood is 
too dilute, the pituitary suppresses 
the secretion of ADH. When the 
production of ADH is suppressed, 
the tubules become less permeable 
and less water is reabsorbed from 
the glomerular filtrate, resulting in a 
large volume of dilute urine.

Create a flow diagram to explain 
how the liver and pancreas 
control the sugar content of the 
blood. 
When the glucose concentration in 
the blood is too high, the pancreas 
secretes the hormone insulin. This 
causes the liver to convert glucose 
into glycogen, lowering blood 
glucose. When the glucose 
concentration in the blood is too 
low, the pancreas secretes the 
hormone glucagon. This causes the 
liver to convert glycogen back into 
glucose, raising blood glucose. 
Draw a flow chart or concept map

Create a flow diagram to explain 
the role of the skin in controlling 
body temperature. 
When it is too cold, erector muscles 
contract, pulling the hairs up to trap an 
insulating layer of air. This causes the 
characteristic “goose-pimples”. 
Arterioles just below the surface of the 
skin constrict and constrict so that less 
blood containing heat flows near the 
surface of the skin (Vasoconstriction).  
Sweat glands become less active, 
decreasing the production of sweat. 
The muscles contract more 
(shivering), producing heat which 
helps to raise the body temperature. 
When it is too hot, the erector muscle 
relaxes, causing the hairs to lie flat.  
Arterioles below the epidermis dilate 
or widen, causing more blood and heat 
to flow near the surface 
(Vasodilation). Increases in sweat 
production. Sweat evaporates using 
latent heat which cools the body. 
Develop a cartoon or another visual 
to explain the role of the skin in 
controlling body temperature.

Formulate a hypothesis on 
whether insulation affects the rate 
at which organisms lose heat. 
Endotherms are animals (birds and 
mammals) that keep their body 
temperature constant despite 
changes in the external temperature. 
They make heat inside their body 
and keep it there.  Animals with lots 
of hair or fur contract their erector 
muscles so the hairs stand up and 
trap a layer of air between them, 
insulating the body and preventing 
heat loss. The erector muscles in 
animals with a sparse covering of 
hair still contract in cold weather, 
but give rise to goose pimples. 
Ectotherms are animals (fish, 
amphibians and reptiles) whose 
body temperature changes with the 
temperature of the surroundings. 
They gain heat from outside their 
body. These animals lack hair and 
fur so they bask in the sun to keep 
warm or retreat to holes in the 
ground to cool down. They always 
stay in a place where the 
temperature is suitable.

To investigate the effect of 
insulators on heat loss. 
Materials, such as cotton wool, trap 
air. Since air is a poor conductor of 
heat, this acts as insulation and helps 
to retain heat. The less insulation, 
the more and faster heat is lost.  
 
Collect two conical flasks of the 
same size. Secure cotton wool 
around one of the flasks. Measure 
and record the temperature of the 
water in both flasks every minute 
for 20 minutes. Calculate the total 
drop in each flask.  Make valid

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT 
Critically assess the value 
of national parks and 
protected areas in The 
Bahamas.   
Replenishment, value of marine protected areas 
to  fishery resources, 25 National Parks;  role of 
Bahamas National Trust 
More than 700,000 Acres protected; marine and 
terrestrial sites;  New areas being developed  
Marine protected areas (MPA)  may be 
established for several reasons including 
protecting species, ecosystems, biodiversity, 
vulnerable & rare habitats, breeding & nursery 
grounds, historical & cultural sites; In The 
Bahamas the MPAs are the  marine reserves or 
marine parks;  maintain and restore  
biodiversity and protect marine habitats; 4 
established marine parks; benefit fisheries 
through spillover - movement of adult fish 
outside MPA into adjacent fisheries areas;  
larval export, target species, protected within a 
reserve serve as breeding stocks, are dispersed 
outside of the reserve and mature in other 
fisheries areas. First MPA in 1958, the Exuma 
Land and Sea Park; marine area became a no-
take marine reserve in 1986; evidence has 
shown that invertebrates and fish are larger and 
more abundant, increasing the population 
available for the local fishing industry.  MPAs 
provide place for education about marine 
ecosystems and conservation; serve as an 
ecotourism and recreational dive site. 
• Read newspaper articles 
and/or internet articles or 
attend town meetings called 
by non-governmental and 
governmental environmental 
protection agencies. 
• Compare the benefits of 
MPAs with the perceived 
threats to local fishing.  
• Prepare a letter to your 
representative (parliament or 
local government) supporting  
or opposing the nearest 
proposed park in your area, 
justify  your position 
• List the objectives of the 
national parks. 
• Conduct research (Internet or 
interviews) to determine the  
effectiveness of three parks in 
meeting their objectives. 
• Identify the threats to the 
national parks achieving their 
objectives. 
• Participate in a debate on 
whether national parks and 
protected areas are effectively 
achieving the set objectives.

DNA is found in every living organism 
and is present in every cell of the body. 
The DNA in each cell contains all the 
same information as the original 
fertilized egg. The chromosomes 
present in the nucleus are made of 
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA is 
made of a double chain formed by 
repeating small chemical units called 
nucleotides. Each nucleotide (arranged 
as in a ladder- like structure) is made 
up of a sugar called deoxyribose, a 
phosphate group and a nitrogenous 
compound.

Relate the DNA molecule to 
chromosome structure. 
Chromosomes are thread-like 
structures within a cell’s nucleus 
which contain the genetic information 
that is passed from one generation to 
the next. Chromosomes are composed 
of a very long strand of DNA, coiled 
many times. Sections of DNA form 
genes. Analogy- DNA = letters, genes 
= words, chromosomes = books.

For some insects, DDT is a poison. 
Others developed DDT resistance - 
when DDT was introduced into the 
ecosystem, insects with a variation 
showing resistance to DDT were 
favoured as were not harmed by DDT. 
They then were able to survive and 
reproduced while others without this 
variation died. 
Where antibiotics are used many 
bacteria died. But antibiotics-resistant 
bacteria survived and reproduced and 
produced bacteria with that variation.

Observe various types of tropisms. 
A Tropism is the growth and 
movement of a plant in response to a 
stimulus. There are many types of 
tropism and they are: Thigma-tropism 
(stimulus is temperature) touch, 
hydrotropism (stimulus is water), 
phototropism (stimulus is sunlight), 
geotropism (stimulus is gravity). 
Tropism can be positive (growth 
occurs in the direction of the stimulus) 
or negative (growth occurs in the 
direction opposite the stimulus). 
• Observe photographs showing 
tropisms. 
 
• Use concept map to identify 
the different types of 
tropisms.

Geotropism is the type of tropism that 
responds to gravity. Gravity always 
acts downward on objects. Hence 
growth in response to gravity shall 
always occur in the downward 
motion; growth occurring opposite to 
gravity would be considered negative 
geo-tropism.

Explain the role of auxins in tropic 
responses.  
 
 
Auxin is a hormone found in the tip 
of the shoot of a plant and it aids in 
growth and movement of a plant in 
response to a stimulus. In 
phototropism, there is one side of a 
shoot that may receive more sunlight 
than the other. Auxin diffuses down 
the shoot causing the cells in the 
dark to grow faster and becoming 
more elongated. This actually causes 
the bending of the shoot towards 
sunlight.  When the shoot bends in 
direction of the stimulus it is said to 
be a positive  
response. 
Make an oral presentation 
explaining the role of auxins in 
tropic responses.

Design an experiment to verify the 
role of root and shoot tips in 
tropisms.  
Inside the tip of the shoot is where 
auxin (the hormone that controls 
growth and movement within plants) 
is found. Removal of the tip of the 
shoot would result in stagnant or a halt 
in growth and movement of a plant 
upwards, however, lateral buds will 
give rise to side branches.

Explain the process of seeing. 
 
 
Light rays pass through the lens and 
into the eye and are focused onto the 
retina. The image on the retina is 
upside down due to the actual bending 
of light. The brain, once the messages 
reach the brain then inverts the image 
and we see things right side up. 
Normally when a person is looking at 
an object from agar, the ciliary 
muscles relaxes and pulls the lens into 
a flat shape. When an object is being 
observed in close view, the ciliary 
muscles contract and the lens takes on 
its normal short round shape. The 
movement of the lens in this manner is 
called accommodation.  
 
• Follow the pathway of light 
from an object to the cornea,

Explain the process of hearing. 
 
 
Sound waves hit against the pinna and 
are directed into the ear through the 
auditory canal. The sound waves beat 
against the ear drum. In the middle ear 
the hammer begins to vibrate causing 
the anvil and stirrup to do the same 
causing sound waves to be created in 
the middle ear and amplified. The 
sound waves then travel through the 
round window into the inner ear into 
the cochlea of which chemical 
messages are created and are sent to 
the brain through the auditory nerves 
and they are interpreted and then we 
hear. 
• Follow the pathway of sound

Tabulate the differences 
between sexual and asexual 
reproduction, highlighting 
the advantages and 
disadvantages. 
 
Asexual Reproduction 
Advantages 
1. Large numbers of offspring 
produced. 
2. Offspring can be produced 
continuously.  
3. Offspring can make good use of 
favorable environmental 
conditions. 
4. If parent is of superior quality 
the offspring will be the same. 
Disadvantages 
1. Overcrowding and competition 
may occur as offspring colonise 
the same area as parent. 
2. If the environment is changing, 
the offspring may find it difficult 
to survive. 
3.   If the parent is of inferior quality 
the offspring will also be 
inferior. 
 
Sexual Reproduction 
Advantages 
1. Genetic variability of the species 
is increased.  
2. The species is more 
likely to be able to adapt to a 
changing environment. 
3. The species may be able to 
colonize new areas. 
4. If the parents are both of poor 
quality, the offspring may be of 
better quality. 
 
 
Disadvantages 
1.Time and energy spent on seeking 
mate. 
2. Offspring are  not produced  
continuously.  
3.Few offspring may be produced. 
4. Even if the parents are of good 
quality, the offspring can be of poor 
quality.

Relate the events in the ovary 
during a menstrual cycle to the 
differences in hormone levels 
during a cycle. 
 
The menstrual phase – if ovum not 
fertilized, it breaks down. Low levels of 
oestrogen and progesterone. During the 
follicular phase, the pituitary produces 
increasing amounts of follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) which acts on the ovary, 
causing several follicles, each containing 
an ovum, to develop. Only one follicle 
matures. The ovaries secrete lots of 
oestrogen. During the ovulatory phase, 
the hypothalamus and pituitary secrete 
release a surge of luteinizing hormone 
(LH) which causes the mature follicle to 
burst and release the ovum. In the luteal 
phase, the ruptured follicle develops into 
the corpus luteum which secretes 
increasing amounts of progesterone. 
• Make a diagram showing the 
dates of the month (1 – 28) as 
the X- axis of a graph, then 
draw (on the Y- axis) the 
relative amounts of oestrogen 
and progesterone present

Fertilization is the fusion of the male 
nucleus with the female nucleus. It occurs 
in the oviduct. Once sperm reach the 
ovum, each attaches itself to the ovum, 
but only one penetrates its membrane. 
Enzymes in the head (acrosome) of the 
sperm break down the wall of the ovum, 
preventing other sperm from entering. The 
nucleus of the sperm then fuses with the 
nucleus of the ovum.

APPENDIX I 
RUBRIC FOR ASSESSMENT 
 
What is Rubric? 
 
Rubric – a set of guidelines for assessment which states the characteristics and/or dimensions being 
assessed with clear performance criteria and a rating scale. – Policy on Assessment and Evaluation 
published by the Scarborough Board of Education, 1977.  
 
A scoring rubric consists of: 
• A fixed scale 
• A list of characteristics/criteria describing performance for each of the points on a scale. 
• Clear performance targets for students. 
 
How to design a Rubric  
• Select a result/results based on a learner outcome that will be assessed. 
• Describe a superior performance. 
• Describe a low-level performance. 
• Set different level performances between the high and low level performances described.  
• Explain the scoring criteria to students. 
• Use examples to assist students in using the rubric as a means of demonstrating their understanding.  
 
Examples of Rubric are included in this document to assist teachers in effectively using alternative 
methods of assessment. However, the use of Rubric for assessment is not limited to the categories 
shown. Teachers are encouraged to develop similar Rubric to assess learner outcomes or student 
activities that are not included. Additionally, teachers are expected to develop score sheets based on 
the criteria. An example is shown.

Scientific Literacy is an essential support for sustainable development in the global economy. It therefore stands to reason that one of the main goals of the Science Instructional Programme would 
be the promotion of Scientific Literacy. 
 
The benefits that accrue from the promotion of Scientific Literacy in the curriculum are numerous. For, as Scientific Literacy increases, so does the students’ appreciation of the application of 
scientific principles to problem solving. In addition, students are encouraged to focus their creative energies, spawned by alert inquiring minds, to produce positive end results that can be of 
economic, social and emotional value to themselves and society. 
 
As educators zealously attempt to prepare students for coping with the challenges of life in a technology driven world, care should be taken to incorporate current and innovative practices in the 
Science Instructional Programme. These and other instructional strategies will: 
 
Motivate students to increase their understanding of the subject through practical immersion and discovery encounter experiences. 
 
Increase the effectiveness of Science instruction 
 
Build students’ confidence and competence 
 
Heighten students’ expectations 
 
Promote higher overall achievement 
 
This section is intended to provide teachers at the primary level with a wide range of perspectives and innovative practices for implementing an effective Science Instructional Programme. These 
strategies comprise: 
 
Inquiry-based Learning  
 
Constructivism 
 
Bloom’s Taxonomy 
 
Process Skills Development 
 
Use of the Scientific Method 
 
Cooperative Learning Technique

Inquiry–based Learning places emphasis on experiential learning; where practical “hands-
on” activities are used to motivate students to focus their innate curiosities and inquiring 
minds on problem solving through the application of scientific principles. 
 
Proponents of the traditional “lecture method” of instruction (i.e. imparting information 
directly from text books with limited or no opportunity for students to engage exploration, 
questioning and discovery skills) are rapidly being convinced that this strategy (with respect 
to the teaching of Science) is very ineffective, and when compared with other modern 
approaches is now obsolete. 
 
Research has shown that frequent use of the lecture method especially with regards to the 
teaching of Science results in diminished student expectation and achievement. Research 
“shows that people don’t learn science by absorbing stuff that has been poured unto them (via 
lectures) but rather by constructing meaning out of experiences that the teacher provides.” 
Wendy Saul, Science Education Analyst; University of Maryland, Baltimore County, U.S.A. 
 
In Inquiry–based Learning, opportunities are provided that create an environment that 
enable students to gain experience as a result of Science exploration. Practical experiences 
are provided and open-ended questions asked to encourage experimentation that does not 
necessarily have a known outcome and that will lead to testable questions. During this 
experimentation, students are encouraged to take risks and are therefore, not afraid to make 
mistakes. Some of the greatest scientific discoveries come after many failures and 
disappointments. 
 
Inquiry–based learning goes beyond providing students with opportunities for practical, 
“hands–on” experiences to illustrate established scientific principles e.g. giving them 
batteries, bulbs, and wires to show the concept of current electricity. This strategy takes the 
learning process to a different level e.g. It may challenge students to use the batteries, bulb, 
wire and additional materials to develop something useful for a deaf person or something that 
can assist with a specific chore, homework assignment, etc. 
 
The inquiry–based approach to the teaching of Science is key to effective and meaningful 
instruction as it encourages students to: 
♦ Critically evaluate situations 
♦ Frame their own questions 
♦ Develop diverse strategies for coping with problems in their environment 
♦ Cultivate organizational and creative skills 
♦ Assume leadership roles and be self motivated 
♦ Be accountable for their learning 
♦ Collaborate and communicate with one another 
♦ Develop team interaction skills

Constructivism is closely related to Inquiry-based Learning therefore, effective application 
of Inquiry-based Learning is enhanced by Constructivism. Constructivism means 
generating meaning by connecting what is to be learned with personal knowledge that has 
been constructed from past experiences. “A Constructivist is one who believes that the 
learner is responsible for constructing knowledge and, therefore, the responsibility for 
learning must be returned to the child.” Ebenezer & Conner 1998, Learning to Teach Science, 
A Model for the 21ST Century. 
 
Students’ understanding of the world is moulded by their experiences. As they think about 
these experiences, their views and beliefs, they construct personal meaning and acquire 
knowledge. Constructivists advocate that students should not be expected to just accept 
knowledge and skills developed over the years and imparted by the teacher. Instead they 
become “active seekers” of knowledge as inquiry is encouraged and they discover and 
decipher things for themselves. 
 
In using Constructivism, teachers become facilitators that create stimulating environments 
with a variety of “hands-on” experiences that empower students to explore. The teacher’s 
main role is to provide experiences that help students make connections between what is 
learned and what they already know or believe. More learning takes place when students 
become active participants in the learning process and are “allowed to make their own sense 
out of the world.” 
 
Providing students with “hands-on” experiences that reinforce ideas or perceptions that they 
already have results in them assimilating or absorbing new concepts easily. The knowledge 
that the students construct from the information that they receive as a result of these “hands - 
on” activities makes sense and is easier for them to relate to and apply to their everyday life 
and their environment. 
 
Constructivists probe students’ knowledge base, examine and classify their concepts then 
provide them with opportunities to share and debate common knowledge. They then convert 
and expand students’ knowledge by asking open-ended questions and presenting problems 
which cause them to gain new understanding of the concepts being taught. By doing this they 
challenge and promote conceptual change. 
 
When using the Constructivism Theory, it should be noted that there are times when 
knowledge has to be imparted directly by the teacher in a detailed and explicit way. Although 
many benefits can be accrued from utilizing the Constructivism Theory if it is not used 
properly, learning may become sporadic and disorganized. Although students should not be 
stifled in their exploration to acquire knowledge, when using this theory it is important to: 
♦ Set clear precise goals for the knowledge and skills that the students are expected to 
acquire 
♦ Communicate these goals to the students and ensure that they are understood 
♦ Organize assignments in a clearly planned sequence 
♦ Provide guidance for the students

STEPPING UP TO HIGHER LEVELS OF THINKING 
 
 
Benjamin Bloom is accredited with identifying a list of 
behavioural terms that are reflective of various levels of 
learning. This list is referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy 
and it enables us to better understand the cognitive level 
at which students process information. Students that 
process information at the higher levels develop critical 
thinking skills and are able to analyse, synthesize, and 
evaluate. They construct new meanings, and become 
original and creative thinkers. Students that process 
information at the lower levels may not become 
independent thinkers and may not be empowered to 
problem solve. The list of 
behavioural terms are as shown. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Students can express objective and subjective opinion 
supported by fact. It is the ability to detect fallacies in 
reasoning based on facts and the ability to judge 
Apply students’ concepts learned to their environment 
and everyday life. They apply knowledge in new and/or 
practical ways to solve new problems in new situations. 
This is the lowest level of understanding. Students are expected to explain materials, 
which may be presented in a variety of forms – paragraphs, tables, charts, graphs, 
cartoons, etc. They also make inferences or solve problems when told what to do. 
Students are able to create a new body of information from 
previous information. It is the ability to put elements together to 
form a new pattern with an emphasis on originality and creativity. 
Students break an idea into its parts, and show that 
they understand their relationship, organization, and 
basic assumptions.

Process skills are practical skills that allow students to use previous experiences, build upon them and link knowledge and skills learned at school to their environment and every day life. 
 
Process skills help students to develop and apply critical thinking. Once given the opportunity to use and apply process skills, students develop the ability to reflect on and to evaluate their 
approaches to problem solving. As a result, students will come to the realization that there may be several solutions to any given problem. In this way, students can formulate hypotheses as 
testable ideas in their minds and can demonstrate deductive patterns of thought. Through integration of the basic and complex process skills listed, students should develop the ability to 
think logically and abstractly. 
 
Basic Process Skills 
Observing 
Using one or more of the five senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling) to find out 
about the world. Observing increases students’ perceptions so that they can learn more about 
objects and events. 
 
Classifying 
Grouping objects or events based on similarities and/or categorizing based on existing 
relationships among objects or events. 
 
Inferring 
Explaining and interpreting observed events and collected data and explaining why they might 
have happened. 
 
Communicating 
Passing on information, proposing interpretations, explanations, and causes from observed 
events and collected data. 
 
Recognizing and Using Spatial Relationships 
Observing where things are in relation to other things by estimating the relative positions of 
moving and non-moving objects to one another. 
 
Measuring 
Finding out the size or amount of an object or substance when compared to a certain unit. 
Identifying and ordering length, area, volume, mass, and temperature to describe and quantify 
objects or events. 
 
Predicting 
Suggesting possible results or outcomes that will happen in the future based on observations  
and inferences drawn form previous experiences. The suggestions have to be based on correct  
information. 
Using Numbers 
Applying ordering, counting, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing to quantify data 
where appropriate in investigations or experiments. 
 
Complex Process Skills 
Interpreting Data 
Explaining the meaning or importance of information. 
 
Forming Hypotheses 
Asking questions about a problem and making assumptions in order to draw out and test 
different solutions to the problem. 
 
Separating and Controlling Variables 
Recognizing the many factors (variables) that affect the relationship of the factors to one 
another so that one factor (variable) can be manipulated while the others are controlled. 
 
Experimenting 
Test hypotheses or predictions by first identifying things (variables) that are important, then 
deciding which variables to change or manipulate which will be held constant, and what results 
to expect. 
 
Formulating Models 
Constructing mental, verbal, or physical representations or ideas, objects, or events. The 
models are then used to clarify explanations or to demonstrate relationships. 
 
Defining Operationally 
Describing the properties of things and their functions. These working definitions are based 
on actual experiences that the student had.

Students need to be taught valuable problem solving skills in order to react appropriately to the many situations that confront them on a daily basis. The Scientific Method sets out 
a sequence of logical steps that are employed in problem solving. It is applicable to ALL areas of life and is not restricted only to the teaching of Science. 
 
The components of the Scientific Method and their descriptors are set out below. It is to be noted that students should utilize this format when writing up experiments or 
laboratory reports. 
 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose is the question that is to be answered by doing the experiment. State the reason or reasons why you are doing 
the experiment. State the purpose as a question needing an answer. 
2. HYPOTHESIS 
A hypothesis is an educated guess on how the experiment/ activity will turn out, that is based on prior knowledge. Although 
a good hypothesis is testable, it may not be correct. Experimenting can find out whether or not he hypothesis is correct or 
not. 
3. MATERIALS 
All materials required for the activity/ experiment need to be identified. One must be as accurate as possible in describing 
the materials. Be sure to give exact amounts and quantities. 
4. PROCEDURE 
The procedure describes everything that will be done during the experiment. The procedure affects the result of the 
experiment therefore, care should be taken to explain the procedure as accurately as possible. State the procedure as 
numbered steps. (It would help if they are written with behavioural terms at the beginning.) 
5. OBSERVATION 
The observation describes exactly what happens during an experiment. Report the observations made and the data collected 
during the experiment. Data are recorded facts or measurements from an experiment. Data should be presented as tables, 
charts, and graphs, to be easily understood. 
6. CONCLUSION 
The conclusion is a comparison between the results and the hypothesis of an experiment. To draw a conclusion, the data 
needs to be analyzed to see what is meant. Explain observations and describe how the data relates to the problem. The 
conclusion should state whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Part of the conclusion may be a statement or a new 
hypothesis based on findings and suggestions for testing the new hypothesis in a further experiment.

The Cooperative Learning Technique allows all students to have a sense of accomplishment. 
Cooperative Learning promotes group work and opportunities for verbal face-to-face interactions, which 
assist students to acquire and apply concepts. 
 
Cooperative Learning builds interpersonal skills and positive interdependence characterized by specific 
roles, sharing of knowledge and materials and achievement of mutual goals. It encourages group processing 
as students analyse how well their groups are functioning and design and employ strategies to ensure that 
they function effectively. 
 
When using the Cooperative Learning Technique, the teacher functions as a facilitator and students are 
more accountable for their learning and share the responsibility for the learning of others. It is important for 
the teacher to set and evaluate social and academic goals for the groups and the quantity and quality of 
students’ learning. 
 
When forming cooperative groups, it is recommended that groups work together for three to six weeks 
before students are assigned new roles or groups changed. During the year, each student should have an 
opportunity to function in each role. Once groups are formed, ensure that all members realize that they are 
jointly responsible for achieving group goals. They do this by: 
• 
Contributing ideas to the group 
• 
Listening carefully for ideas from others 
• 
Helping the group make good decisions 
• 
Cooperating rather than competing 
• 
Solving problems in a calm manner

Student-centred Learning develops self-directed learners who are confident in doing Science, proactive in the learning process 
and willing to share and accept responsibility for their own learning. Student-centred Learning activities are adaptive and 
cater to the learning needs of students. 
 
COMPARISON OF STUDENT-CENTRED AND TEACHER- CENTRED LEARNING 
 
STUDENT-CENTRED 
♦ 
Students’ conceptions and experiences are explored. 
♦ 
Teacher challenges students to question before accepting information. 
♦ 
Discussion is encouraged between students and teacher. 
♦ 
Students are allowed to move about in an orderly manner to discuss 
and problem solve. 
♦ 
Students share and help each other. They use peer tutoring. 
♦ 
Students actively participate in decision-making. 
♦ 
Learning activities cater to multiple intelligences and different learning 
styles. 
 
TEACHER-CENTRED 
♦ 
Teacher is the authority figure and has the final say. 
♦ 
Students must never question the teacher. 
♦ 
Students only respond when a question is asked. 
♦ 
Students must remain seated at all times. 
♦ 
Collaboration between students is discouraged and regarded as 
cheating. 
♦ 
Students do not participate in decision-making. 
♦ 
There is very little variation in learning activities.

HOWARD GARDNER 
 
The theory of Multiple Intelligences is a way of understanding the different facets of the intellect and each person’s level of intelligence. The intelligences can work 
individually or in collaboration with the other intelligences, so a person could be operating in more than one intelligence. As we teach children, we should ensure that 
appropriate provision is made for individual differences and multiple intelligences. 
 
 
 
Linguistic Intelligence is a person’s ability to construct and comprehend language. It is the capacity to use language to express feelings and to understand other people. It 
may be in a person’s native language or another language. Poets, writers, orators, speakers, lawyers specialize in linguistic intelligence. 
 
 
Naturalist Intelligence is the ability to identify and classify patterns in nature. It the way a person relates to his environment and the recognition of the role that the 
environment plays in our lives. It is the ability to discriminate among living things like plants and animals and sensitivity to changes in nature e.g. weather patterns, rock 
configurations. 
 
 
Spatial Intelligence is how persons comprehend shapes and images in three dimensions. Spatial Intelligence is utilized to perceive and interpret things that we may or may 
not see. It is the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind--the way a sailor navigates the seas with only the stars or airplane pilot navigates aerial space, 
or the way a chess player or sculptor represents the spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences. Persons with this type of Spatial Intelligence 
are usually painters, sculptors, architects and scientists who deal with anatomy and topology. 
 
 
Musical Intelligence is the ability to perform and compose music. It is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, remember them, and 
perhaps manipulate them. Persons with strong musical intelligence are completely preoccupied with music, it is always playing in their minds. Persons with musical 
intelligence use music to face their challenges and to assist them in solving their problems. 
 
 
Bodily - Kinesthetic Intelligence is a natural sense of how the body should act and react in demanding situations. These persons have extraordinary control of their 
movements, balance, agility and grace. They have the capacity to use their whole body or parts of their body to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of a 
production. Bodily - Kinesthetic Intelligence is evident in athletes and persons in the performing arts, particularly dance or acting. 
 
 
Logical – Mathematical Intelligence is the ability to mentally process logical problems. Persons with a highly developed Logical-Mathematical Intelligence can 
manipulate numbers, operations and quantities, and they have the ability to process logical questions at an unusually fast rate. These persons have the ability to understand 
the underlying principles of some kind of a causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does.

 
Intrapersonal Intelligence is a person’s cognitive ability to sense and understand him or herself. It refers to a very strong self-concept and strength of character, which 
gives the person the ability to solve internal problems. These persons know who they are, what they can do, what they want to do, how they react to things, which things to 
avoid, and which things to gravitate toward. These persons have a strong sense of purpose and are not easily deterred from that purpose. They know their strengths and their 
limitations and know where to go if they need help. 
 
 
Interpersonal Intelligence is understanding and interacting with others and interpreting their behaviour. As social beings, it is an essential ability that we all need however, 
persons with Interpersonal Intelligence have a greater perception of distinctions between persons and have the ability to judge their moods, temperaments, intentions and 
motivations. Persons with Interpersonal Intelligence become teachers, clergy, leaders, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians. Anybody who deals with other people has to 
be skilled in the interpersonal sphere. 
 
 
 
 
 
DAVID A. KOLB 
 
Persons have their unique, individual way of learning. Understanding how students learn and planning activities that cater to various learning styles will enhance their 
learning and ensure higher achievement. 
 
 
Visual Style 
Persons who prefer the visual style convert what they hear and read to pictorial images in their brain. When recalling information they go through a process similar to 
reviewing pictures in a movie. These students have no problems in obeying conventional classroom rules. They will sit quietly, write neatly and use all materials well. 
These persons often choose careers like engineer, surgeon, designer, architect and positions of leadership that requires visionary thinking. 
 
 
Auditory Style 
These persons learn best by hearing and listening, they process information through their listening and repeating skills. They are good storytellers and can successfully talk 
through their problems. These students can easily repeat what they heard just as it was said. They are the most talkative and the most likely to participate in discussion 
however, they may experience difficulty in writing. These persons often become psychologists, disc jockeys, great musicians and other occupations that require a great deal 
of listening. 
 
 
Kinesthetic Style 
These persons process and remember information through their bodies and their feelings. Kinesthetic learners need to touch and feel what they are learning about. They 
may become restless unless they are actively involved in the learning process.

WHAT IS ASSESSMENT? 
 
♦ Whenever we interact with other people we obtain and interpret information about their knowledge 
and understanding, and may well make judgments about their ideas, abilities and attitudes. 
 
♦ Assessment whether direct or indirect is a human encounter and is a central feature of social life. 
 
♦ Educational assessment includes a wide range of methods for evaluating student performance that 
describes the nature and extent of learning and how it matches up to the objectives of teaching. 
 
When assessing there must be alignment between what is in the curriculum, what is actually taught and 
what is tested. 
 
WHY DO WE ASSESS? 
 
♦ The main purpose of assessment is to judge the attainment or performance level of students, with a 
view of evaluating or grading them for one purpose or another. 
 
♦ Purpose might include: 
 
⇒ Placing students in appropriate teaching sets; 
⇒ Providing extra motivation for learning and an aid to remembering; 
⇒ Informing parents about progress; 
⇒ Informing other teachers who have to make decisions about students e.g. when students transfer 
to a new school or new courses, which may have been studied; 
⇒ Accumulating records of achievement; 
⇒ Acting as a diagnostic tool e.g. diagnosing weaknesses so that remedial action may be taken; 
⇒ Making decisions about examination entries involving predictions about future performance; 
⇒ Informing further education institutions or employers about attainment so that suitable placement 
may be made. In doing this, we are using measured attainment to make predications about likely 
future performance. 
 
Hence assessment has primarily been used as a means of judging the attainment and progress of students, 
providing a reporting system and deciding appropriate action. 
 
FORMS OF ASSESSMENT 
Assessment may be: 
⇒ Informal 
⇒ Formal 
♦ Informal assessment takes place during normal learning activities. Much information can be picked 
up by teachers in their normal interaction with individual students, allowing problems to be overcome 
at an early stage and progress accelerated. Hence informal assessment is often used diagnostically. 
 
♦ It is often said that informal assessment should be unobtrusive if the teacher is to gain reliable 
insights about students’ abilities and the state of development, and that it should be for a specific 
purpose and for private use only. 
 
♦ With formative i.e. informal assessment the results are fed back to the learner. Such feedback can be 
confirmatory (a recognition that the particular tasks have been mastered at that particular time) or 
can be corrective, allowing dialogue between teacher and learner to show where the learner went 
wrong. 
 
♦ Formal assessment is only aimed at obtaining knowledge about the student. It is obtrusive and may 
not be able to provide direct instructional function. 
 
♦ Formal assessment becomes summative when information is not available for feedback purposes 
because it is obtained too late in the learner’s career to be used in this way. 
 
♦ Formal and summative assessment is used largely for public purposes (e.g. BJC, BGCSE and RSA 
Examinations) 
 
♦ Even this is changing with the advent of initiatives such as the GLAT where formal and summative 
assessments are made with students at grade 3 and 6. The results of formal assessments made at an 
early stage can be used for the benefit of the learner at the next stage of education. 
 
ASSESSMENT MAY ALSO BE TRADITIONAL OR AUTHENTIC 
 
Traditional Assessment measures what the students were taught and basically assesses their ability to 
recall information. This type of assessment includes homework, quizzes and tests. 
 
Authentic Assessment measures what students have actually learned and can promote further learning. 
This type of assessment includes portfolios, journal keeping, anecdotal records, student conferencing, 
self and peer assessment, projects and reports. 
 
Although there is no alternative for traditional assessment in certain situations, authentic assessment 
should be frequently used in the High School Science Instructional Programme.
