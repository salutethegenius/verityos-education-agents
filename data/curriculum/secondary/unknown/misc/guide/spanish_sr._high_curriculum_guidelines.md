3 | B a h a m a s  M i n i s t r y  o f  E d u c a t i o n   S p a n i s h  C u r r i c u l u m  G u i d e l i n e s  
 
 
A curriculum is considered the “heart” of any learning institution, which means that schools or universities cannot 
exist without a curriculum. With its importance in formal education, curriculum has become a dynamic process due to 
the changes that occur in our society. Therefore, in its broadest sense, curriculum refers to the “total learning 
experiences of individuals not only in school, but in society as well”  
(Bilbao et al., 2008). 
 
I have always believed in the transformative power of education, particularly in a developing country, and I 
strongly support the government’s commitment to sustainable development in education.  Indeed, because 
of the role of the curriculum in the provision of quality education, I am honoured to sanction and present 
revised national curricula in several disciplines.  Each curriculum document was developed by a team of 
intelligent, innovative and diligent education officers, who received invaluable input from teachers and 
lecturers; students and parents; as well as private and public stakeholders. 
 
In keeping with the changing demands of education and life in the twenty-first century, revised curricula have 
moved away from a content-based, knowledge-focused approach.  The new documents focus on higher-
order thinking skills; cross-curricula understanding; collaboration; creativity and real-world problem solving.  
With a view to strengthening national development activities, the new curriculum documents accommodate 
the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SGAs), ensuring that at each grade level there are clear 
processes and procedures which allow teachers to align instructional strategies and classroom-based 
assessments to agreed international standards and benchmarks.  
 
The publication, dissemination and successful implementation of these curriculum guidelines will further 
unite us in our efforts to create citizens of character, who are committed to life-long learning and who are 
always willing to serve. 
 
To the education officers, subject specialists and teachers, who are devoted to transforming the lives of 
students throughout The Bahamas, thank you for your continued contributions to the building of our 
country!

Ministry of Education Mission Statement 
 
The Mission of the Ministry/Department is to provide opportunities for all persons in The Bahamas to receive 
the education and training that will equip them with the necessary beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills 
required for work and life in an interdependent, ever changing world. 
 
Modern Languages Unit: 
 
Vision 
 
We envision a Bahamas where students are linguistically, culturally and technologically equipped to 
communicate successfully in the target language, which will inspire a life-long interest in and develop an 
appreciation for diverse cultures, thereby creating windows of opportunity in our global village. 
 
Mission Statement 
 
To ensure student proficiency in the target language we will continue to enhance the learning environment 
by providing relevant curricula, producing indigenous materials and facilitating teacher development 
programs. 
 
Belief Statements 
 
We believe: 
1. skills in more than one language are necessary for global communication and 21st century citizenship. 
 
2. proficiency in a foreign language enhances self-confidence, improves one’s sense of academic achievement, 
heightens creativity and sharpens mental flexibility. 
 
3. foreign language instruction provides students with an improved awareness of their own language and culture. 
 
4. language and culture are inseparable and are best taught in an integrated manner. 
 
5. foreign language programmes guide students into an increased awareness and appreciation of their traditions, 
customs, and values as well as those of Hispanic countries. 
 
6. best teaching practices will enhance learning opportunities, increase motivation and reduce performance anxiety.

RATIONALE 
 
The reality of globalization has put The Bahamas in a position where to survive economically it has to 
be able to compete internationally. Our unique location places us in an enviable position at the crossroads 
between Europe and the Americas, including The Caribbean.   Our geographical proximity to these diverse 
countries demands that, for survival, we forge social, economic and political partnerships with bodies such as 
CARICOM, WTO, NAFTA, FTAA, and OAS.  It is incumbent upon all educators to prepare students for the 
multi-lingual world if they want to compete in any arena.   Effective communication is of paramount 
importance as it is at the heart of the human experience. 
 
To be linguistically challenged at this time in our development is not an option. The Bahamas has 
come to realize that Spanish is the predominant second language in our region, followed by French. It is 
therefore imperative that we develop language competency in Spanish as we develop our economy in 
Tourism, International Banking, Trade and Investment and other industries. 
 
In order to keep pace with these changing times, the Department of Education has revised the 
Spanish curricula. Since studies show that language-learning is more effective at an early age, the programme 
at the primary school level will lay the foundation for the secondary level. 
 
These revised curricula will promote levels of attainment in the four language domains: listening, 
speaking, reading, and writing, as our students prepare for the national examinations.  In so doing, we will be 
well on our way to becoming a multi-lingual nation.  The new thrust is on communicative objectives in 
authentic situations as opposed to topics in isolation.  Teaching strategies must incorporate functional 
language skills.   The curricula must cater to the diverse needs of students and are therefore student-
centered.  These integrated curricula reinforce links with other disciplines and promote an appreciation for 
cultural diversity. 
It is hoped that students will develop a positive attitude towards foreign language learning, and in the 
process, develop a greater measure of their true potential as life-long learners.

A GUIDE TO TEACHING FROM THE DOCUMENT 
 
Points to consider: 
   
 
This revised document includes topics which are affiliated with the relevant communicative objectives. 
This makes use of the communicative objectives more effective. More than one communicative 
objective may be affiliated with the same topic(s).  Therefore, no suggested sequence for the teaching 
of the communicative objectives is provided. In addition, more than one topic may be affiliated with 
one communicative objective. In such cases the vocabulary and suggested activities will not 
incorporate all of the topics.  
  
 
Instructional strategies must be designed for the diverse needs of students. 
 
 
Teachers must familiarize themselves with the Standards and Scope and Sequence for the attainment 
level 
 
 
The communicative objectives for the primary school grades are not always the same as those for the 
junior high grades. 
 
 
Sub-Goals 1.1 – 1.5 are not intended to be taught separately.  They should be integrated in all 
communicative objectives.  These Sub-Goals will not be presented at each level of the Scope of Work.   
Where they do appear, they are examples and content may overlap with other areas of the Scope of 
Work.   
 
 
Once the communicative objectives have been decided, teachers can refer to the Scope of Work for 
suggested vocabulary, structures, activities, assessment and resources. Teachers are not limited to 
using the suggested textbooks/resources. They must beware of unnecessary repetition and adapt to 
meet the needs of the students. 
 
 
CULTURE must be integrated. 
 
 
Interdisciplinary links, including integrated technology, must be fostered. 
 
 
An Assessment Weighting Guide is included in the appendices.   
 
Teachers should build on previous knowledge as outlined in the Scope of Work.   Teachers should note that 
although Curriculum Levels are aligned to Grade Levels, they should meet the needs of their students. Feeder 
schools should provide receiving schools with accurate information regarding students’ attainment levels.   
 
Incidental teaching is not reflected in the Scope of Work.   From the Scope and Sequence, teachers can 
determine when these teachable moments occur, across the levels, and need to be addressed.

DEVELOPING THE FOUR LINGUISTIC 
SKILLS 
 
The FOUR Linguistic Skills should be integrated in the communicative objectives so that students can develop 
varying levels of proficiency and critical thinking skills in the target language.

Communicate effectively in the target language

Develop their listening comprehension skills in the target language in order to:
