PREFACE 
 
What are the competencies and skills required for young people which will enable them 
to benefit from and make a valuable contribution to a rapidly changing world? 
 
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has identified 
some of the skills which the 21st century individual should possess in order to have the 
ability to perform tasks and solve problems.  They include critical thinking, responsibility, 
decision making, flexibility1, creativity, assessing information, problem solving, teamwork, 
effective communication (oral and written), analyzing information and entrepreneurialism.  
 
The digital age which has been ignited by changes in technology, from the use of a 
Typewriter to a Word Processing Program; the landline telephone to mobile smartphones; 
from the model T’ car to the Tesla (driverless cars) have required new skills to gain access 
to, evaluate and integrate information. 
 
This Computer Science curriculum document for Grades 7 – 9 has been designed to 
address the needs of the 21st century and beyond student.  At the end of this program, 
students will be able to create, produce and perform tasks or skills that are transferrable 
for home use, for skills required for their various careers and as a tool used in their own 
entrepreneurial business.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 
“Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas 
imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.” 
— Albert Einstein  
 
In today’s world, the concept of “Life imitating Art” is displayed all around us. 21st century 
technology has far surpassed what its forefathers such as Charles Babbage, Alan Turning, Bill 
Gates and Steve Jobs would have ever predicted or imagined. 
 
Computers Science has evolved so rapidly that cloud storage, data protection, social media and 
artificial intelligence are synonymous terms used in our daily lives. Developing APPs for 
consumers to utilize for e-commerce and e-learning have shifted how data and information are 
delivered and used. 
  
It is now vital more than ever, that students are equipped with the required tools and information 
to be able to manipulate various technological devices that will assist in whatever career(s) 
undertaken.  
   
To this end, revisions to the Computer Science curriculum was undertaken. However, we give 
recognition to our predecessors who had the foreknowledge to develop the curriculum. These 
persons include Mrs. Faye Bascom, Mrs. Keyshan Bastian, and Mrs. Gwendolyn Johnson.  
  
In 2019, under the guidance of Education Officer for Junior High Business Studies, Ms. Aldeka 
Colebrooke, a revised curriculum was drafted specifically for the Junior High School.  
  
A team of dedicated and knowledgeable teachers in Computer Science from New Providence as 
well as the Family Islands was formed. Appreciation and thanks are extended to Ms. Ginger 
Pickstock (Team Leader), Mrs. Patrilee Hield, Ms. Jewel Munnings, Ms. De’Andra Rolle, Mrs. 
Nerissa Williamson and Mrs. Natasha Sweeting-Uriz, for their selfless commitment and 
collaborative efforts that made this curriculum come to fruition.  
  
Appreciation and thanks are also extended to the teachers and Subject Coordinators of the 
Business Studies section, the Department of Education, local Bahamian and international 
consultants. Sincerest gratitude is extended to all other stakeholders who may have in some way 
contributed to the completion of this document to ensure that students are competent confident 
and ready to embrace life after their high school experience.

BELIEF STATEMENT 
 
 
 
We believe that: 
 
1. The learning environment should be student centered; 
2. At each grade level students should acquire specific skills to prepare them for the 
succeeding grade level; 
3. All students should have equal opportunity to learn based on their needs, 
interests and abilities; 
4. Students should have opportunities to question, analyze, reason and make 
decisions as well as to develop self-confidence and greater freedom of 
expression; 
5. All students should acquire essential survival skills enabling them to function well 
in society; 
6. Technology should be integrated into content and instruction;  
7. Content should be culturally relevant while still allowing a global perspective;  
8. The methods used for assessing achievement should reflect the teaching and 
learning strategies employed in the curriculum; 
9. Student success is integrally linked to parental involvement and community 
support; 
10. Students will be equipped with the computer skills that will enable them to be 
qualified for an entry level position; 
 
11. Students should be cognizant of the evolving technical world and be able to 
assimilate to the changes in technology. 
 
12. Students will be able to integrate their computer skills across curriculum.
