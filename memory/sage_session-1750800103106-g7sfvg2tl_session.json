So, straight up from Nassau to the edge of space is quite a distance!\n\nRemember, space exploration is a fascinating field that includes satellites, space stations, and even missions to other planets. If you're interested in space, you might enjoy learning about the Bahamas' role in satellite communication or the astronomy programs at local universities.\n\nKeep reaching for the stars, and who knows, maybe one day a Bahamian astronaut will represent us up there! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf8",
