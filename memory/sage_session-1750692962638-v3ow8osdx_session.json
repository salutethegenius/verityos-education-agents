In the equation 2x + 5 = 15, to solve for x, we need to isolate x. \n\nSubtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5\n2x = 10\n\nNow, divide by 2 on both sides to find the value of x:\n2x/2 = 10/2\nx = 5\n\nGreat effort! Your solution is correct. Remember, in math, it's important to follow the correct steps to find the right answer. Keep up the good work! If you have more math questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask. Right on! \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf8 Right on! \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf8",
