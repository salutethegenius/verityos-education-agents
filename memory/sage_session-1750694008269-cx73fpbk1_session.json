We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5\n2x = 10\n\nNow, we have 2x = 10. To find the value of x, we need to divide by 2 on both sides:\n\n2x \u00f7 2 = 10 \u00f7 2\nx = 5\n\nSo, x = 5. That's the solution! Great job! If you have any more math problems, feel free to ask. Keep up the good work! \ud83c\udf1f",
